### Aegean Islands continue to be overcrowded

[**Aegean Boat Report**](https://www.facebook.com/AegeanBoatReport/) **says seven boats with a total of 296 people arrived on the Greek islands on Friday** as of 20h00\. 98 people arrived on Lesvos, 51 to Chios, 87 to Samos and 60 on Rhodes\.

**The _Financial Times_ reports thousands of refugees could be moved from Greek island camps within weeks** to ease chronic owevrcrowding and make space if Syrians flee from an assault on the Idlib province under plans being discussed by Brussels and Athens\. Migration Commissioner Avramopoulos is due to meet senior Greek officials and Prime Minister Tsipras next week to hammer out a plan to move an initial 3,000 people\.

**This comes after 19 NGOs describe “shameful” conditions on Island camps** \. In Moria for example, “the sewage system does not work and filthy toilet water reaches the tents and mattresses where children sleep”\. Reports of sexual abuse are on the rise and health officials are continuing to resign because of untenable working conditions\. The UNHCR has also urged the Greek government to address severe overcrowding, as more than 7,000 asylum\-seekers in Moria are crammed into shelters built to accommodate just 2,000 people\. **Departures to the mainland continue to be slower than arrivals to Greek islands** — 871 people reached the Aegean islands in the week from September 3 to September 9 while only 504 departed to the mainland\.

With winter arriving, the same issues as always risk plaguing Lesvos: overcrowding and inadequate preparation for the cold\. Will winter come as a big surprise once again this year?

**Several hundreds of people are sleeping in the streets of Sarajevo at the moment** , many of them vulnerable\. More people are coming almost every day\. **Help and donations are needed** , including socks, clothes, and shoes, mostly for men, and blankets or sleeping bags\. If you can help, please contact [Souls of Sarajevo\.](https://www.facebook.com/soulsofsarajevo/)

### 15 asylum\-seekers detained at the Belgrade airport

**Info Park found out that a group of 15 asylum\-seekers from Iran have been held in the Belgrade airport detention unit for four days and will be deported to Tehran** \. The group includes one woman with a baby\. According to Info Park, police beat up several of them on Wednesday night and some got seriously injured, including one person whose arm got broken\. Doctors were not called to help them\. **During the time of detention they were insulted, humiliated, beaten and deprived of access to toilets and showers\.**

The Belgrade Centre for Human Rights says it is not possible to assess the capacity of these premises, as they have never been designed as detention facilities\. In its [2017 report on the right to asylum](http://www.bgcentar.org.rs/bgcentar/eng-lat/annual-report-right-asylum-republic-serbia-2017/) , it adds that people detained there are not entitled to notify a person of their choice that they were deprived of liberty, do not have the right to engage a legal counsel, or the right to be familiarised with the procedure to be applied to them in a language they understand\. Therefore, **they are not even informed** 
**about the possibility to seek asylum** :


> “Foreigners who might be considered as prima facie refugees are simply put on the next available flight to their countries of origin or third countries at the expense of the airlines that flew them in”\.

### No food and terrible conditions in official detention centre

**Journalist [Sally Hayden](https://twitter.com/sallyhayd) reports on terrible living conditions in the Abu Salim detention centre** , as she is in contact with people there through Whatsapp\. **She says they received no food since Tuesday** \. Those detained there include seven pregnant women and a week\-old baby\. **All were returned to Libya under EU policy and locked up indefinitely** \. Mothers there are saying their children are crying because of hunger\.

On Friday, protests took place in front of UNHCR in London ,calling for Eritreans to be evacuated from Libya\.
#### Morocco
### Police continues to crack down on people at the Moroccan coast

**The IOM has updated its numbers, saying 74,501 refugees arrived by sea to Europe in 2018 while 1,586 are dead or missing** \. Of these people, 20,301 arrived to Italy, 21,326 arrived in Greece and **37,336 arrived to Spain** , marking a rapid shift in migration routes\.

234 people were rescued in the Alboran Sea between Morocco and Spain on Friday and 75 people were rescued in the Strait of Gibraltar\.

**The [Association Marocaine des Droits Humains](https://www.facebook.com/AmdhNador/?hc_ref=ARTxHvqL-zuANWLwaNPQD_au0oOW6AiskLrCbJEwqlx2Vt_tBhQaFCKCDDkl2rAhyUI&fref=nf&hc_location=group) continues to report on police violence in Morocco as authorities crack down on migrants along the coast** to bring them to the interior of the country in order to prevent them from leaving for Europe\. S **everal people are in the Tanger hospital with fractures to the knees, hands and feet due to police violence** \. Despite this, people continue to risk their lives trying to reach the EU\. At least two bodies were found along the Nador coast on Thursday\.

### 2,835 rejected asylum seekers are missing in Denmark

[**Jyllands\-Posten**](https://jyllands-posten.dk/indland/politiretsvaesen/ECE10869332/2835-afviste-asylansoegere-er-blevet-vaek/) **reports 2,835 rejected asylum seekers are missing** , creating some distress among right\-wing politicians, who argue they could be “terrorists” or working illegally\. Annelise Marstrand, Danish writer and one of the founders of “Friendly humans” however writes that **for years it has been the government’s goal to limit the number of refugees who receive asylum in Denmark:**


> They have built camps where rejected asylum seekers could live for years under unworthy conditions\. The intention is to motivate them to leave the country \(…\) I know people who have been rejected in Denmark and yet have been granted asylum elsewhere in Europe \(…\) If I had the choice between being imprisoned, stuck and sent back as a second\-class man in an uncertain and dangerous future, I would probably also flee \(…\)
