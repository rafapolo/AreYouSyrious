#### FEATURED

A large\-scale police eviction took place in Šid, Serbia on November 22nd, aiming to remove all undocumented people in transit from the streets of the city\. The action targeted approximately 150 people in and around Šid\. The largest eviction of people was carried out at the settlement in the former Grafosrem industrial facility, but was accompanied by the clearance of multiple other smaller squats throughout the city\.

Outwardly justified as a measure to meet the security concerns of the local population, the operation is clearly part of a larger scheme of internal displacement being realized throughout Serbia during the past week\. Volunteers of No Name Kitchen present on site strongly condemn the forced removal of systemically marginalised communities, and the ruthlessness used during these operations\.
In the days after the operation, volunteers in Šid have been under constant scrutiny\. People have been observed monitoring the volunteer’s house and filming the use of the organisations vehicle\.
In the meantime, while removing those who have witnessed and reported about the violence, irregularities and human rights breach on the borders, the country has recently agreed on the Frontex collaboration\. The European Commission approved a cooperation agreement between Serbia and the EU border agency “to manage immigration and tackle crime at the EU’s external borders\.”

This is today’s Europe\.” Further development led them to sail towards eastern Sicily, while they were waiting to receive information about which port to disembark at\.

### Rejection of 28 asylum seekers from African countries due to a lack of interpreters

Legal aid organizations express concern regarding the unprecedented administrative practice of the Regional Asylum Office of Lesvos, which goes against Greek, European and International law\.

The legal aid organizations operating on the island of Lesvos have been surprised to learn that, from 15 to 20 November, the Regional Asylum Office \(‘RAO’\) of Lesvos has, without any prior notice, served negative asylum decisions on 28 asylum seekers from Sub\-Saharan African countries without conducting the legally mandatory asylum interview\. The Administration justified its decision on the basis of its ‘inability’ to secure interpretation for languages spoken by the asylum seekers, they write in the common press release\.

_In addition_ , they write, _the fact that the majority of the applicants were rejected only a few days after they lodged their asylum applications is in direct contradiction to the statement of RAO Lesvos about “repeated and unsuccessful attempts to find suitable interpretation”_ \.


> The Administration has rejected asylum applications, despite having assessed as credible the evidence in the administrative file of applicants for refugee status\. For example, the Administration rejected an applicant even though it had accepted that he had been subjected to torture by his country’s authorities\.

### No solutions for the unaccompanied children on the islands

“There are currently 4,500 unaccompanied children in Greece\. We proposed to Europe that we keep the 1,500 and the other 3,000 be distributed across the 27 countries\. Unfortunately the response for the accompanying children was not positive and this does not honor Europe,” the Greek prime minister said on Friday\. His government plans to speed up the deportations of rejected asylum seekers\.
#### SLOVENIA

Since the beginning of the year, of a total of 14,000 illegal crossings were identified by the Slovenian authorities, more than 9,000 people have been expelled to Croatia, while 4,000 others have lodged asylum applications\.


[![](https://scd.infomigrants.net/media/resize/my_image_big/97cd00543b0dfb0ad16384f6ce6925781da8e63c.jpeg)](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/20945/vic-the-asylum-seeker-center-in-slovenia-where-almost-no-one-is-left-2-3?fbclid=IwAR04JLYH7tEZP6ZAEiSycK9rr3qNR1Utuzv1r92Xh_bvxxeiBRmzvPO7XbI)


The Vič reception centre is the only and central centre for asylum seekers in the country\. It has two annexes: one in the Kotnikova neighborhood of the capital, which can accommodate 90 people \(mainly single men\) and one in Logatec, 30 minutes from Ljubljana, which can accommodate 100 people \(mainly families and single women\) \.
The issue of collective expulsion at the border with Croatia remain an issue\.
#### ITALY

Continuing our recent reporting on the CPR in Corso Brunelleschi, here are some of the recent demands by those staying in the centre\. 
They announced a hunger strike starting from the 22nd, on the grounds of:


> \- Identification times too long \(6 months\)
 

> \- The inhuman conditions in which we are forced to live
 

> \- The unhealthy places in which we are confined: rooms or cells without windows and without breathable air passage that causes the lack of oxygen
 

> \- The showers and bathrooms that we are forced to use that suck
 

> \- The delay in the administration of the food that arrives at 14\.30 pm or even later
 

> \- The food that sucks
 

> \- The almost lack of hygiene products
 

> \- Health care that does not work
 

> \- The beatings by the security personnel
 

> \- I 2,50eu for maintenance that are not enough
 

> \- Blankets that are not washed
 

> \- Rooms that are 4,20x9, 60sqm including bathroom and toilet with 7 people inside 




#### FRANCE

### Protests against deportations to Afghanistan

A new deportation is scheduled for Tuesday, 26th of November\. According to the available information, there are 45 names on the border police list\. 
Last time more people were added to the ones deported from Sweden, taken on board in Austria, since the deportation flight is financed and chartered by Frontex\. 
There are planned protests outside of the detention facility in Märsta\.

Following the big influx of refugees during the fall of 2015, the government decided to put an end to the more generous asylum policies\. During the summer of 2016 the temporary asylum law was implemented\. It says that those arriving after the 24th November 2015 would be tried in accordance with the temporary asylum law \(extended for another two years in June 2019\) \. In other words, those who have arrived in Sweden after the 24th of November 2015 have fewer chances of being granted protection, and also fewer rights\. The demonstrations also highlighted the ongoing deportations to Afghanistan, which the protesters demand an end to\.

Many people across the country expressed their solidarity in gatherings organised to oppose the ongoing practice of deportations\.

### The government failed in its attempt to criminalize basic human kindness

A federal jury in Tucson, Arizona, has acquitted a humanitarian aid worker who was charged with harboring a pair of migrants from Central America after Border Patrol agents reported seeing him provide food and shelter in the Arizona desert, NPR [reports](https://www.npr.org/2019/11/21/781658800/jury-acquits-aid-worker-accused-of-helping-border-crossing-migrants-in-arizona?utm_source=facebook.com&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=npr&utm_term=nprnews&fbclid=IwAR1ej3KK45Z3QXZrXRSQSaIL8Bjf-cx7oWiqFH52-PkPGoy9AoPdhGmxQ1E&t=1574683535177) \.

It was the second time federal prosecutors had put Scott Warren of the faith\-based border aid group No More Deaths on trial\.
The jury unanimously agreed that he should be found not guilty of ‘harboring undocumented immigrants’\.
