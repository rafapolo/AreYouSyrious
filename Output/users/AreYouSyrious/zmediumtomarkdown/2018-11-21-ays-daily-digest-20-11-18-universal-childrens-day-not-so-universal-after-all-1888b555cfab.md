#### FEATURE

Since 2015, Europol has reported that [over 10,000 refugee children](http://www.dw.com/en/more-than-10000-migrant-children-missing-europol/a-19014669) have gone missing on the European continent\. Some lost their lives while fleeing with their families, but in all of those cases the children’s rights that the western world has polished up individually do not apply, it seems\.

It has been a year since [**the death of Madina Hussiny**](ays-daily-digest-1-6-2018-who-is-responsible-for-the-horrow-we-are-living-in-85ee87c1c3a7) , a little refugee girl who [died on the night of Nov 20](https://www.facebook.com/areyousyrious/posts/zbogom-madina-goodbye-madina-dva-sata-smo-prolazili-hrvatskom-kada-nas-je-polici/916183278530556/) /Nov21\. Though the police, responsible for the pushback that sent them to the dark railroads and, ultimately, her fate, are complicit in Madina’s death, nobody has been found guilty as of today\. 
Later on, as Madina’s family was in serious danger inside of the Croatia’s border territory, an AYS volunteer went to notify the border police\. This volunteer ended up [sentenced at court](http://www.statewatch.org/news/2018/sep/croatia-ays-case.htm) for “assisting an illegal border crossing\.”

While Madina’s death serves as a constant call to some people to always do what they can to prevent such perilous situations, it evidently meant nothing for those here who “serve and protect\.”

Minors are often treated like adults, both by police and by [the reception teams and facilities](ays-news-digest-unaccompanied-minors-in-refugee-centers-45f54d954542) across Europe\. Already last year it was documented that the number of **unaccompanied minors** entering Europe has skyrocketed since the start of the recent crisis in 2015\. The number of unaccompanied children worldwide has increased fivefold\. Among the myriad problems that refugees face, one of the most serious is the issue of education\.
### ‘Universal’ right to education

Overall, about 4 million refugees aged 5 to 17 were out of school in 2017, [GEM Report](http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002659/265996e.pdf) for 2019 notes\. Educational opportunities of children affected by internal migration may be compromised for several reasons, from precarious legal status to poverty, inadequate government attention, or biases and stereotypes\. The legal, educational, and administrative responses to the education plight of the internally displaced are often similar to those for refugees\.
In destination countries, immigrants often leave education early\. According to the GEM report, in the European Union, 10% of natives and 19% of foreign\-born people aged 18 to 24 left school early in 2017\. Dropout can depend on arrival age; outcomes vary considerably by whether students enter host systems at the beginning, middle or end of compulsory education\. Extremists tend to instrumentalize development challenges or exacerbate them to create and exploit a vicious circle of marginalization, particularly affecting the poorest and most vulnerable\.


> The education needs of unaccompanied migrant minors, who are particularly vulnerable to exploitation, are frequently unmet\. 




Their number worldwide increased from 66,000 in 2010–2011 to 300,000 in 2015–2016\. Unfortunately, most of the specially designed programmes for refugees aim at young children, mothers or those who are already enrolled in school, where many young boys and teenagers are left unattended and even stigmatized\.

Faced with crises, most governments’ reflexive response is to offer education to refugee populations in a parallel system\. However, a consensus supposedly developed that this is not a sustainable solution, even though that’s not what it looks like from the practice\. The degree of refugee inclusion varies across displacement contexts\. Prejudice and discrimination are present in many education systems, despite policies against them\. In **Bosnia** , except for a few cases, refugee children have not had the chance to enter the educational system, and now that it has been publicly announced, [the reactions are reportedly very different](https://www.klix.ba/vijesti/bih/djeca-migranti-ce-ici-u-os-brekovica-u-bihacu-mjestani-najavili-ispisivanje-svoje-djece/181119088?utm_medium=Status&utm_source=Facebook&utm_content=181119088&utm_campaign=Klix.ba+Facebook+status&fbclid=IwAR2Kdd-aPXCUhjl9e_gkRuuDQU0dEPD_Db8RnfWl-Pic_pUV9bNGMB2sFDQ) to what one would expect from people who have lived through war — and most of them as refugees, too\.

About 73% of the 86,000 minors who arrived in **Italy** between 2011 and 2016 were unaccompanied\. Despite legislation in 2015 and 2017 aimed at protecting them, only a minority regularly attend school\. In many conflict\-affected countries, internal displacement has strained already struggling education systems\. Financial literacy is low in many traditional regions of countries of origin and low\-skill migrant communities, leaving refugees open to fraud or financial exploitation\. This happens both to the parents of children and to unaccompanied minors, thus affecting greatly the potential future development of children\.
### Case: Croatia

The attitude toward refugee minors in Croatia has not changed significantly since [we reported on it](ays-daily-news-digest-17-1-massive-negligence-of-minors-and-serious-police-abuse-remain-silently-38c0815bdec5) and called out the responsible Ministry\. Even more, unaccompanied minors who are staying in a children’s home in the eastern city Osijek have not been included in school for the past 3 years, adding another issue to the pile that Croatia may have to answer for in Strasbourg\.
The extent to which teacher education includes diversity varies by country, so even when children do get their 70 hours of language learning in Croatia, it is often done by teachers who have not had additional training for teaching Croatian as a second language\.

The example of Ahmad is illustrative\. He has been staying at the Children’s Home in Osijek and nobody included him in high school education, though the facility was obliged to do so\.


> _Today he is 19 and has no qualification, nor the ability to continue his education in Croatia\._ 





The state is taking away valuable time from these children and minors in the state institutions that are responsible for enabling the right to education, but they seem to simply not care, and there are no sanctions for such negligent behavior\. Along with the imperative to enter the system at all, the state should minimize time spent in schools not following the national curriculum or not progressing towards recognized certificates, as such time compromises education trajectories and leaves consequences that our near\-sighted politicians don’t seem to recognize at the moment\.

Children who arrived to the country through the process of resettlement are also not included in the education system, though no official obstacle exists, apart from the 30\-day ‘deadline’\. IOM, the organisation responsible for them, awaits for the Ministry’s decision, but by now we should all be aware that there won’t be any unless we all act and push for progress, if we care about those we are helping and, in their case, working with\.


> Respecting the right to education must go beyond legislation and administrative process\. 




The biggest challenges lie ahead of those who should be included in a high school programme\. The school insists on ‘education accomplishments’, oblivious to the fact that the children have no such opportunities to have accomplishments before they are included in the educational system at all\. Once again, both the parents and the children have no sufficient information on the process and rights in education and do not take part as an equal partner in their own case\.

High school\-aged children are enrolled in elementary school, and the unaccompanied minors still stay at the Juvenile Correctional Facilities\.
On the occasion of the Universal Children’s Day, [GOOD Initiative](http://goo.hr/) and the Initiative Welcome have also called for inclusion of unaccompanied refugee minors in the educational system in Croatia \( [Text](http://welcome.cms.hr/index.php/hr/2018/11/19/ukljucite-djecu-izbjeglice-bez-pratnje-u-skole/) available in Croatian\) \.
#### AFRICA

Who are the people you meet sleeping in the street, in makeshift camps and waiting for months in queues hoping to be allowed to access the system of international protection, by many considered ‘lucky’ to have survived perilous journeys and made it to Europe? Many flee violence and poverty in forgotten places across African countries, before being kidnapped by traffickers and horribly abused in Libya\. In a final bid for freedom, they board crowded, flimsy rafts and dangerous vessels that leave into Mediterranean waters\. The stories SAR workers and volunteers hear [on board the Aquarius](https://www.newsdeeply.com/refugees/community/2018/11/19/what-it-means-for-migrants-when-europe-blocks-sea-rescues) highlight how people are repeatedly stripped of their humanity and dignity\.

Unlike the general attitude and perception of Europeans, who are mostly poorly informed on the real situation regarding refugee resettlement today, it is the generally poorer and geographically closer countries that take in most people in need of international protection\. It is a fact that **while two\-thirds of international migrants are destined for high income countries, 9 out of 10 refugees are hosted by low\- and middle\-income countries,** which require support from international partners, but are we aware of that?

**Somalia** is at the heart of one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world today\. Twenty years of conflict and waves of drought have uprooted a quarter of the country’s 7\.5 million people, sadly moving from a tent to a shelter…and never to a house, as one Somali architect noted\.

International organizations document that inside **South Sudan** , nearly two million people are displaced internally, while outside the country there are now over two million South Sudanese refugees, mainly in Ethiopia, Sudan, and Uganda\. As in other cases, refugees often arrive in underserved areas of host countries, so those arriving in Uganda settle in the poor West Nile subregion\. Uganda currently hosts the most South Sudanese refugees, having taken in more than one million\. 
Many fear imminent attack or struggle with food insecurity\.


![The situation in South Sudan and neighbouring countries has quickly escalated into a full\-blown humanitarian emergency\. The majority of the refugees are women and children, many of whom flee across the border alone\. Often, they arrive weak and malnourished\. When the rainy season comes, their needs are compounded by flooding, food shortages and disease\. — data from the UN Operational portal on refugee situations](assets/1888b555cfab/1*4wKdt-0gYLGG7qxtQP77ig.jpeg)

When the rainy season comes, their needs are compounded by flooding, food shortages and disease\. — data from the UN Operational portal on refugee situations

Total number of refugees and asylum\-seekers from the **Democratic Republic of the Congo** is 781,917, while 1\.37 million Congolese are internally displaced\. Many Congolese were working in the informal mining sector, in the northeast of Angola, before being asked to leave\. A recent expulsion order by the authorities in Angola targeting migrants has [reportedly](http://www.unhcr.org/news/briefing/2018/10/5bc59dcb4/mass-congolese-returns-angola-lead-humanitarian-crisis.html) caused thousands to be stuck at near the border, with limited means to travel onwards to their homes\. There are reports of violence, including sexual violence and harassment, bodily frisking and theft of belongings, at the hands of security forces on both sides of the border\.


> The Congolese refugee population is now among the ten largest in the world\. Nearly 55 per cent are children, many crossing borders unaccompanied or separated\. 




It is difficult and close to impossible to display real data as many lives are lost and people suffer ‘under the radar’ of the official registries and statistics\. 
However, **Burundi** Regional Refugee Response Plan includes Burundian refugees who fled since April 2015, and its [Regional Overview of the Burundian Refugee Population \(as of 31 October 2018\)](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/documents/details/66910) notes that there are some 13,000 Burundian refugees and asylum seekers in Kenya, 8,700 in Mozambique, 7,700 in Malawi, 8,900 in South Africa and 4,900 in Zambia who are assisted within the respective country\-level programmes\. A further 23,000 Burundian refugees, who have lived for decades in Tanzania, no longer receive assistance and are not included in these figures\.

Thousands have died and a fifth of **Central African Republic** ’s 4\.5 million population have fled their homes in a conflict that broke out after mainly Muslim Seleka rebels ousted President Francois Bozize in 2013, provoking a backlash from Christian anti\-balaka militias\. According to [OCHA](https://reliefweb.int/updates?search=%28primary_country.iso3%3A%22caf%22%29%20AND%20ocha_product%3A%22Situation%20Report%22%20AND%20source%3A%22UN%20Office%20for%20the%20Coordination%20of%20Humanitarian%20Affairs%22) , 50 per cent of the population having to rely on humanitarian assistance to survive, while 25 per cent is displaced either internally or in a neighbouring country\.

Following violence, hostilities, human rights violations and a rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation in the northern part of [**Mali**](https://www.unocha.org/mali) since January 2012, large numbers of Malians have been seeking refuge in Burkina Faso, Mauritania and Niger, or are displaced internally\.

In **[Ethiopia](https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/DTM%20Ethiopia%20National%20Dashboard%20Round%2013%20DRAFT.pdf)** , nearly 1\.1 million people are displaced in the Somali region overall, when other causes such as drought and flood are included\. With the 200,000 people who fled ethnic conflict to camps in the Somali region of the country in the past 4 months, over 700,000 people [reportedly](https://reliefweb.int/report/ethiopia/700000-people-flee-conflict-seek-safety-somali-region-ethiopia) fled inter\-communal violence in recent years\.

Biljeljina Police also said that on Monday it has discovered a group of 14 “undocumented illegal migrants” in the city and that the police determined they are Pakistani nationals\. Last Friday, police in Samac discovered eight undocumented people and determined that they are Iranian citizens\. They have been transferred to Doboj police field team, Bijeljina Police Office spokesperson told local media\. “We have noticed the reappearance of Iranian migrants,” Bijeljina City Manager said\. Serbia recently canceled the visa\-free regime with Iran, resulting in “partial reduction” of the arrivals of migrants from that country, “but this morning again, the majority of arrivals were from Iran,” Bijeljina Manager added\. At a meeting of the migration coordinating body, Republic Srpska entity President and Prime Minister said that additional police forces will be deployed to tackle the illegal migration issue, but according to Bijeljina City Manager, the national “institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina need to react better and faster”\.

#### LIBYA/SEA

Libyan forces violently removed the migrants aboard [N](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/nivin?source=feed_text) ivin today, Tuesday 20\. They reportedly shot rubber bullets at the migrants, injuring 10 people\. Some were hospitalised, while other people were taken from the Nivin to the al\-Karareem detention center\. The action was reportedly led by the Libyan Ministry of Interior since they decided to define the migrants on board as criminals\. Humanitarian organisations weren’t allowed access to the area as this happened, as the instructions given were reportedly these:


> \- interrogate all detainees to the Public Prosecutor’s Office\.
 

> \- Transferring injured and sick to emergency hospital for treatment\.
 

> \- Prevent international organizations from reaching migrants

#### SEA SEARCH AND RESCUE

The last privately\-operated ship conducting rescue missions in the Mediterranean, Aquarius, was ordered to be seized by the prosecutors in Catania\. They are allegedly accused of illegal disposal of 24,000kg of waste, included clothing worn by migrants, blood\-stained bandages, and medical waste\.

“We categorically refuse accusations of involvement in illegal activities\. Standard procedures, that have not been questioned by authorities so far, have always been followed by the Aquarius\.

Faced with another politically driven attack, we expect the French authorities to show restraint in the implementation of this decision, as the Aquarius is currently docked in the port of Marseille\. In these difficult moments for the Aquarius, in which repeated political pressure forced our two organizations to temporally cease search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean, we are fully aligned and support all MSF efforts to appeal the court’s decision\.”

![“In my culture we work at 14\. It’s normal to us\. So working hard and being strong is what I am used to\. But here, not only can I not work, not only do I have to shower outside under a tap when I’m lucky\. Here it is as though I am not human\.
 Now I know I am human, but this situation makes me feel as though I am not\. Not being able to sleep properly, being moved from place to place\. We are isolated here\. Unable to hold on to items that keep us warm, unable to find shelter, security\. This morning we were woken up; items gone, hope fleeting\. The nights are colder and the situation is worse\.
 I know I am human and I thought I was strong, but now I am not so sure after being here\.”
 These are the words of a Kurdish refugee currently living, like so many others, in the patchy scrub\-land that we visit near to Dunkirk\. Although his situation is bleak, he still makes time, every week, to talk to us and even say thank you for the basic aid that we deliver\. — [Care4Calais](https://www.facebook.com/care4calais/?tn-str=k%2AF)](assets/1888b555cfab/1*-Oc1IJ1rF5RAlBpwIS744w.jpeg)

### Are returns to Syria an option somewhere behind closed doors?

[Mobile Info Team](https://www.facebook.com/mobileinfoteam/?__tn__=%2CdkCH-R-R&eid=ARCfFcK_95VVDM3nbZis025dRVOx_s9LXkLBufwcy_ROSLv8GnHk433Rlfm9ZtvdWL5R3IXAFZXFMmZY&hc_ref=ARSzBG63CeIn8BOyBruN5cAU97pTKSWIxI9-rUr9wgcrJpq_FIQY3vyQwmEIreh_7GM&fref=nf&hc_location=group) reports: As the Assad regime has regained control of large parts of Syria, politicians are starting to think about the possibility of gradually returning Syrian nationals\. For example, some days ago a German politician stated that deportation cases to Syria should be looked into at least for persons who present a potential threat\. Despite this viewpoint, an internal report by the German foreign ministry highlights how Syria is still considered unsafe; this report is confidential but was leaked to a German newspaper\. It describes the multiple risks potential deportees to Syria would face\. Young men will on return be called for their military service and will often be placed on the front line\. The report also mentions that it has been said that several returnees were questioned and detained by the security services, while others have been permanently disappeared\. Police and security agencies are systematically using torture, especially on people known to be part of the opposition\. The report also stresses that medical treatment is often insufficient and the economy of the country has collapsed, so it is very difficult to maintain a proper living situation\.

#### DENMARK

The first demonstration in the fight to reform deportation camp Sjælsmark happened today, where people heard about the deplorable conditions of the camp from adult and children’s voices alike\. The message was clear:
