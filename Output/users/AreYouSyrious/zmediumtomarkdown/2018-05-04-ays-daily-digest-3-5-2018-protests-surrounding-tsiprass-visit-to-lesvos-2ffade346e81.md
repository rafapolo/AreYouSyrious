### FEATURE

In the context of Greek PM Alexis Tsipras’s visit to Lesvos, many groups have turned out to protest with various grievances, primarily directed against Greek reception centres on Lesvos\. Police fired tear gas into a group of protestors attempting to overturn a police bus\.

A general strike occurred on Thursday in various communities on Lesvos in order to protest against the repercussions of the EU\-Turkey deal\. The primary motive behind the protest was to express anger and upset at how the reception of people on the move has impacted, in the eyes of the protestors, the local community\. The danger of some factions of this group of protestors was made evident last night as many ran through town, attacking buildings\.

As covered in [yesterday’s digest](ays-daily-digest-2-5-18-more-than-3000-new-arrivals-in-greece-in-april-3684b8483114) , the Greek government has made promises to reduce the number of people in camps on the islands by the end of September, but it remains a challenge to see how that would be executed\.

Many residents of the camps, of course, would much rather be on the mainland, but it is worrisome that after years of publicity over the overcrowding and inhumane conditions in Moria and other camps, the primary narrative remains focused on how this has impacted citizens of Lesvos, tacitly endorsing a “refugees versus locals” mentality that distracts from the larger powers whose responsibility it is to protect the rights and humanity of all\.

Why do the authorities take so little action to protect those most vulnerable — under pressure from both the local community and trapped in a system that won’t let them out? This is an additional layer of inhumane treatment of people on the island\.

### SEA

According to Sea Watch near Malta, the sea is very bad these days, making crossing with smaller boats extremely dangerous to nearly impossible\. They, however, continue to watch for people caught at sea in these conditions\.
#### Maydayterreano asking for funding

Maydayterreano is looking to raise funding so it can continue SAR operations\. 100 people died in the sea in April, and with weather conditions improving, more may be looking to cross\. The crew is based in Spain\.

_“We need to put our ship as soon as possible at sea: [http://www\.maydayterraneo\.org/apoya/](http://www.maydayterraneo.org/apoya/) ”_
### GREECE
#### Arrivals

In spite of the protests, the world turns away\. A total of 157 people landed on the Greek islands yesterday, according to the Aegean Boat Report: 110 people on Lesvos and 47 on Chios\. For a detailed breakdown, go [here](https://www.facebook.com/AegeanBoatReport/posts/340654926457618) \.

Additionally, a boat with 53 people ran aground in northern Greece\. The people on the boat which ran aground on Molyvoti beach are believed to be from Syria and Iraq\. It is unclear what happened to the people as of yet\.

#### Lesvos shoreline trash pickup project

Refugee4Refugees has started a lovely new project focusing on shoreline trash pickup on parts of Lesvos\. In order to fairly support volunteers \(who are residents of camps themselves\), they need funding for the project\. Go [here](https://www.gofundme.com/refugees4lesvos) to learn more\!

Mobile Info Team posted a helpful translated guide giving pointers on what to do if one has lost an Asylum Seeker White Card\. For the full text in multiple languages go [here](https://www.facebook.com/mobileinfoteam/posts/2164581573770560:0?hc_location=ufi) \. An important distinction to make is the following however: “This is only possible with a white card issued at your full registration interview\. _THE WHITE CARD ISSUED AT THE PRE\-REGISTRATION IS NOT REPLACEABLE\.”_

Pssst: Mobile Info Team also needs a long term coordinator with fundraising experience\!

#### Guide for kindergarten enrolment

Although everyone with a child within the age range \(all born in 2013 and, in 184 municipalities, children born in 2014\) must enroll \(the deadline is May 18th\), enrolling does not guarantee one’s child a place\. For full instructions, go [here](https://www.refugee.info/greece/education--greece/kindergarten-for-5-year-old-refugees) \.

### GENERAL

_UNHCR and partners received increased reports of collective expulsions, including of 320 asylum\-seekers from Croatia \(compared to 167 the preceding two weeks\), 124 from Hungary \(compared to 156 the preceding two weeks\) and 23 from Romania \(compared to 12 the preceding two weeks\), while 22 persons reported to have been pushed\-back from Bosnia and Herzegovina\._

According to a [document](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/documents/details/63435) published by UNHCR:

_Some 33,000 children arrived in Greece, Italy, Bulgaria and Spain in 2017\. Although this is an almost 70% decrease compared to 2016, in 2017 the proportion of children arriving unaccompanied or separated \(UASC\) has increased by 31%_
### FRANCE
#### Dismal conditions in French detention centres

The organization Anafé in France continue to report on horrific conditions facing Afghan asylum\-seekers in detention centres in airports\. There have been at least three miscarriages in the last six months at the Roissy airport waiting zones, and Anafé has registered 29 allegations of police pressure or violence in 2016\. Most recently, “several Afghan asylum\-seekers have spent five days in the Beauvais airport retention centre in “inhuman and degrading conditions\.”

Anafé describes “stifling heat” and overflowing garbage, no hygiene items for the four first days, a lack of proper food, and no way of contacting their family or a lawyer\.

A woman is five months pregnant and during her stay she suffered from stomach pain and bleeding\. During the last four days, the couple had no explanation of their rights\. The authorities refused to register their demand for asylum and tried send them back illegally two times to Greece\.

It’s only with Anafé’s support that they were able to register their asylum demand and leave the centre after five days\.”

### GERMANY

Police in Ellwang stormed a refugee centre after they were prevented from carrying out the deportation of a man from Togo\.


> More than a hundred inhabitants of a refugee shelter in Ellwangen are said to have prevented the deportation of a Togolese man by force\. Now the police have taken several men into custody\. 





> Three days after the failed deportation of a 23\-year\-old Togolese man, another police operation has been underway since Thursday morning in a refugee accommodation in Ellwangen in Baden\-Württemberg\. A spokesman for the Aalen police headquarters said so\. “The operation is underway,” according to a police statement\. 





> It is unclear whether the officials wanted to meet the African, who was initially in hiding there\. The police did not give any further details in the morning\. Local observers spoke of a large police force around the former Bundeswehr site\. 





> The officials arrived with several vehicles\. The streets around the accommodation were closed off over a wide area\. In addition, the police were on standby with additional forces\. Officials in protective clothing were on display\. Paramedics and emergency doctors were also on site\. 





> Several men were taken into custody in the lodging, as witnesses observed\. Later at least one man was taken to another place in a prisoner transporter\. Whether this was the 23\-year\-old man from Togo was not announced by the police\. 





This in the context of CDU politicians arguing for a tougher line against asylum seekers, blaming them for “crossing red lines\.”
