#### FEATURED ‚Äî State of Emergency declared in Lithuania

Media [report](https://www.baltictimes.com/lithuania_declares_state_of_emergency_at_belarusian_border_as_of_midnight/) that Lithuanian parliament voted in favour \(122 to 1\) of the declaration of a state of emergency along the border with Belarus and five km inland, as well as in the migrant accommodation facilities in Kybartai, Medininkai, Pabrade, Rukla and Vilnius\. The state of emergency will last for one month starting Wednesday, 10 November\. New measures are introduced:


> \- the movement of vehicles in the border area without border guards‚Äô permission will be restricted, 
 

> \- entry into this territory will be banned, except for local residents having necessary evidence,
 

> \- authorities will have the right to check vehicles and persons, their belongings,
 

> \- gatherings will be banned,
 

> \- people on the move who are accommodated in the country‚Äôs reception facilities will see their right to communicate in writing or by telephone restricted, except for the possibility to contact authorities\. 





Moreover the state of emergency [allows](https://twitter.com/DunyaCollective/status/1458461444383682562) border guards to use ‚Äúmental coercion‚Äù and ‚Äúproportionate physical violence‚Äù to prevent people on the move from crossing the border, i\.e\. carrying out push\-backs, as it has already been admitted by Lithuanian border guards, or in the euphemism of the country‚Äôs Foreign Minister, ‚Äú [re\-routing](https://twitter.com/ACatInParis/status/1458234983957532674) ‚Äù people‚Ä¶

In the blame game between Eastern EU border countries and Belarus, people on the move are those who constantly lose\. The Lithuanian foreign minister admitted to planning to use aggressive border measures against people who ‚Äî [in his words](https://twitter.com/ACatInParis/status/1458234983957532674) ‚Äî are chased with dogs by Belarusian authorities to push them to cross the border\.

- [**EU: The ‚Äòweaponised migration‚Äô discourse dehumanises asylum\-seekers**](https://www.statewatch.org/news/2021/november/eu-the-weaponised-migration-discourse-dehumanises-asylum-seekers/) ‚Äî _Following the arrival of a substantial number of people in Poland and Lithuania after having crossed the border from Belarus, the EU and its member states have accused the regime of Alexander Lukashenko of ‚Äúweaponising migration‚Äù ‚Äî a discourse that legitimises the treatment of asylum\-seekers ‚Äúas other than human‚Äù\._

#### One more death at the border

According to [local reports](https://oko.press/14-letni-kurd-zmarl-z-wyziebienia-pod-kuznica-wiadomosc-z-obozu-migrantow/) , a 14\-year\-old died of hypothermia in the large makeshift camp on the Belarusian side of the border with Poland, near Ku≈∫nica\. Belarusian authorities took the body to the local hospital\.

GREECE
#### Press Freedom in Greece?

[IPI\-The Global Network for Independent Journalism](https://twitter.com/globalfreemedia/status/1458431354274713606) have condemned the attack by the Greek PM on journalist Ingeborg Beugel\. [Mapping Media Freedom](https://mappingmediafreedom.ushahidi.io/posts/24369) list the methods which have been used to discredit her:


> Following her pointed questions at a press conference with the Greek PM, she was targeted online, insulted and accused of spreading Turkish propaganda\. Beugel was also the focus of attempts to discredit her by numerous pro government media and journalists in Greece, including some comments which accused her of lying, spreading propaganda and being a ‚Äúpro\-Turkish‚Äù agent\. Other reports delved into her personal life in an attempt to discredit her\.
