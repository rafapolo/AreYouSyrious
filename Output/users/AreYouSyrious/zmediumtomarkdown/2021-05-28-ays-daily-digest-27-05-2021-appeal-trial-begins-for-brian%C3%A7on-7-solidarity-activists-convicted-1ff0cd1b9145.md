### FEATURE — Appeal Process Underway in Grenoble for ‘Briançon 7’

In [yesterday’s digest](ays-daily-digest-26-05-2021-four-acquitted-of-human-trafficking-charges-for-showing-solidarity-2da42a2c39d7) we reported the happy news that four individuals, including two journalists, were acquited in a Brussels appeals court of human trafficking charges after they sheltered people\-on\-the\-move in their homes\.

Yesterday, May 27, another appeal trial involving the ‘criminalization of solidarity’ began in Grenoble, France, for the so\-called ‘Briançon 7’, a group of individuals who were convicted of “facilitating the irregular entry of foreign nationals” into France in December 2018\.

[The story of ‘Briançon 7’](https://www.france24.com/en/20180531-france-immigration-foreign-activists-trial-helping-migrants-enter-country-alps) begins in the spring of 2018\. On April 22, the seven human rights defenders gathered along the French\-Italian border, near the commune of Briançon\. The group included four French nationals, Jean\-Luc Jalmain, Benoit Ducos, Lisa Malapert and Briançon resident Mathieu Burellier, and three foreign nationals, Italian Eleonora Laterza, Swiss Bastian Stauffer and Swiss\-Belgian Theo Buckmaster\.

The group’s aim was to show solidarity with people\-on\-the\-move making the dangerous crossing from Italy into France\. The seven participated in a peaceful demonstration, in which they marched from ski town of Clavière in Italy towards France, crossing the border into the French town of Briançon\.

Traveling with them were some twenty people\-on\-the\-move, whom they escorted along the treacherous mountain pass\. The activists were responding to a blockade set up at a nearby mountain pass by several dozen far\-right activists from Generation Identitaire \(Identity Generation\), who were trying to prevent the entry of the people\-on\-the\-move into France\.

“The march was organised as a peaceful response to the actions of anti\-migrant groups and the militarisation of the Franco\-Italian border, which has pushed migrants to attempt to enter France through mountain passes without suitable equipment or the requisite knowledge, thus putting them at risk,” [Front Line Defenders](https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/case/seven-migrant-rights-defenders-sentenced) wrote following the activists’ convictions\.

The group of seven were arrested after the demonstration and convicted in the Criminal Court of Gap on December 13, 2018 of “facilitating the irregular entry of foreign nationals”\. Mathieu Burellier and Jean\-Luc Jalmain were sentenced to twelve months’ imprisonment, eight of which were suspended, due to previous convictions\. The five others received a suspended sentence of six months\.

Front Line Defenders said the ruling “criminalises their \[the activists’\] peaceful and legitimate work for the protection of migrants rights and endangers the work of migrants rights defenders in France\.”

Now, two and a half years after the conviction, the appeal trial for the Briançon 7 is finally underway in the French city of Grenoble\.

Amnesty International wrote in a press release this week that the organization “considers that the conviction of the Briançon 7 for facilitation of irregular entry must be quashed, as it contravenes the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly\.”

Additionally, a petition has been launched to draw attention to the criminalization of solidarity\. \(You can sign the petition [here](https://www.change.org/p/pr%C3%A9sident-de-la-r%C3%A9publique-fran%C3%A7aise-unite-and-support-the-3-4-2) \. \)

The petition reads, in part:


> For 5 years, French Government has been hunting down those it considers undesirable, carrying out daily illegal deportations in violation of its own laws\. 





> For 5 years, thousands of solidarity workers and dozens of caregivers have been taking turns in the name of the principle of fraternity to assist exiles coming to our country in the hope for a little peace\[…\] 





> For us, SOLIDARITY CITIZENS, repeating tirelessly this deadly scenario at the Briançon’s border is not acceptable\. 





> The militarization of our mountains is a French State vain gesture leading people in exile to take more and more risks\. 





> Let’s make these trials a new opportunity to highlight repression, injustice and the invisibilized violence exercised every day on people in exile\. 





> “The people who die on the beaches, if they were white, the whole world would be moved” Fatou Diome\. 





> We call on citizens, associations, institutions, elected officials and communities to support our fight for solidarity and, at last, to stop the prosecution of volunteers, associations and defenders of rights\.

### NGOs under fire in Greece

Refugee Support Aegean \(RSA\) published an interesting report examining the increasing scurinty under which NGOs operating in Greece are put\.

“Risks of repression of civil society organisations supporting refugees and migrants in Greece have been heavily exacerbated by successive legislative reforms in 2020, introducing disproportionate and ambiguous requirements for registration on two Registries managed by the Ministry of Migration and Asylum”, RSA wrote\.

The report includes a detailed timeline of the restrictions imposed on Greece’s NGO registry\.

I was raped at the age of ten years, married to the man who raped me to safe the honour of my familiy, but got devorced quickly and returned to my father’s house\.

### Parliament says Syria not safe for deportations

The Dutch Parliament this week rejected to follow in the footsteps of Denmark in deporting recognized refugees back to Syria, [media reported](https://syrianobserver.com/news/66343/dutch-parliament-refuses-to-deport-refugees.html?fbclid=IwAR3DlmRjcsd_HKfMJY_F_ekaJNc2nSBF2rv2G7tppebImrwV9XPgti3hy9I) \.

Lawmakers gathered on May 25 to discuss the security situation in Syria\. Far\-right parties voiced proposals to declare Syria, or regions of the country, as ‘safe areas’, a move which would allow for deportations\.

The right\-wing parties proposed to to suspend permanent residencies issued to Syrian refugees after five years; send a Dutch delegation to arrange the repatriation of Syrian refugees with the Damascus government; and work in tandem with Denmark in that country’s plans to repatriate Syrians\. Last year, the Netherlands re\-confirmed Syria as an unsafe country, according to media\.

The Parliament, however, rejected these proposals this week\. Lawmakers agreed to commission a study of the challenges to the integration of refugees in the Netherlands\.

### Foreign Affairs Ministry condemns Syria election

While Denmark is actively trying to deport refugees back to Syria, its Foreign Affairs Minister wrote on Twitter yesterday that the recent presidential elections in Syria were “neither free nor fair”, but “a coronation”\. Seems like Denmark shouldn’t deport refugees back to a country without free elections—not even mentioning that parts of Syria are still active war zones\.
