### Greece

A man who tried to prevent a boat from capsizing has been sentenced to 146 years in prion by the court on Lesvos for smuggling and endangering people’s lives, [according](https://www.borderline-europe.de/unsere-arbeit/lesbos-mohamad-h-zu-146-jahren-haft-verurteilt?l=en) to Borderline Europe\. The man said in court that he did not know steeering a wheel is considered a crime under Greek law, to which the judge asked: “How is it possible you did not know that what you were doing was illegal? Then why you did not come to Greece with a ferry or by buying a ticket?” The defense wants to file an appeal\.

Informal education activities have had to be suspended, the warmer weather has brought more insects inside the tents, and the food situation is still far from good\. “People are completely exhausted, and they are feeling very hopeless\. The promise we were given from Greek politicians and the EU was that there would be “no more Morias”, but everything is repeating itself”, the Moria groups criticize\. They further demand NGOs to take Covid\-19 prevention seriously and to spread the word about the risks of the virus and prevention measures\.

More than 150 people have been evicted from the Nursing Home, a squat in the center of Bihac\. [According](https://www.facebook.com/NoNameKitchenBelgrade/posts/1239871336411148) to No Name Kitchen, those evicted have been transferred to Lipa camp\. “However, when the people landed in the above mentioned Lipa camp \(for the moment controlled by local authorities\) they were rejected at the Lipa camp doors by security personnel, despite being moved there by the authorities themselves,” NNK continues\. As the people were not able to take their belongings with them, they expect more requests the next days\. Some people were already found in the mountains around the camp with nowhere to go\.
