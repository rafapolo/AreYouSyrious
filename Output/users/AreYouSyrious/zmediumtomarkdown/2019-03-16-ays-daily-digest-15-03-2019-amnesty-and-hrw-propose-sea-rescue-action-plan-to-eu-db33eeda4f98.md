In the wake of EU Ports being blocked, search and rescue vessels being denied access to operate, human rights abuses continuing by the Libyan Coast Guard, and the corrupt externalisation of Europe’s borders to North African Countries — which are unable to cope with increased migratory pressure or provide necessary protection to those seeking asylum — viable and humane solutions are desperately needed if we are to lower the deaths occurring in the Mediterranean Sea\.

As 45 more lives were claimed to the Western Mediterranean in a shipwreck off the coast of Morocco Yesterday, [the death toll has now reached 234 persons already this year\.](http://missingmigrants.iom.int/region/mediterranean) The ship was on route to Spain, which has overtaken both Greece and Italy as a main entry port for people on the move\. Over 55,000 people arrived in Spain by sea in 2018, according to UNHCR\.

While organisations continue to demand that rescuing lives is not a crime across Europe, EU authorities continue to prevent organisations from undergoing SAR operations\. If sea rescue organisations are given an opportunity to rescue anyone, the vessels which include very vulnerable people — many of whom have survived torture in Libya — are often forced to remain on the sea for days while EU member states ping pong the responsibility to one another\.

Consequently, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have sent an action plan to the European Council detailing 20 steps that offer a fair and predictable rescue system in the Mediterranean in order to put an end to deaths at sea and in detention\.

[The action plan is separated into four distinct actions](http://statewatch.org/news/2019/mar/eu-med-amnesty-hrw-action-plan.htm) which are summarized below\.
1. **Establish a temporary mechanism for predictable disembarkation and relocation**


The steps involved in this action include a system of cooperation between EU member states that are to provide temporary arrangements of disembarkation and then the prompt relocation of people rescued at sea to different European countries in an equitable way where allocation share is based on objective criteria\. They state that people should not be discriminated against according to nationality by EU states; rather, when they reach their designated European country, they should undergo a normal asylum procedure there\. They also propose that nobody rescued should be detained\.

**2\. Ensure proactive search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean**

The steps involved in this action outline that the EU institutions and member states should assist with and ensure robust search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean\. This includes ensuring there are enough SAR vessels deployed, that vessels involved in rescues are not penalized for assisting with rescue operations but instead promptly provided with a safe disembarkation point, that NGOs are permitted to work and save lives in an enabling environment, and that cooperation with the Libyan Coast Guard is limited and people are not sent back to Libya\.

**3\. Protect migrants and refugees’ rights in migration\-related cooperation with Libya**

Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch call for the hasty release of all people arbitrarily detained in Libya and an end to the system of automatic and indefinite detention in the country\. Additionally, they contend for UNHCR’s full access to people on the move in Libya and the employment of independent monitoring systems for human rights abuses occurring in Libya\.

**4\. Commit to global responsibility sharing and facilitating regular migration pathways**


> In accordance with the 2016 Global Strategy for the EU’s Foreign and Security Policy, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch call on EU states and institutions to: 





> _20\. Step up efforts to implement and increase resettlement pledges and open alternative pathways to protection to people in need of international protection — including for the thousands stranded in Libya — and commit to reviewing migration policies with a view to facilitate regular pathways for would\-be migrants\._ 




#### LIBYA

Amnesty International Research, Matteo De Bellis, [explains some aspects of the situation in Libya\.](https://twitter.com/matteodebellis/status/1106552511941484545)


> **Are abuses occurring in official centers?** 
 

> Abuses are extensively documented in both\. All people are held arbitrarily, without legal redress\. Frequent abuses: torture, beatings, murders, rape, exploitation\. Conditions are inhumane\. 





> **How many people are held in official centers?** 
 

> Official Centers: 5000 women, men and children\-mostly people intercepted by the Libyan Coastguard and deported back\.
 

> Unofficial Centers: No one knows\. 





> **What can Italy do?** 
 

> Italy can use its influence on the Libyan authorities to secure the closure of the detention centers \[instating\] this as a condition without which Italy is not prepared to continue the cooperation with Libya\. 





> **And what is it that Italy cannot do?** 
 

> What it is doing \[now\]: helping the Libyan coast Guard stop people at sea and bring them back to detention centers, knowing that they will be held illegally and tortured\. The law says, v\. Art\. 16, 





> But, “help them to their home?”
 

> A slogan to sweep the dust under the rug\. Only the dust are PEOPLE\. If we want to “help,” let’s start by offering resettlement to refugees who are closed in detention centers, \[because without\]a home, they don’t have anywhere to return to\. 




#### SEA:

Sea\-Watch reconnaissance aircraft Moon Bird is back patrolling SAR zones after a recent break for maintenance\. They report that the Moon Bird is the only operational asset as no rescue ships are currently present\.

Calls to Free Open Arms resumes work after being prevented from saving lives in Central Mediterranean for two months\.

#### GREECE
#### Islands

Two boats have arrived on the Greek Islands today, the first boat carrying 48 people arrived on Samos, while the second boat carrying 45 people arrived on Lesvos\.

The Education Ministry’s regional director for the Northern Aegean will attempt to dissuade local parents from continuing to prohibit refugee children stuck on Samos from attending local school\. The parents maintain the view that allowing refugee children to attend the school poses a ‘health hazard\.’

The Education ministry has responded to the incident by saying, “A small number of parents have for the past two weeks tried to cultivate a climate of racism and xenophobia\.”
#### Mainland:

DOCTORS URGENTLY NEEDED\!
Doctors are urgently needed to cover the next two weeks in Thessaloniki by [Medical Volunteers International e\.V\.](https://www.facebook.com/medicalvolunteersinternational/?__tn__=kC-R&eid=ARCfvsNaNLbSuhcM0FxkToT8--ULZqUWbAMXgvszki2imsDh_dHeW5Bu8WKf4rG-Y1XJEZ1XGcXfRvwB&hc_ref=ARTZm1210wsNGnrCvFdDdlYY4tGsN_wR1-kge9uuj5qAmQfIDmMTbCPMGevk2CFkJVA&fref=nf&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARBEuETxQpf6h2CYzqb4Clyn2abNXYL6K-xNqc9GiuJw6BZjPU1Rx_g3nH_3qJdhdUSS0_RLnO-lN6_f9SMTFPfSN1EWc17AzoAAGkibcKSNoBg3olZQ-LuCaXeTQ-P5UvnuIaV0aBqDDKvi47TD5MxdbXY_MCwHkxEVidNvsnx8w08-IJNVT8fF_9MwxyqwP6XDM4F_QnFpulZvUjLvq6MO8BMhhfIWV52CPoC0mhhdG5QXi2B7aDKTjaFA_uzsIb_RDoW1g5ln-gAhlmCNgFZPE0nwvbgToqJv6vxIym1mge_KnbihzGSmwdCCTFGQDAgZ564LwKiSuvQaUbs2hH4)

Dråpen i Havet report that Skaramangas camp has received 500 new arrivals from the islands in the last 24 hours\. SOSRefugiados warns that in Malkassa camp, which lacks infrastructure or assistance from large NGOs, new families continue to arrive\.

A racist attack has occurred in Vilia Attica in Athens against refugees who were transferred just two hours before the incident from Vial on Chios to a hotel there\. Alarm phone reports that the racists entered the rooms of the hotel where people were relocated, and then attacked using petrol bombs, stones, and batons\. The attack came after the far\-right mayor responded to the move by calling for locals to protest their presence\.


> **City Plaza has released a statement on the incident:** 
 

> The situation went out of the control and racist men flocked to the hotel, breaking doors and windows and attacking the hotel’s guests\. One person has been hit\. While at the moment the far\-right racists have been removed, the terror \[of another attack\] is there\. The refugees are trapped inside the hotel\. 




#### SPAIN

Calls from Amnesty International to expedite procedures in order to allow two search and rescue vessels, Proactiva Open Arms and Aita Mari, to set sail and continue saving lives as soon as possible\. The ships have been blocked for two months by Spanish authorities for seemingly fabricated reasons\.


> **The director of Amnesty International Spain has said:** 
 

> The bureaucratic obstacles that have denied the departure of both ships prevent organizations from carrying out activities that have been essential to protect the lives of thousands of people fleeing war and persecution to find a safe place\. The most direct consequence is that at this time many deaths could be avoided, and the solution is clear: to allow the departure of these ships and remember that saving lives is not a crime\. 




#### ITALY

[Far Right Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/15732/italy-delivers-50-off-road-vehicles-to-fight-irregular-migration-in-tunisia?fbclid=IwAR3qF80aiG-G5zwfWu6jWC53k154O1u8Ixwwx0NVTEgmedlbg4xirfPcq2A) takes pride in Italy’s cementing cooperation with Tunisia\. Italy has come through on a promise to donate 50 new off\-road vehicles to the country in order to help fight irregular migration\.


> **Matteo Salvini states:** 





> \[This was\] made possible thanks to financing from the foreign ministry’s Africa Fund, and is part of a framework of fruitful operational and security collaboration between the governments of Italy and Tunisia\. 





If the cooperation between Italy and Tunisia begins to resemble something similar to Italy’s cooperation with Libya — there is cause for concern\.
#### FRANCE

[Five organisations have come together to denounce](https://www.lejdd.fr/Societe/tribune-sauver-des-vies-nest-pas-un-delit-dans-les-montagnes-comme-ailleurs-3870746?fbclid=IwAR2gcgo4vTMXcGRgOuB007MNiLLzn0lFtVn5G5VDViYDn3KZ6Vc0AEG9Mto) and protest the criminalisation of those providing aid by French Authorities at the French\-Italian Border, which poses a serious danger to those crossing due to the mountainous terrain\.


> We are here to show our solidarity with the solidarity citizens, to denounce the practices of the illegal, unjust and unworthy police forces” — **MDM \(Doctors of the World\) France** 





Organisations include Amnesty International, Cimade, Doctors of the World, Médecins sans Frontières and Secours Catholique\.


> **Michel Rousseau reports:** 
 

> The situation is worsening because the border is increasingly monitored\. The police patrol every night and force the migrants back to Italy without even being able to claim their right to seek asylum\. As a result, exiles take more and more risks to escape\. By helping them, we do not feel at all disobedient, on the contrary: we place ourselves in conformity with the values ​​of our Republic\. 




#### UK

[High court orders that the “no warning” tactic](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-47577266?SThisFB&fbclid=IwAR3dKK0ZBDYo5sliLCoju4C0cRKzBTi95FhDTeZxybjCjZoEYosSpSPFGv8) employed by immigration authorities are immediately stopped, cancelling 69 planned immigration removals\. This order is a result of an organisation that defends detainees illuminating how these removals breach the right of detainees to access justice\. Thousands of people across the UK are subject to these unlawful policies each year\.


> Medical Justice said the policy prevented immigrants having a fair chance to put their case before they were put on a plane out of the country\. It said the policy had affected a huge range of people living in the UK\. 





**Alarmingly it has been uncovered that ‘Aspen Debit Cards,’ which provide asylum seekers in the UK with 37\.75 pounds per week, have been used to track their movements\.** 
Allegedly, many desperate families have been denied the money they are entitled to for leaving their ‘authorized’ city\. Furthermore, in the UK, asylum seekers are only allowed to work in occupations that are listed on the UK’s shortage occupation list\. These jobs are in extremely specialized fields, such as ballet dancers\.
