### Libya

The Ministry of Interior appears to have begun closing three refugee detention centers this week\. The detention centers in question are Tabour, Khoms, and Misrata\. This news was first reported by the [The Libya Observer](https://www.facebook.com/lyobserver/?__tn__=%2CdkCH-R-R&eid=ARBNKF-OYcjwgbOMoEue1Gf3sRI5k_w7bUJHJv9ODUCpHKYhdHMgUWuIvrHj6xMzzWdr9rGSoNeOemNe&hc_ref=ARSGN2tIHVg8UzG4Q2DmUiX7wh_OSWIWE3hodNOQt6ptAV1Qu5RlD39vOGwC0DkCGGg&fref=nf&hc_location=group) outlet\. The story seems to be confirmed by a leaked letter written by GNA Interior Minister Bashaga ordering the closure of the centers and the deportation of the people held here\.

These Libyan prisons are notorious for their barbaric conditions, where refugees are often forced into labor, extorted, or sold\. Despite pressure from international and civil organizations, Italy and the EU have continued to cooperate with and fund the governments running these centers\. Just today, a group of international NGO’s [released a public letter](https://twitter.com/Intersos/status/1156954130189094912?fbclid=IwAR0Sfpzt2dHgDV8U-mRqFf-ikavyDFXnARiqFCYjrbXz4poiykwm2m3y5Bs) calling for the immediate closure of these detention centers\.

However, their closure is not the outcome rights advocates have been fighting for; the stated plan of the Libyan authorities is to deport all of these refugees back to their countries of origin\. While these refugees may be released from the hellish Libyan prisons, they are not necessarily finding safety if being sent back into danger\.

#### Eritrean Man Dies in Zintan Detention Center

Another Eritrean refugee has died of a preventable condition in the Libyan detention camp Zintan, [according to human rights lawyer Giulia Tranchina](https://www.facebook.com/rastajuly/posts/10156834998898621?hc_location=ufi) \.


> He was only 24 and died of TB after years of starvation, inhuman conditions, and torture in detention in Libya\. He is the 23rd refugee to have died in Zintan\. Yesterday all UN agencies had a meeting in Zintan, but UNHCR told them that the GDF is full and only once the refugees in the GDF will be evacuated/relocated \(which can take months\) then they will go to take some from Zintan, but they told them only a small group of you\. There are no options, no hopes, no solutions\. They are all dying slowly, 23 only in Zintan over the last eight months\. Killed by torture, sickness, starvation, overcrowding and horrific sanitary conditions\. Another young boy who will never hug his family again\.

### Sea
#### Sea\-Watch Wins Appeal

A judge in The Hague ruled in favor of the Sea\-Watch rescue NGO this week in a case over new regulations which would have forced their rescue ships off the sea for a time\.


> The Court’s judgment acknowledges that the negative consequences of omitting a transitional period for the more stringent safety regulations on Sea\-Watch’s ship, namely that people may drown due to limited rescue capacity in the Mediterranean Sea, outweigh the purpose of the new regulations\. Therefore, Sea\-Watch will have until 31 December 2019 to apply the new policy to its ship\. 





> The trial shows that Sea\-Watch is resisting the arbitrary behaviour of states\. For Sea\-Watch, this is not only a victory in obtaining a transitional period for the application of changes to our ship; it is also a victory in the sense that a civil player has held a government accountable for its deadly actions\. 





The Open Arms ship [rescued 55 people](https://www.facebook.com/watchthemed.alarmphone/photos/a.1526182797655958/2421369951470567/?type=3&__xts__[0]=68.ARDaRe3ZdrZ1BsTgSrGEXFpnn9sn-KvQgJAO9O9fIULswHBIXUIJCbpfjG6JsgRHn6KNwl2bhqGKul3ZURANg64mn04ObMPF1aibX8sPz6Xl8BjfLXq9kkwUiTsYiyprZ0DsAFwf_cB70787bc939qD4kRZ3XAlHgJ7v77aor_miz8VUJyDsl-9TDq3kJTYwbE1iAsncEgnLlxjmdM4heq4YLUy_ofF0pKPzMKNqyvqWU-UWoGpx6DXLTKxr9OwJ34sBcvcPQ5MP6yvuG2sJWY_oeZpFov98a1b9Id7htgS84L5yLuXVIdaKiVhQMIEM6-eavr_tFHKamVMLUhEimsKuGsyP&__tn__=-R&hc_location=ufi) today who departed from Libya in the Central Mediterranean\. The dinghy was punctured and taking on water when the rescue vessel arrived\. If it had arrived later, everyone would have likely drowned\. However, the battle is sadly not yet over for those rescued\. Open Arms is now looking for a safe place to harbor\.

### Greece
#### 118 People Headed to Aegean Islands Intercepted

There was a large number of interceptions of boats headed towards the Aegean Islands on Wednesday\. Boats headed to Samos, Lesbos and Kos were stopped by patrols from Frontex and the Greek Coast Guard\. A total of 118 people were stopped\.
#### Aid Groups and Volunteers Blocked from Working in Vial Camp as Conditions Deteriorate

Aid groups and independent volunteers are reporting rapidly deteriorating conditions and overcrowding in the Vial camp on Chios\. The temperature has reached new highs on the island, adding to the general misery of refugees forced to live and sleep out in the open\. To compound these problems, authorities in the camp have taken an increasingly combative stance towards aid groups, blocking a great deal of groups and services from reaching people in the camp\. One volunteer from the [Chios People’s Warehouse](https://www.facebook.com/chiospeopleswarehouse/?__tn__=kC-R&eid=ARD7BBhD9JIrTlSh9QbyAZ6wlKDkVDKtGo041MSTc8jwtfV-UnKp_u_IHcrHy3BboLze3qTc38lLiTmP&hc_ref=ARSk2pNppIZzCrZlM-ACd_bi7un-kERi2EKF1OyS5jlXmf6EYXzugw3e6JLOMjg2NYU&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARCN4AxtMVFDvd8p6JOdz9KGr5OczKLZD5CArZAVMYASR9BtPmToeoU4TcBtTcJCUmxGj_HD09-GOJMnHo6jdEuKxcgGKDNaKkmPW5C7Dv2Hq08vxl1UF8pHeELxgHTb33O0gyFzQe9lcsnnGElz4Ab0I27-EXpHJw7bqOCkTC-e4pvnNaPwVYEqLElwOwMDR2rkNlHsd-bibSpT8JaEShzQICezu5ajCC1nq47V9BUUn2iHB6oMCGdaYe6jOU5vU9k0Dgo7SYZyEYfJTV4JkMtpBdAFZkSJPDyF06kgieP0RyabGILSl312P-oDRqc0k6qIqMxkdApov-lQ9nKlPbKycEL1ZsGHhY0) described the current conditions in the camp in a public post:


> Τhe tents are now placed at the back of Vial so that they are not visible to the visitor who does not have access to the camp\. People in distress, mentally and physically injured, pick up a sleeping bag and a blanket from the center’s “reception” and look for shade below 30 degrees Celsius to spend their night\. Many people are sleeping on the beaches as well, with obvious implications for their health\. High temperatures, lack of drinking water, insect bites, snakes\. 





> Volunteers groups distribute tents, canvas and sunlight\. With frequent checks by the police, the team, despite their years of efforts, hasn’t received permission from the immigration ministry\. 





> The problem with the water supply still exists with people telling us that they haven’t bathed for days since the water runs out so fast\. 





> Many volunteer groups attempt to support unaccompanied minors in Vial\. The number is very large and the so\-called safe zones are not suitable for the accommodation of so many children\. However, we are denied entry by Vial’s administration\. Activities self\-evident in prison, such as English lessons, meet the strict rules of the Camp administration\. Not taking into account that the unaccompanied are one of the most vulnerable groups of refugees and need continuous support that is not provided, the Vial administration closes the door to international educators and psychologists who are well\-disposed and qualified to take care of and teach these children\. 





> The number of the so\-called “beneficiaries” of the Vial Reception and Identification Center in Chios has exceeded 2,000 people\.

A large number of people on the move have been driven into the Vucjak camp by Bosnian police, [according to medical volunteers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/144469886266984/permalink/387874908593146/) working in the area\. There are now over 1,000 people living in the camp\. The medical team reported seeing over 100 people on some days this week\. The camp is becoming more overcrowded, with little space left between the tents\. The Red Cross is delivering food, but there is often not enough to feed the camp\.
### Denmark
#### SD Government Wavers on Promise to Relocate Families from Sjælsmark

A staff member from the Sjælsmark deportation center has opened a debate on the future accommodation of families with children currently living in the center\.

The relocation of these families was promised by the new Social Democrat\-led government, based on criticism about conditions at Sjælsmark made by the Danish Ombudsman\. The Danish Red Cross maintains that the families must be relocated in accordance with the promises given from the new government, but there has been [no reaction from the Ministry of Immigration](https://www.altinget.dk/artikel/aabent-brev-fra-sjaelsmark-medarbejder-flyt-ikke-boernefamilierne-ud?fbclid=IwAR2xs4BqXcatfmVQYeIcPnuSwff4YiPjBIWGmQ7bbU4yNhXHCssKyILN-dY) yet\.

A 48\-hour sit\-in action is planned for the end of the month at the other Danish deportation prison, Ellebæk\. Most of the inmates in Ellebæk are not convicted or suspected of specific crimes, but are deprived of freedom as a means to motivate or secure their departure from the country\. In this regime, they are subject to some of the most restrictive conditions in Denmark\.
### Italy

Around 600 asylum seekers have been moved from Friuli\-Venezia Giulia to other regions\. A number of these people have been relocated to Gorizia, and some to the Cara detention center\.

The police of Udine [discovered 11 asylum seekers](https://www.rainews.it/tgr/fvg/articoli/2019/07/fvg-immigrati-irregolari-edifici-vuoti-13867f7a-d0ad-433e-b2a4-ff97f30fe066.html) living in the basements of some buildings under construction near the city stadium\. All of them were detained\.
### France
#### Council of State Rules Against Attempt to Strip “Dublined” Refugees of Accommodation and Allowance Rights

The French Council of State [ruled on Wednesday](https://www.infomigrants.net/fr/post/18548/les-dublines-pourront-continuer-a-percevoir-l-allocation-pour-demandeur-d-asile?fbclid=IwAR0ZsrfMQkR1ckQxnkPuiDDaKhyZcbn1veTBxZbHoAmkdLeZ_Z49JcN1-A0) against a decree included in the Asylum and Immigration Act\. The decree in question gave the Office for Immigration and Integration the right to refuse immigrants and refugees assistance with accommodation or an allowance, especially for people who had been returned to France under the “Dublin” regulations\. The court found that this decree was “not in accordance with European law\.”

Refugee Info Bus is looking for funds for their mobile phone project for refugees in Calais\. Every week, their phones are used to make urgent calls by dozens of refugees\.

### General
#### Aegean Boat Report in Need of Funds

Aegean Boat Report has long been the most reliable source of information on new arrivals and landings on the Aegean islands\. Many volunteer and media organizations, including AYS, rely on Aegean Boat Report for this info\. As the man behind the ABR posted today, many people think that this is the work of an organization with many volunteers\. In fact, there is only one person behind ABR, a Norwegian volunteer named Tommy Olsen\.

While the new arrivals reports are the visible part of ABR’s work, there is also an unseen half\. As Olsen explained,


> Aegean Boat Report is only a part of what I do, the part I can publish about\. I’m also involved in what many refer to as “online rescue\.” It’s complicated, but short version is that people in distress at sea make contact, desperately asking for help\. My role in this is as a mediator, between the boat in distress and rescue services\. We have saved thousands of lives, by providing good, accurate information, so that people have been found in time\. But not everyone has been saved, for some it was too late…\. 





> Many ask why are you doing this alone? — what’s in it for you, why use all your time on people you don’t know? — there is no point, because you can’t help everyone\. And yes, it’s true, I can’t help everyone\. But I can help someone, everyone can in their own way\. If my work have saved one life, only one, my time spent over the years has been worth it\. 





Olsen is in need of funding so he continue his work full\-time\. [Support him here\.](https://www.facebook.com/donate/493847507854590/622600014929773/)
