A demonstration held on Saturday outside a detention centre in the city of Krosno Odrza≈Ñskie in western Poland was met with a swift response from police, who reportedly used tear gas and batons on the protestors, arresting and detaining 11 people\.

‚ÄúWe express categorical opposition to suspicions directed towards detained activists,‚Äù the No Borders Team said in a [Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/nobordersteam/) \. ‚ÄúIn our assessment, the reaction and brutality of the police was disproportionate, and the police gas, sticks and discs were used without any messages and without prior warning\.‚Äù

Activists had gathered outside a detention centre where people on the move were being held in the city\. Earlier this month the Polish deputy commissioner for human rights \(ombudsman\) Hanna Machinska [said](https://www.brusselstimes.com/eu-affairs/206107/polish-ombudsman-humanitarian-situation-for-migrants-in-detention-centres-worse-than-in-prisons?fbclid=IwAR0J5gE9S8AeJvfa5TTDZBfxsaI3SP9jGmtOr2M7-StfcqJbWpHKX8iLon8) that the conditions for people held in detention centres are worse than the conditions in prisons\.

‚ÄúPersons deprived of their liberty, for the sake of their passport, have basically no rights\. They don‚Äôt know how long they will be closed, they are deprived of contact with family and loved ones, they are denied proper medical and psychological care,‚Äù No Borders wrote\. ‚ÄúTreating people like this is torture\. There will never be our consent for this\!‚Äù

No Borders reported that one protestor was taken to the hospital, and that ‚Äúmany others were gassed and beaten\.‚Äù Later that evening, a solidarity rally was held for the 11 detained persons outside the district police command station in the city\.



Videos posted on Twitter show large numbers of police in riot gear surrounding the protestors\. One injured protestor lies on the ground, while another is dragged away by authorities\.

A detailed account of the protest can be read in translation [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XJk_okN7sOgS7DdGKrIVYBBHlO9RJL-aOVOyzZ10BNo/edit?fbclid=IwAR01hF-rm4Nh20QTazEunrdO--XrCk-4d1WLgSK2KxnPaiadn9nZDD11mv8) \.



No Borders wrote on Facebook that one of those detained has been officially charged with ‚Äúactive assault on an officer,‚Äù a crime which can carry a sentence of one to ten years\. The detained are in custody in the cities of Zielona G√≥ra and Kro≈õno Odrza≈Ñski\.

The collective ‚ÄúSZPIL\(A\)‚Äù is searching for photos and videos of the protest, which can be sent to [Szpila@szpila\.info](mailto:Szpila@szpila.info) \.
### TUNISIA
#### People on the move hold protest in Tunisia demanding evacuation

Dozens of people on the move from sub\-Saharan Africa staged a protest in the southern Tunisian port town of Zarzis on Monday to demand their evacuation from the country, [media](https://www.rfi.fr/en/middle-east/20220214-refugees-protest-in-tunisia-demanding-evacuation?fbclid=IwAR0E-3ejsMxvCykK0j9tS4139S706e2caQ2mpWTAGzRG5X2CMjrgGfn--TY) reported\.

Many of the people had already tried the deadly Mediterranean crossing, and said they were ‚Äúmarginalised‚Äù in Tunisia\. The sit\-in was held outside the headquarters of the UNHCR in Zarzis\.

‚ÄúWe have refugee status but this organisation \(UNHCR\) does not care about us,‚Äù one Sudanese protester told media\.

‚ÄúWe are marginalised\. Our conditions are inhumane,‚Äù he added\.

Some of the people held signs that read ‚ÄúWe are in danger‚Äù and ‚ÄúStop the violence against us\.‚Äù

### GREECE
#### ‚ÄòBoat driving‚Äô trial of 11 people begins on Samos

A trial involving 11 people accused of steering their boat from Turkey to Greece began on Samos yesterday, Borderline Europe wrote on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BorderlineEurop/status/1493209991809048585?s=20&t=QBXEhhPuMy-ODAGODCY9Zw&fbclid=IwAR06zT8Rztp1V-xFgGTEv0zck4OaRL8d-K_ELaiqk35sKeV6_xcwsCyRE8g) \. Among the accused is a 23\-year\-old Syrian who faces 10 years in prison after he turned on his phone‚Äôs GPS when the boat was lost at sea, guiding himself and his fellow passengers to safety in Greece\.

On the first day of the trial of the Syrian, known as G\.N\., the prosecutor demanded that the accused be acquitted, the first such move in a boat driving case, Borderline [reported](https://twitter.com/BorderlineEurop/status/1493292820320423950?s=20&t=QBXEhhPuMy-ODAGODCY9Zw&fbclid=IwAR1JLwjHM8_EczjOGlhUJVBeEX00iFYPey-LmHPy2N0-BY_WwsW0M-lzmDI) \.

‚ÄúIt was the first time the procedure was perfect and just\. We are happy to announce there is hope,‚Äù said Dimitris Choulis, G\.N\.‚Äôs lawyer\.
#### Simultaneous protests to be held against closed structures on Chios, Lesvos and Samos

Simultaneous protests are being organized on Chios, Lesvos and Samos against the creation of closed structures on the islands, Greek media [reported](https://astraparis.gr/katevazei-rola-i-chios-stis-23-fevroyarioy-sygkentrosi-diamartyrias-stin-plateia/?fbclid=IwAR0USfMBMBABzRlre_PCvUm42aAL89rpzSesqDbXVc-WsGYcs2v3nhgMeTo) \. The protests began yesterday, February 14\.
#### POM speak out against Ioannina camp turning into closed structure

People on the move are speaking out against the Greek government‚Äôs plans to turn the camp in Ioannina into a closed facility, Greek media [reported](https://www.efsyn.gr/ellada/koinonia/332010_ypsonoyn-teihos-sti-domi-ton-ioanninon) \. In a closed structure, entry and exit from the camp at night is prohibited, and other movement restrictions exist as well\.

‚ÄúWe are not criminals and we should not be in prison\. Why are they locking us inside walls?‚Äù one person said\.
### ITALY
#### Two Nigerians bring case to a UN committee against Italy and Libya

Two Nigerian women are bringing a case to a UN committee against Italy and Libya, claiming that both the countries failed to protect their human rights as women and left them at risk of trafficking, exploitation and abuse, media [reported](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/37752/exploitation-and-enslavement-two-nigerian-migrants-take-rights-case-to-un-committee?fbclid=IwAR1wv1WuXVPynqsTw6marA6FajLLwtzQ7bbAX7QlC8w2p0hDEobJufdTcV4) \.

The women, Princess and Doris \(not their real names\) arrived in Libya from Nigeria in 2017 and 2018, respectively, and claim they were trafficked to Libya by criminal networks looking to sell them for prostitution\.

The case was brought to the UN CEDAW committee \(Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women\) \. More can be read about Princess and Doris at the link above\.
#### Amnesty International Italy calls for cancellation of MOU with Libya

Amnesty International Italy is calling for the country‚Äôs MOU with Libya to be dissolved amid strong evidence of widespread human rights abuses\.

The [letter](https://www.amnesty.it/appelli/italia-libia-cancellare-il-memorandum-dintesa/?fbclid=IwAR1hXoHkGGdkfUlShmlD9snXrHYCwtjV7HWvaq6SdUc1kPOKl-X3LGV-n4k) , addressed to the Italian prime minister, interior minister, minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation, and the defense minister, read as follows:


> It has been 5 years since the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding between Italy and Libya on February 2, 2017\. Throughout this time we have continued to document human rights violations and abuses of migrants and refugees, including unlawful killings, torture and other ill\-treatment, rape and other sexual violence, arbitrary indefinite detention in cruel and inhuman conditions and forced labor\. 





> Despite this, Italy continues to provide material support and pursue migration policies that allow Libyan coastguards to intercept men, women and children who try to escape in search of safety by crossing the Mediterranean Sea and allow their forced return to Libya, where they come\. subjected to unlawful detention and abuse of all kinds\. 





> I ask the Italian government not to continue to be complicit in these abuses, and to act urgently so that: 





> \- the memorandum of understanding between Italy and Libya is canceled immediately and in any case before it is automatically renewed for another three years, on November 2, 2022; 





> \- forms of assistance to Libyan forces that lead to the containment of people in situations of abuse are stopped, and cooperation with Libya on migration is conditional on the approval by Libya of concrete measures aimed at protecting the human rights of refugees and migrants; 





> \- action is taken, in concert with the Libyan government and with European states and institutions, to ensure that migrants and refugees arbitrarily detained in detention centers in Libya are released and transferred to a safe place; 





> \- a parliamentary commission of inquiry into the consequences of cooperation with Libya on border control is created\.
