### Greece

Three people have been deported from Lesvos to Turkey despite an ongoing asylum procedure, [reports](https://dm-aegean.bordermonitoring.eu/2020/01/29/three-people-deported-despite-ongoing-asylum-procedure/?fbclid=IwAR2G6vXE0sdcm9huSRDc0yWd7b9_Xps_MC_o2zStOA0uSs_Bxs2kztTPMus) Deportation Monitoring Aegean\. “Two lawyers had filed an application of annulment at the court to challenge the rejection of the asylum application and suspensive measures in order to stop their deportation\.” Despite attempts to stop the deportation, they have been expelled together with six other people\.

The European Asylum Support Office \(EASO\) wants to double its staff to 1000 in Greece in the next months, [reports](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-greece-easo-idUSKBN1ZR1E6?fbclid=IwAR0AskvhuLIQ9fgdsg0sbzQN6Hat2zmBs4j31l_srwntqXY-3MzFpvNjakM) Reuters\. With its new asylum strategy, the government wants to speed up the procedure and deport more people to Turkey\. At the same time, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis called for greater European solidarity in dealing with new arrivals, [writes](http://www.ekathimerini.com/248961/article/ekathimerini/news/mitsotakis-calls-for-greater-european-solidarity-on-turkey-migration?fbclid=IwAR2bCG-Bv8b9VIDuerfrsEwAkY47nkzlzl2GothKnSLmB0C7hW2vked6NwI) Ekathimerini\.

Meanwhile, the Greek Defense Ministry started a bid for private contractors, supplying a 2\.7 kilometer\-long floating barrier to prevent boats from crossing the sea, [according](https://www.whio.com/news/greece-plans-floating-border-barrier-stop-migrants/Pv66NBd2x9KPcZVEjnkK8M/) to Whio\. The costs are estimated at €500,000 over four years\.

At the Moria hotspot on Lesvos, a 15\-year\-old boy is in critical condition, after he was stabbed\. In another incident, another 15\-year\-old by was stabbed but his life is not in danger, Stonisi [reports](https://twitter.com/rspaegean/status/1222504669550927874?s=21&fbclid=IwAR0nDwISl-Ys0b6oPS4VdB9Evlq0orZRMEsFcSDCMLoLvwAuNL8LwFJvR74) \.

The Mobile Info Team for refugees in Greece reports that a residence permit, which expires before 30 June 2020, can now be renewed\.

### Sweden

In a [debate](https://www.rights.no/2020/01/akesson-sverige-er-fullt/?fbclid=IwAR3iEZPxJ4Dw_UxR50oRT-ofl6T_pejcRGQXl0E4hhKEzG7GRkE_ecUH3Go) on the national TV channel SVT, the issue of immigration was discussed among the leaders of the political parties, and the leader of the Sweden Democrats \(SD\) Jimmie Åkesson maintained that conditions on the ground in Sweden indicate that the country can no longer tolerate asylum or refugee immigration\. — Today Sweden does not have capacity\. The municipalities say to a large extent that they do not have the capacity\. Where shall all these people live? What welfare should we provide for them? Which schools should they attend? These answers are missing, and before you have these answers, you have to say stop\. It’s that simple, said Åkesson, also including UN\-quota refugees in his position\. 
In this way the leader of the party known as hostile to foreigners and immigrants attacked the present Social Democratic government, for taking in the present number of 5,000 UN\-quota refugees\. 
The SD are headed towards being the largest party in the Swedish parliament \(Riksdagen\) and are continuously pushing the immigration agenda\.

People in Sweden today protested against the deportation of an Afghan, who came to the country five years ago and is now in custody\. The reason for his planned deportation is that he submitted his asylum application one day too late according to a law that entered into force retroactively, two years ago\.

Many young adults who are deported to Afghanistan from Sweden have a rough time after having being sent back\. — Every one I’ve met is suffering mentally and physically, says Vian Delsoz from Malmö, who has been involved with several of these young adults\. So much so that she has travelled several times to Kabul and other places in Afghnistan to support — among other things, she built a house for — them\.
### Germany

The parties of the state parliament in Bremen voted to host at least 20 unaccompanied minors from Greece, [reports](https://www.butenunbinnen.de/nachrichten/politik/minderjaehrige-fluechtlinge-aufnahme-bremen-100.html?fbclid=IwAR125hx2tpwV8IEVueE-nIlVXIGOyTI5LnFc1Z1xfwL5MqN0mto2m2_aRy8) Butenunbinnen\. The senate is now expected to advocate this position at the federal level\. Ulrich Mäurer, senator for internal affairs, said: “The conditions there are inhumane, it is a catastrophe and a disgrace for the European Union\.” The neighboring state of Lower Saxony is demanding to transfer up to 200 children under 14 years\. On Saturday, 8 February, Seebrücke is calling for a demonstration to take more people\.
