At least 70 people have died in the Mediterranean, off the coast of Tunisia today\. It is the deadliest incident in the Mediterranean since January\. 443 deaths have been recorded in the Mediterranean in 2019, but unfortunately the actual figure is much higher\. It should be noted that the proportion of deaths versus attempted crossings has risen from 1\.2% in 2018 to 1\.6% in 2019, as reported by The Missing Migrants project\.

Alarm Phone reports that the boat most likely departed from Libya and the numbers of deceased are likely to rise\. 16 people were saved by fishermen\.

In another incident that occurred off the coast of Libya, 100 people, including 24 women and 8 children, have been intercepted and returned to Libya by the Libyan Coast Guard\. Their boat was in distress due to engine failure, reports Alarm Phone\.

[_Today a report was released by Channel 4 News \(UK\)_](Revealed: human rights abuses in Libyan migrant camps As many as 70 people have died trying to reach Europe after their boat capsized in the Mediterranean Sea on the way…www.channel4.com) that showed an attack that occurred on a detention center in Libya\. Truly horrific scenes are witnessed as at least two refugees were killed and dozens injured by gunfire in the detention center\.

In this report, Dimitris Avramopolous, the EU Migration Commissioner has admitted to the hypocrisy of EU policy in Libya, but the question remains… What will be done to stop these EU funded and EU orchestrated atrocities? What policies will be changed to stop people being sent back to Libya where they risk death? When will rescue boats be allowed to operate in the Mediterranean to save the lives of people fleeing to Europe via the sea? When will Europe stop funding the Libyan Coast Guard?

UNHCR and IOM are quick to denounce the conditions in Libya and deaths in the Mediterranean, but fail to offer any practical solutions that are of much value to the people affected\. Their outrage on social media platforms is no consolation to the people who die at sea while trying to flee Libya, while rescue boats are criminalized and prevented from saving lives by EU Authorities\. Are these genuine advocacy efforts or well\-developed government approved PR stunts?

#### LIBYA

141 people have been transferred from Zawiya Detention centre yesterday to the UNHCR GDF Centre\. Sally Hayden reports that people described feelings of guilt as they had to leave others behind\.
