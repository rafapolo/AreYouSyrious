#### Feature: Police Brutality on Greek island of Samos

Refugees protesting the deplorable conditions in the Samos camp were met with tear gas and police batons this Saturday morning\. According to statements by NGO workers and refugees, a protest began around 7:30 on Saturday morning when a line of police officers blocked the path of refugees\.

An independent photojournalist who is working on the island, Jérôme Fourcade, was detained by the police, who demanded to see the contents of his camera\. Fourcade and a number of NGO workers at the scene were taken to the police station, but were released without charges after a few hours\. It seems that the police took advantage of the absence of journalists and NGO eyes on the scene, and began firing tear gas canisters and attacking people with batons\. One man [sent an image to the media](https://www.euronews.com/2019/05/25/exclusive-violence-breaks-out-between-residents-of-refugee-camp-and-police-on-greek-island?fbclid=IwAR0I48sa1hw-S0H5FrzOjODRC7L2XyuJIBIvbXaZfbj6CXvLyYRaz_BbuGw) of severe welts on his back after being beaten by the police\. Fourcade witnessed some of the violence before being detained, and described the police “charging” at the peaceful protestors\.

The Samos camp is considered to be one of the worst refugee camps in Greece, and in Europe over all\. There are over 4,000 people crammed into the hillside camp that was intended for 700\.
### Lebanon
#### Syrian refugees deported directly from Beirut Airport upon landing

16 Syrian refugees were summarily deported after arriving at the Beirut airport, according to a joint statement by Human Rights Watch, the Lebanese Center for Human Rights \(CLDH\), Legal Agenda, Frontiers Rights, and the Access Center for Human Rights\. 5 of the 16 had official UNHCR status as refugees within Lebanon, and at least 13 expressed fear of being tortured or killed if they were returned to Syria, [according to HRW](https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/05/24/lebanon-syrians-summarily-deported-airport?fbclid=IwAR1L-uxMZ8bzTkSeAcSknYqk7IVSDNrHZZGLPb8qFCNO_MRtdAp3vG0ZKEk) \.

### Greece

**Open Letter published by Greek Border guard in Evros**

An open letter has been published by a Greek Border guard who works in the Evros region, along the Greek\-Turkish land border\. The officer described the brutality with which the officers are expected to track and capture migrants\. Perhaps the most incendiary part of the letter was the officer’s claim that the police often use regular, non\-rubber coated bullets when apprehending refugees, rather than the rubber bullets dictated by law \(which are still very dangerous\) \. You can read the letter in full \[Greek\] [here](https://diktiospartakos.blogspot.com/2019/05/blog-post_472.html?fbclid=IwAR0ceEBVucncXdoZIgJSWvHqSe5zO8YzjFRh_EQ9a4h3Mp6iFsGu-mfi6w0) \.

### Bosnia and Herzegovina

This is the month of Ramadan, but for the many refugees who are currently in Bosnia, there is no “Ramadan Kareem”\. As solidarity volunteers stated this weekend,


> “the month of Ramadan is the hope of all Muslims, that this will be a sacred month\. That’s how it should be\. But here in our city people live next to us in inhuman conditions, humiliated, in the meadow, sidewalk, without the possibility to eat, bathe even in cold water, use toilets, have health protection, nutrition,\. \. there are around 500 migrants\. Sleeping on concrete, icy, wet land, many sick\. Every raindrop is on them\.” 





Once again, those who are mostly supporting them are the locals across the country who show solidarity from day to day, as well as volunteers in Kladuša and Bihać, assisting those with no lodging\.

The volunteers from [Udruženje Solidarnost](https://www.facebook.com/solidarnostbosnia/?__tn__=%2CdkCH-R-R&eid=ARCcnvC49YTIQ4FiDVnWPSMZ1BFcAFoGOcYoAq3LZcU_pTGXVN0DLoiRHCBogzOLyJItlxg549bypQk-&hc_ref=ARQvGZrskbIQdawD9OuoA4215N84i4E11Ps_BIAas8hxZ3cpk6uCdzW1jkHt83TmkeY&hc_location=group) recently shared a video of refugees sleeping in a parking lot in Bosnia, where they are sleeping out in the open, totally exposed to the cold and the rain\.

#### Shipping containers sent from Germany to Bosnia to serve as refugee housing

36 shipping container housing units have been sent from Diedorf to Bihac in Bosnia, where they will serve as housing for refugees in the camp there, according to [German media](https://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/augsburg-land/Fluechtlingsunterkuenfte-reisen-800-Kilometer-weit-nach-Bosnien-id54384036.html?fbclid=IwAR0hgBjYjB64jXiNu7g4McMAJrTFGm83IzbwP71IDikz3mo979bgIX_wovg) \.
### Germany
#### Security forces in the Lindenstraße camp in Bremen attack young refugees

Activists from the Together We Are Bremen group reported an attack against refugees by the security forces in the Lindenstraße camp over this weekend\. The attack was preceded by months of provocations and racist insults by the security forces, according to Together We Are Bremen\. The group posted a public statement today:


> The situation \[in Lindenstraße\] has become unbearable\. The inhabitants feel threatened\. The security service deliberately escalates situations, attacks people, throws them to the ground, chokes them and threatens them\. The attacks take place under the eyes of the AWO\. They do not only tolerate them but respond to the many complaints of the residents in saying that the AWO is not responsible for the security forces and therefore they could do nothing…\. 





> Just a few weeks ago, security forces at the University Hospital in Hamburg killed William Tounou\-Mbobda with a brutal and racist assault\. In order to avoid more deaths, we demand the ministry of social affairs to immediately terminate the contract with the security group in Lindenstraße \! 





The group is calling for a rally in front of the Ministry of Social Affairs, on Tuesday, 28\.05\. at 1pm, Bahnhofsplatz 29, Bremen, in order for people to show their solidarity with the people facing violence in Lindenstraße camp\.
### Austria
#### Deportation Warning for Afghans

### Malta
#### 216 people rescued off the coast of Malta

Over 200 people were rescued from dinghies on Friday by the Armed Forces of Malta \(AFM\) \. According to AFM, there were many minors and at least one pregnant woman among the group\. According to Maltese authorities, those rescued will have the opportunity to apply for asylum within the country\. While this is what is dictated by EU and international law, it can never be assumed the law will be followed\. According to a [Maltese journalist](https://twitter.com/ReginaCatrambon/status/1132560551178055680?fbclid=IwAR13lvvuAoTbWPyYHKEIhnM_lqYIixrZnfplomk0ldIi2DxpUo1r8OlyHFY) , all of those rescued are in good condition\.
### Italy
#### Update from Ventimiglia, refugees describe beatings by French border police \(via [Progretto20k](http://Progetto20k) \)

In the last few weeks our monitoring efforts in Ventimiglia have detected between 20\-30 rejections per day, and several instances of violence against detained people committed by the PAF \(French border police\) \. As a witness explained to us, during the night of May 21st, the PAF beat a pregnant girl and then refused to call the ambulance, despite rescue requests\. On May 23, two young boys were beaten by the same cop, who also broke the phone of one of them \(the phone contained the photos of his documents\) \. During detention in the French container people are often denied food and water, despite various people who are following Ramadan and need water and food at night\. Following the request to have food or simply water many boys have been threatened with physical violence\.

### General

May 25th is International Missing Children’s Day\. On this day of remembrance, the Refugee Women’s Center in Northern France has sent a reminder of how many refugee children are missing in Europe\. While there are approximately 10,000 child refugees missing in Europe, the number missing in Turkey is nearly 100,000\. From the [Refugee Women’s Center](http://Refugee Women's Centre) :


> According to UNICEF, one third of all refugees and migrants in Europe are children\. The most recent information about how many of those children are missing comes from a Europol report that is now over 3 years old\. That report stated there were an estimated 10,000 missing child refugees\. In February of this year, the deputy chair of human rights in the ruling Justice and Development Party of Turkey stated that since 2015 over 96,000 refugee children have gone missing and their whereabouts are still unknown\. 





> Nearly 100,000\.
