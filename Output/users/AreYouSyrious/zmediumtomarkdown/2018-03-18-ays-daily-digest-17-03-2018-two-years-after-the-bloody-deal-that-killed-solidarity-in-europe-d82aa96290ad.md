**FEATURE**

Two sisters from Afghanistan and their 3 children [have been deported](https://www.tolonews.com/afghanistan/austria-deports-afghan-sisters-children-based-eu-ruling) from Austria back to Croatia at the beginning of the week\.

They arrived in Austria in 2016 and, since then, have done everything they could to integrate in the Austrian culture, by learning German and enrolling the children in local schools\.

The reason for the deportation is obviously the Dublin regulation, as Austrian authorities claimed that the family should have applied for asylum in the first country of entrance\.

Even the European Court of Justice ruled in the case in July, stating that the Dublin regulation permitted countries to “ _unilaterally or bilaterally in a spirit of solidarity… examine applications for international protection lodged with them, even if they are not required to_ ”\.

Also lawyers supported the family, saying that the 2 women and the 3 children had integrated so well that they should have been allowed to stay in the country, which is continuously using this heartless policy against people in need\.

“ _We were sleeping in our room and then the police came_ ,” Jafari recalled, wiping tears from her face\. “ _I fled to my neighbor, and the police came to me with a dog and found us, and then they sent us here_ ”\.

Another [deportation](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1832082373489098&id=100000620594847) from Austria to Croatia of a Syrian family is planned for today, but further investigation is needed to have a complete picture of the situation\. This is the information we have so far:

A Syrian family with 3 children is going to be deported to Croatia today\. The youngest child was born in Austria\. — As it seems, the Croatian authorities have not replied about whether the family has been registered in Croatia, and they are scheduled to be deported\. They have been in Austria for 2 years, and one of the children is receiving psychological treatment because of his trauma\.

**SYRIA**

The civilian block in Eastern Ghouta, formed by representatives of institutions, activists, humanitarian workers and local council’s members, has issued a [statement](https://www.facebook.com/ActForGhouta/posts/1888179467881223?hc_location=ufi) explaining the creation of the block\. The block aims to represent the voices of the civilians who have been silenced by the events in the besieged area\.

Meanwhile, according to the Portuguese [Expresso](http://expresso.sapo.pt/internacional/2018-03-17-Siria-Mais-de-150.000-pessoas-fugiram-de-Afrine-desde-quarta-feira#gs.IwoKXYU) , over 150\.000 people have left Afrin since Wednesday to escape the fury of the Turkish offensive\.

**SEA**

After landing in Pozzallo \(Sicily\) and during the disembarkment operations of the 216 people rescued in the past days, the Founder and the Head of the Mission of Proactiva Open Arms left the port escorted by the police\. Last updates say that the HoM was held for 6 hours at the police station, questioned by 9 agents, members of police and coast guard bodies, and the shipmaster was heard right afterwards and questioned for 5 hours\. They managed to get back to the ship late in the evening\.

MEDU \(Medici per i diritti umani\) has published some [testimonies](https://www.facebook.com/MEDUonlus/posts/10156184035979817?hc_location=ufi) from the people disembarked in Pozzallo and of what they had to go through in Libya\.

7 people were taken to hospital; among them, a 16\-year\-old girl, unaccompanied, suffering physically and psychically and a woman with a dislocated hip, caused by a violent beating in Libya\.

The 216 people rescued affirmed to have been imprisoned in a building in the Zuwarah area, on the coast, for the last weeks and been beaten up by smugglers with sticks and other objects while getting up the boat\.

The [cooperation](https://www.libyaobserver.ly/inbrief/commander-operation-sofia-says-500-new-libyan-recruits-receive-training) between European authorities and the Libyan ones is stronger than ever, with the commander of the EUNAVFOR Med’s Operation Sophia, Enrico Credendino, stating that Europe has the will to increase the expansion of the training of the LCG, recruiting between 300 and 500 members in 2018\. He also added that more than 130 people suspected of being smugglers have been arrested and handed to Italian authorities\.

**EUROPE**

On the anniversary of the EU\-Turkey deal, Refugee Support Aegean and PRO ASYL have published an interesting study concerning the manipulation of the concept of “ _Safe Third Country_ ” as a way to stop and prevent refugee flows to Europe\. Legislative changes to national asylum procedures were implemented in order to comply with the deal and recognise Turkey as a safe third country, “ _paving the way for forced returns of refugees to Turkey_ ”\.

The full study can be found [here](http://rsaegean.org/stopthetoxicdeal-turkey-as-a-safe-third-country/)

Today, marches all over Europe have been held to demonstrate against any form of racism and fascism and for a more human and equal treatment of migrants:

**GREECE**

_Islands_

As previously reported, on the second anniversary of the EU\-Turkey deal, we received the news that a boat capsized off the Agathonissi island, counting 16 dead people, 5 of them the children, and 3 missing\. Just 3 of the 22 people on the boat managed to survive\.


[![SAO Association]( "SAO Association")](https://www.facebook.com/SAOassociation/posts/2120442511510471)


AYS team members in Greece report that “ _The three survivors of today’s shipwreck are currently in hospital on Samos, where they are expected to stay for a few days\. They are supposed to be sheltered somewhere after this, either in Samos or Athens_ ”\.

[Samos Volunteers](https://samosvolunteers.org) also issued a statement regrading the tragedy, noting that it coincided with the two year anniversary of the EU\-Turkey deal:


> Today, at least 16 people drowned off the shore of Samos in their attempt to find safety in Europe\. At least six of the lives lost were children under the age of 5\. They won’t live to blow out five candles on their birthday cake, to learn how to read and write, or to live a life in peace and safety, away from war\. These people are not “irregular migrants”, they are women, children, young people, men, and families, trying to escape oppression and war\. 





> Two years after the commencement of the EU\-Turkey deal, a ‘most noble endeavor’ of Europe, it once again becomes clear that trapping people is in no way ‘an alternative’\. The stated goal of stopping refugees from risking their lives is a cynical lie\. The EU\-Turkey deal has only made the border more dangerous by making it more militarized and by criminalizing people who need protection\. Refugees need safe passage, and the opportunity to apply for asylum under a fair system, not more fences, guns, and patrol boats\. 





> We dedicate today to the people who lost their lives near the island of Samos, and to all those who have needlessly died on this journey\. In their memory, we stand against the EU\-Turkey deal, and re\-commit ourselves to the cause of solidarity and humanity\. 





_Mainland_

According to [this source](https://www.facebook.com/groups/eidomeni.refugee.support/permalink/1786977031609902/?hc_location=ufi) \(Greek only\), at least 2 people died when trying to avoid police checks in the Xanthi area, not far from Kavala \(northern Greece\), on Saturday morning\.

The driver, probably a smuggler, in the attempt to avoid a police blockade, speed up and lost control of the vehicle, ending the race in a nearby filed\. Two people are reported as victims and another 7 injured\.

Protest in solidarity with Afrin\.
