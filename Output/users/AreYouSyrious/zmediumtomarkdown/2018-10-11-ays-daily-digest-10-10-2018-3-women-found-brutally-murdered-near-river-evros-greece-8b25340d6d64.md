#### FEATURE:
#### Three women attempting to reach Europe found dead with their necks slashed close to the border of Turkey and Greece

[Greek Authorities have reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/the-latest-3-women-found-dead-near-greece-turkey-border/2018/10/10/4de935fa-cc91-11e8-ad0a-0e01efba3cc1_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.f4e9e756985b) the bodies of the women were discovered near the village Pragi on Wednesday by a farmer from the village\. The women were found 50 metres from the River Evros which extends along the land border between Turkey and Greece\.

The three victims’ nationalities remain undetermined, but they appear to be from North African, Middle Eastern or Asian origins\. Their identities remain unknown\. One of the victims is believed to be under 15 years of age, while the other is between 17 and 21\. The third victim is thought to be between 30–35 years old\. The coroner, Pavlos Pavlidis, reports that the women were killed approximately four days before the bodies were discovered and he has zero doubt the deaths were caused by a criminal act\. DNA tests will be conducted to determine if the women are related\.

_‘They were found with their hands bound, each body about two or three meters away from the other\. Their throats were cut right across\.’_

The River Evros is a commonly used entry point for refugees attempting to enter Greece\. Over 10,000 refugees are reported to have arrived in Greece in the first half of 2018 by crossing the Evros\.
