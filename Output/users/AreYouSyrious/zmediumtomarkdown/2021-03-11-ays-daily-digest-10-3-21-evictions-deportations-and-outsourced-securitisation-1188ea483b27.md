#### FEATURED

20 civil society organisations have lost access to reception facilities or have recently faced increasing access concerns since new legislation on the NGO registration was passed in September last year\.


> The hospital of Mytilene is overwhelmed and in some cases unwilling to treat patients\. Brubakk says there are people with severe medical issues, including a 10\-year\-old girl who required a kidney transplant and lives in a tent in the olive grove\. In addition suicide attempts are on the rise both among adults and children\. 





— write Marianna Karakoulaki & Dimitris Tosidis in their recent [story](https://www.dw.com/en/lesbos-hellish-conditions-for-refugees-in-moria/a-50384674) on the situation in Lesvos\.
We will be reporting more extensively on this in our coming daily reports and in an upcoming Special, so keep an eye out for a detailed story soon\.

At the same time, people who had been staying in a hotel near Corinth are now being evicted and are sleeping in tents on the street, as many did earlier due to evictions from hotels, provisional accommodation in school gyms and those who were the victims of right\-wing local policies\. Most people in the Corinth case are from Iraq and Syria and after their support ended they had no means to support themselves and it remains to be seeT if any systemic solution will be presented any time soon, given the number of people affected by this situation\.

#### GREECE
### Three victims of a fire in Thessaloniki

3 people have been found dead following a fire in an abandoned building in the center of Thessaloniki, reported the fire department\. The three men, believed to have been from Algeria, had been living on the third floor of the abandoned building, say media reports\. Firefighters said the men appeared to have died of smoke inhalation\. A fourth person, who told authorities he was from Morocco, survived the accident\. Reportedly, it was not immediately clear what caused the blaze\. However, such accidents are recurring events along the Route, where people reside to using unsafe spaces as shelters due to a lack of accommodation and living structures where they could support themselves\.
#### SERBIA
### An increase in the numbers of unaccompanied and separated children

Info Park noted an increase in the numbers of unaccompanied and separated children residing outside official centers in the Belgrade area\. Last week, their team provided information, translation, referrals to the Serbian Commissariat for Refugees and Migration and the Belgrade Center for Social Work for support after being pushed\-back and inclusion in age\-appropriate activities for over 45 unaccompanied boys\.


> Most of the boys were from Afghanistan, who are constantly trying the “game” and sleeping rough in Belgrade and the border area\. During the interviews, it was clear that they lack correct and timely information on their rights and the institutions providing child\-safeguarding services\.

### Community action for Madama

The already fabled trust held by people on the move—as well as those under international protection—in any of the systems they find themselves in along the way is often shattered nowadays by the very representatives of that system\. 
[One such stor](https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/auvergne-rhone-alpes/puy-de-dome/clermont-ferrand/accueilli-en-haute-loire-le-jeune-malien-menace-d-expulsion-madama-diawara-place-en-garde-a-vue-1990498.html) y comes from Puy\-de\-Dôme, central France\.

A boy from Mali, who had arrived to there two years ago, when he was barely 16, lives with a local family who had been asked by the authorities to take care of him, and were glad to do so\. When he was summoned to renew his documents, the [young man was detained](https://t.co/SHCAKHV8rd?amp=1) and was put in a detention centre, reportedly under the accusation that he’d falsified his birth certificate\.

“If he returns to Mali, he will find himself in extreme poverty and there are Islamists at the gates of his village\. It is his life that will be destroyed, and ours too”, said the family with whom he has been living all this time\. They also say it was they who communicated with Mali to retrieve his documents, not the boy who was a minor at the time\.


> For more than two years, they have been hosting and accompanying the young Malian\. A judge placed him in their home when he was only 16\. Since then, Madama has been in school, he has learned French, he has made friends, and a master is waiting for him to get his papers in order to find him a job\. 





Very quickly, the community where this young apprentice baker, Madama, lives organised a support action and created a petition that gathered more than 35,000 signatures\.

The locals are determined to do everything they can to keep their friend, fellow citizen—a young person who had escaped dangers in what happens to be his country of origin and could have been anyone else’s\.
#### SPAIN
### Outsourced destruction and violent returns

After mass\-crossing yesterday to Melilla \(as reported in yesterday’s [Daily News Digest](ays-daily-digest-09-03-2021-guilty-verdict-for-2-in-moria-fire-trial-ce1e9a72186b) \), Moroccan police have arrested hundreds and will deport them\.
Among the arrested are many women and children, reported Alarm Phone\.


> 39 women, 12 children and over 100 men were arrested\. Sources on the ground say that the men will be deported to their countries of origin, while the women and children will be pushed away from the border\.

### The Canary Islands: return orders enforceable at any time?

Dozens of people have been detained in recent weeks in the Canary Islands as they await the return orders to be executed that were issued against them when they arrived in the Canary Islands by boat\.

Details: _The court recognizes that the Aliens Act determines that it is not necessary to process an expulsion file for a person who has entered Spain irregularly; in such cases the person is formally “returned” to his or her country of origin, not expelled\. But, when the return cannot be carried out within 72 hours, the judicial authority requests the internment measure provided for the expulsion files\._

In a currently [ongoing case](https://www.efe.com/efe/canarias/sociedad/la-audiencia-de-tenerife-desactiva-las-devoluciones-inmediatas-pasadas-72-horas/50001312-4484723) , it is emphasized that the Government Delegation intends to deport the person in question to his country even though almost three months have passed since his return was ordered, that is, “after the 72\-hour period established by the norm has elapsed and after the foreigner has been at liberty after being detained for return\.”

Lawyers in the Canary Islands have complained that their clients were frequently detained to be expelled immediately on a deportation flight scheduled for the following days as part of the execution of the return order issued against them upon arrival in the archipelago\. Some have been arrested and deported after going to the airport with their passport in order to fly to the peninsula\.

The order of the Hearing of Santa Cruz de Tenerife that establishes this precedent and this interpretation on how to apply the return and expulsion mechanisms is firm, as the resolution itself clarifies in its operative section\.

Activists opposing the deportation policies, such as [Stop Deportación](https://twitter.com/Stopdeportacion) , have noted that these developments might especially affect those from Morocco and people from Senegal, often without translators and legal support\.
#### GERMANY
### Deportations continue, although some courts oppose them

While some of the charter flights to Kabul deporting people from the EU are organized by the EU border agency Frontex, Germany has continued organising their own deportation flights\. 
In their recent release, Pro Asyl warned that in spite of the pandemic and evidence for the situation in Afghanistan, a considerable number of interior ministers are still pushing for deportations to Afghanistan\. The group has recently called out the Robert Koch Institute to disclose why and how they came to a drastic change in assessment of the current conditions and safety situation of Afghanistan in such a short time since their last estimate that stated it was by no means a safe place\.


> The interior ministers of some federal states push through deportations with stoic indifference regardless of the situation\. 




Some deportations are stopped at the last minute by the courts, but many others aren’t, they say, explaining that it often depends on chance whether an Afghan who is arrested in a raid with the purpose of deportation can find legal support within such a short time\. In that case, they should be lucky enough to end up at a court that has the courage to withstand pressure from the interior ministers and to re\-open the case to stop the deportation at the last minute\.

989 people have been deported to Afghanistan since 2016\. Read more on deportations from Germany [here](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/30778/more-than-1-000-afghan-asylum-seekers-deported-from-germany?fbclid=IwAR2GEdA4cUVokJhRHdg8XOjx1yHryTDueGmqxYl9SZ2sveuFBCqXAU4R9Xw) \.

#### DENMARK
### An alarming reminder

As we reported earlier, Denmark has taken a very wrong–right \(wing\) turn in their migration policies\. Danish authorities ruled that the security situation around Damascus has improved, despite all the apparent evidence of ongoing suffering, dire living conditions, the fact that half of the country’s children have spent their lives in a war, and continued persecution by the regime\.

As a result of such a decision, the country has recently stripped
94 people under international protection of their right to stay in the country\. They have also recently introduced a proposal that would aim to move all asylum applicants outside Denmark\.
