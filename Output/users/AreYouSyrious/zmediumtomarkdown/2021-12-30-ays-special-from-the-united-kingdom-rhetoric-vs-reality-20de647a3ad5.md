### AYS Special from the United Kingdom: Rhetoric vs Reality

_In the fifth of our Winter Specials, our own Hannah Parry look at the situation for people on the move in the United Kingdom, with the Nationality and Border Bill looming over 2022\. Now set apart from the European Union, the UK has continued to calculate exactly what that means for people claiming asylum, whilst also failing those who are already caught in the complex system\._

[The Nationality and Borders Bil](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-nationality-and-borders-bill-factsheet/nationality-and-borders-bill-factsheet) l — a piece of legislation aimed at rewriting how the UK assesses not just asylum claims, but also how refugees are treated after their claims are accepted — was strongly opposed by [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/nationality-borders-bill-truth-behind-claims) , the [Joint Council of the Welfare of Immigrants](https://www.jcwi.org.uk/) and many other groups\. Even UNHCR criticised the Bill for undermining international human rights law\.


> **“UNHCR believes the UK’s Nationality and Borders Bill would penalise most refugees seeking asylum in the country, creating an asylum model that undermines established international refugee protection rules and practices\.” [UNHCR](https://www.unhcr.org/uk/uk-immigration-and-asylum-plans-some-questions-answered-by-unhcr.html)** 





The Bill, which successfully passed through the House of Commons in December, makes a distinction between those who arrive by small boats and trucks from mainland Europe and those arriving by other ways — for example those who have obtained a visa from their home country to visit the UK for another reason \(studying or holiday\) and claim asylum once here\. It also gives powers to remove those already granted citizenship from those born and brought up in the UK\.

Yet legal routes to entering the UK are now fewer than ever\. The Afghan Resettlement Scheme is [reportedly to open in January](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/afghan-citizens-resettlement-scheme-to-open-in-january) , months after Kabul fell to the Taliban in August\. Details have still not been released on how the scheme will actually work, but as things stand, the only way that someone from Afghanistan whose life is in danger can reach the UK is via boat or lorry, probably involving a human trafficker\. Family Reunion rules have also ceased to apply since Brexit took effect\. Dublin III, the agreement between EU member states, [no longer applies to the UK](https://www.gherson.com/blog/family-reunion-uk-post-brexit) \. This means that it is unclear how those already in the UK can apply for their family members to join them, as the measures in place only refer to applications made before Brexit happened\.

Relations with EU nations mean that cooperation over asylum matters is almost certainly off the cards\. Arguments with our French neighbours have led to threats of legal action by the government over fishing rights, and the heartless lack of reaction by both nations over the loss of 27 lives in November 2021 is resulting in continued tensions as well as legal action by the families of those who died\.
#### Waiting and more waiting

The conditions for those waiting for their asylum claim to be heard has remained slow\. With the pandemic cited as a reason for claims being processed so slowly, people are waiting months in restrictive hotel accommodation\. In 2020, [more than 30,000 people](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/2/uk-asylum-seeker-queue) had waited more than a year for their claim to be assessed\. Many of those people were affected by the Aspen card scandal\. The Aspen card is the payment card issued to asylum seekers and is how the government pays £39\.63 per week for food, clothes and household items\. In June 2021, [thousands were left without money](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jun/02/thousands-of-asylum-seekers-go-hungry-after-cash-card-problems) as the payment system was transferred to another provider\. Those left without support had to rely on charities or friends for a week or more to be able to eat while the system was sorted out\.

Right wing media continue to perpetrate the view that the UK is being ‘flooded’ with new arrivals\. This is not true\. The UK granted 13,210 asylum applications in 2021, compared with Germany’s 122,015\. Both of these figures are significantly lower than pre\-pandemic levels\. One reason cited for the growing animosity towards those arriving is that the number arriving by boat has risen\. Previously, most people came hidden on trucks via either a cross\-channel ferry or the Shuttle \(the underwater vehicle transport train\) \. Those arrivals would then travel onwards to different parts of the country before claiming asylum\. Now, people arriving on boats are much more visible to local communities, leading to the southern county of Kent receiving many more initial claims\.

In order to address the numbers arriving by boat, Home Secretary Priti Patel proposed a clause of the Nationality and Borders Bill that would [allow pushbacks at sea](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/09/09/priti-patel-sanctions-pushback-tactics-turn-away-migrant-boats/) \. The response to these shocking ideas by beloved volunteer lifeboat charity the RNLI was a heartening reminder of the views of so many British people\. The charity received thousands of pounds in support after Chief Executive Mark Dowie defended the need to save lives\.


> “Our charity exists to save lives at sea\. Our mission is to save every one, our lifesavers are compelled to go to those in need without judgement of how they came to be in the water\. They have done so since the RNLI was founded in 1824 and this will always be our ethos,” [RNLI statement](https://marineindustrynews.co.uk/rnli-issues-defiant-statement-regarding-migrant-rescues/) 




#### Life behind the numbers

For those caught in the asylum system, facts and figures matter far less than the reality they are faced with\. My friends had such firm hope and excitement for safely ending their dangerous journeys to find safety\. That excitement was quickly dashed by the realities\.

Abdullah is from Sudan and has been in the UK for over a year\. He spent nine months in a hotel on the edge of London where the same food was served to him day after day\. He didn’t receive an allowance because food was provided, so he had no choice over what to eat or when to eat it\. He had friends in London but without an allowance he relied on their kindness in order to pay for the bus to visit them\. Then, he was transferred to a city in the north of England\. Despite not knowing anyone there, Abdullah was still excited to advance to the next stage of the process\. Once again, the excitement was soon dashed\. The shared house he was moved to was dirty\. There was broken furniture, no internet and even some kind of bug infestation in the carpet\. With help from local people and organisations, he got curtains for the window and a desk to study at\.

Abdullah always makes friends easily, as he has done in his new city\. However, the endless waiting has taken a severe toll on his mental health\. Visiting friends in London or Birmingham has provided some relief, but he hasn’t stayed long\. He doesn’t want to miss an important letter sent to his home address\. He has no right to work or study\. His family in Sudan have waited years for him to arrive somewhere and he’s desperate to be able to send them money\. He had hoped to study, but now he just wants to get a job of any kind as soon as possible\. Through boredom and hopelessness, as well as previous trauma, he has turned to drinking\.

The Nationality and Borders Bill has yet to be debated in the House of Lords — there is still a slight hope that changes can be made that will reflect the compassion felt by so many British people towards those who seek help here\. Groups continue to campaign, fund\-raise and welcome people amidst the political turmoil\.
