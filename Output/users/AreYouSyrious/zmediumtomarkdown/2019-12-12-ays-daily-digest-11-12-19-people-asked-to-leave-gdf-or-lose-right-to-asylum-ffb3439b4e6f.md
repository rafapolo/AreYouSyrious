The [New Humanitarian reports](http://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/investigation/2019/12/10/UN-migrants-Libya-transit-centre-project) that UNHCR have been asking people to leave the Gathering and Departure Facility \(GDF\) as it currently has approximately 1,150 residents\. Many have entered informally having bribed their way in to escape the fighting\.


> A flyer UNHCR began distributing late November at the GDF ‚Äî seen by The New Humanitarian ‚Äî offers food, cash, primary healthcare, and medical referrals to those willing to leave\. 





> ‚ÄúYou will not be considered for evacuation or resettlement if you stay,‚Äù stresses the flyer ‚Äî the latest in a series of attempts to encourage those who entered informally to leave‚Ä¶ 





> A source within UNHCR Libya, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, criticised the effort to push people out, calling it tantamount to ‚Äúblackmail‚Äù to promise them help if they go and threaten their ability to secure refugee status if they do not\. 





> ‚ÄúAsylum seekers are asylum seekers and can‚Äôt be denied the right to seek asylum on the basis of their stay at the GDF,‚Äù they said, adding that the aid on offer had not included ‚Äúany future consideration for their protection needs or safety‚Äù once they leave\. 





The facility opened one year ago and was proposed by UNHCR\. It is believed to have cost $6 million and is co\-managed by the Libyan Ministry of Interior, UNHCR, and LibAid\. It is also the only centre we know of which has routinely reduced it‚Äôs capacity as conditions worsened\.


> last December UNHCR said the facility could hold 1,000 people, but that number was adjusted in subsequent statements ‚Äî in September, it was [700](https://reliefweb.int/report/libya/unhcr-update-libya-6-september-2019-enar) , and in October [600](https://reliefweb.int/report/libya/news-comment-jean-paul-cavalieri-unhcr-s-chief-mission-libya-situation-gathering-and) \. 





Libya currently ‚Äòhosts‚Äô around [600,000 refugees](https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/opinion/2019/04/18/help-migrants-and-refugees-libya-europe) but is not signed up to the international refugee convention and while UNHCR states that Libyan authorities have promised to recognise documentation handed out by them to those who choose to leave the GDF, it has been repeatedly shown that, due to the current civil war, there is no guarantee of this happening\. UNHCR has also stated that it will leave the centre altogether if conditions do not improve, yet their continued collaboration with both Libyan authorities and militias undermines their stance\. They have reportedly received [over 47 million Euros](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/10/10/libya-migrants-un-iom-refugees-die-detention-center-civil-war/) from the EU initiative, Trust Fund for Africa, since 2016\. This initiative is focussed on curbing migration to Europe while the EU also trains and funds the Libyan Coast Guard who deliberately return people to what has repeatedly been called the ‚Äòhell‚Äô of Libya\.


> In general, people who are rescued at sea or on vessels intercepted by the Libyan Coast Guard are assigned to detention centers in Tripoli or in coastal cities, although in recent months some were allowed to leave upon disembarkation at Libyan ports, due to lack of space in detention or other reasons\. ‚Äî [Caroline Gluck, Senior External Relations Officer at UNHCR Libya](https://specialelibia.it/2019/12/11/unhcr-libya-caroline-gluck-gdf-in-tripoli-is-massively-overcrowded/) 





Unfortunately UNHCR remain as confused as ever‚Ä¶

It's a human rights thing. #StandUp4HumanRights https://t.co/OBRVHkugl8

Why can‚Äôt refugees be sent back to Libya? It‚Äôs a human rights thing‚Ä¶

**GREECE**

**UNICEF Report**

A new [report by UNICEF](https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/72850.pdf) states that there are approximately 34,000 refugee children in Greece, 12,892 of whom arrived between January and September this year, a 50% increase on the same time period last year\. At least 4,616 of these children are unaccompanied\. Over 10,000 of these children live in diabolical conditions on the islands\.


> While living conditions and access to basic services for refugees and migrants have improved on the mainland, reception capacity and service provision on the Greek islands is still characterized by overcrowding and increasing risks of violence and abuse, including gender\-based violence \(GBV\) ‚Äî a situation confirmed by a UNICEF\-supported study1 on accessibility and barriers to GBV services for refugees and migrants\. The study revealed challenges that include an overly complex referral system, limited interpretation and intercultural mediation, lack of adequate psychological support and services for child and male survivors of GBV\. At the same time, the report notes a significant increase in disclosures by survivors in locations where support services are present and where information for survivors is provided consistently\.

**Germany offers aid but refuses to relocate refugees**

According to [Info Migrant](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/21463/germany-sends-aid-to-greece?fbclid=IwAR00uonXcEDestZrU_AX8IFXskHMxnkOlX_bFNNOuhiCYsNbGzF7WgY6Koc) s there are currently over 100,000 refugees in Greece\. In response Germany has sent goods worth 1\.5 million euros to temporarily support 10,000 asylum seekers, but has refused to relocate anyone\. It is clear from the ground that this is an inadequate response which provides no long\-term solution to what is an increasingly dangerous situation for people forced to remain in Greece\.

**CROATIA**

[A very concerning article](http://www.h-alter.org/vijesti/garaze-podrumi-koridori?fbclid=IwAR2af4J3PkSSuXuMRn9Lp_6VRp94rjVQjQTFifhxjTG819ceRVm_yL0gWn4) has been compiled on the detention of people on the move, including children, in windowless cells, garages and basements in several different police stations in Croatia\. During these detentions people report being given no food or water and not being allowed access to a toilet\. There is often only floor space for people to sit on even though it is winter\. This is often combined with severe beatings, the theft of personal items, the forced signing of documents without translation and illegal pushbacks\.

**BOSNIA**

Racism in Tuzla‚Äôs [Bingo City Centre](https://web.facebook.com/gdjezeljeozive/?ref=gs&__tn__=%2CdK-R-R&eid=ARBlaPT7ePTsNBHPXcj5ACGUeWXJkCJ4FXXyAl3MW8yGaXgEoDqPk8NkxaUvuTqk0lmwky6vhuzd7FKK&fref=gs&dti=2379336965459224&hc_location=group)

[Reports from the ground](https://web.facebook.com/groups/2379336965459224/permalink/2729374973788753/) state that people have been asked to leave the largest shopping Centre in Tuzla due to racial discrimination\.


> Refugees without documents \( those people who have just a registration paper\) are not allowed to enter there\. Especially young men who have darker skin color\. 
 

> One of our volunteers was at Brunswick Bowling with three boys today at that center\. Security came , escorted them out and told them that refugees are not allowed to be there‚õîÔ∏è 





The shopping centre houses many popular brands including Zara, Lindex, Bershka, Waikiki, Pull&Bear, Tom Tailor, S\.Oliver, and Terranova\. Feel free to ask your local stores for more details‚Ä¶
