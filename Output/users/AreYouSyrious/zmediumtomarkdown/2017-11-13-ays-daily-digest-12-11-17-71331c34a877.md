### AYS Daily Digest 12\.11\.17: No, the Greek border will not be opened\. Do not inspire false hope in refugees\!

#### Feature

Desperate people are often very excited to hear some good news, and sometimes this desire spills over into gullibility\.

Rumors are once again being circulated that the Greek border will be opened soon, prompting some to make the journey to be among those lucky enough to get through\. The call is spread over the FB and people are invited to come to Thessaloniki on November 15th, and start walking toward the Macedonian border\.

Unfortunately, as has been the case every other time that such rumors have spread, there is no truth to this wishful thinking\. The border is closed and will remain closed in the foreseeable future, and a mass pilgrimage to the north will only result in injuries for the refugees\. A previous attempt to march north ended in tragedy, with two refugees drowning and many more being hurt\. Be an active voice against misinformation, save lives\!
#### Syria

### Turkish Coastguard attacks refugee boat

A video shot on November 10 shows the Turkish coastguard’s shocking disregard for human life as they harass and allegedly fire shots at a refugee boat\. Once a Greek coastguard boat appeared, 17 refugees jumped off the boat and swam towards the Greeks\. The remaining people who were unable to swim were returned to Turkey\.

### Police arrest hunger striker

The man in question is Hesam Shaeri Hesari, and he was arrested two nights ago in Mytilene\. He is currently in Moria pending deportation\. Hesam has said that if he were deported, he would set himself on fire\. A refugee from Iran, Hesam claims to be persecuted for religious reasons, and a return to Iran would prove dangerous to his life\. There will be a demonstration against this injustice on November 14 outside of Moria camp\.
### Acharnon 22 squat is a safe space for pregnant woman and young mothers

#### Austria
### Rally against far\-right extremism to take place on Wednesday

In Ballhaus Square in Vienna, SOS Mitmensch plans to hold a demonstration against the rising tide of xenophobic far\-right wing ideology in Austria\. The demonstration is set to begin at 6:30PM and participants are asked to bring with them blinkers, bicycle lights, phones with functional flashlights, and other portable light sources with them\. The plan is to create a human chain around the government district in Vienna to symbolically keep the far\-right away from power\.
#### Poland
### Fascist manifestations in Poland frighten onlookers

Brave people, led by group of woman, tried to stop fascist marching in Warsaw to celebrate Independence Day\.

Tens of thousands of far\-right wing activists and their supporters gathered in Warsaw, bearing torches and calling for an ethnically homogeneous Europe with “clean blood,” free of Muslims and Jews\. Even more disturbingly, there were signs at the march calling for a “Muslim Holocaust”\.

The police estimate that around 60,000 demonstrators took part in the march\. The march was organized by a group calling itself the National Radical Camp\. It is worth noting that there existed a fascist movement in Poland by the same name in the 1930s\. [According to the WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/polish-nationalist-youth-march-draws-thousands-in-capital-1510429006) , even though many in the Warsaw municipal government were uncomfortable with the march and what the organizers stood for, they had no choice but to approve the gathering as it constitutes a “ celebration of Polish history\.” A counter demonstration took place against the normalization of fascism in Polish society, but their numbers were dwarfed by the demonstration, a worrying sign of the times\.
#### Italy

[The Italy Refugee Crisis Database](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1834254390190027/?hc_location=ufi) compiles a list of those refugees who lost their lives in recent periods, a task that would otherwise prove extremely difficult\.
