### AYS News Digest 2/11/22: Suspicions lie behind the management of immigration in the UK

UK asylum seekers live in poor conditions in Manston while Home Secretary called for ‘invasion’// A dozen people missing on the Aegean// Belgrade — crucial but hostile layover on the Balkan route//Minors living under bridge for months in Paris// €100 million to countries hosting \(Ukrainian\) refugees// and more

#### FEATURE

Rishi Sunak, the UK Prime Minister, has repeatedly claimed that British reception should be based on compassion\. At the heart of the British immigration management, however, there seems to be a policy of suspicion\.

The suspicion goes hand in hand with selective work at the country’s borders\. The possibility of legal or non\-legal access to the UK is based on a long line of demonstrations of the danger experienced by the asylum seeker, as the story told in this thread demonstrates\.


■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 
> **[MigrantsLawProject](https://twitter.com/MigrantsLawProj) @ Twitter Says:** 

> > The MLP is thrilled that we have managed to reunite Yonas (not real names), a young refugee who was trapped in Libya, with his brother, Abel, a refugee in the UK. This is the first time we have found a lawful route out of Libya. A thread: 

> **Tweeted at [2022-11-02 09:43:00](https://twitter.com/migrantslawproj/status/1587742060311887874).** 

■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 


But even once the risk situation experienced has been highlighted and demonstrated, that seems to be insufficient\.

As said by Migrant Law Project in a tweet:


> “According to the Home Office, their \(people stuck in Libya\) situation is not exceptional since all ‘migrants’ face the same dangers in Libya\. To try the lawful route, a person needs to have a lawyer and be prepared to stay in a high\-risk environment whilst the legal process takes its course”\. 




And mistrust of asylum seekers grows stronger in specific countries\. Depending on the country of origin, protection seems to be more or less of a right\. Thus particular groups arriving in the UK are regardless seen as less needy, as in the case of people from Albania, who increasingly cross the Channel, risking their lives\.


> “They \(Albanians\) are not welcome and should not expect to stay”\. 





Stated Home Secretary Suella Braverman\. Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, had this to say:


> “There has been a large increase in the number of people from Albania seeking asylum in the UK\. It is important that we do not assume that because a country is not in conflict that these are not valid claims”\.

No visas\. No regular access\. And once they arrive, risking their lives: No reception\. Overcrowding at the Manston centre is inflaming the political debate these days\. Between the organisations and people who denounced the situation, Soas Detainee Support\. Here is their thread about the Manston centre:

Yet as is often the case, the problem is not analysed with a self\-critical eye\. [‘Invasion’](https://apnews.com/article/british-politics-immigration-migration-europe-english-channel-6f72588f2685a1154b3eca633fe3ef66?fbclid=IwAR1ReBy31ab_BowfPkQQGwpPHl6js-tSLNYYgXd3aKvfvRgJ9jiKlAvz7nc) , said Home Secretary, Suella Braverman \( [read more in this article](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/01/an-invasion-suella-braverman-refugee-crisis-governments-own-making?fbclid=IwAR0XSE8vfcQ0K-saNA7t78KpJYH3xMTQ80BvrcW6j1beaBo14mw74yooCOQ) \) \. Speaking of invasion, the possibility that the overcrowding is due to a wider structural problem inherent in the overall management of the asylum system has not been considered\.

Braverman recently proposed that child asylum seekers must be x\-rayed to prove their own truth\. Again, suspicion seems to prevail over a welcome\.

#### GREECE
### Many people in search of protection are missing on the Aegean Sea

Dozens of people [are missing](https://www.rfi.fr/en/international/20221101-dozens-missing-as-migrant-boats-capsize-between-turkey-and-greece-in-high-winds?fbclid=IwAR00m-AylwnXnPOWfKJxOqH6wvIdvqXRZLVfgMNTm77vew-8el-dVpU5XKE) after a boat started sinking in the Kafireas Strait between the islands of Evia and Andros\. About 68 people from Afghanistan, Iran and Egypt were travelling in search of safety\. On Tuesday the Greek coast guard was alerted about a boat with people in distress, but they were not able to reach them immediately because the location was not known, according to the authorities\.

Since the beginning of the year, almost 300 people have died on the Aegean Sea, according to Greek newspaper _Ekathimerini\._

#### SERBIA
### Belgrade — a crucial but hostile layover on the Balkan route

InfoMigrants has published a story about people who stop or get stuck in Serbia on their way towards the West\.


> For the migrants who have chosen to cross Serbia rather than Bosnia, another country along the Balkan route, Belgrade is a necessary layover city because of its central location\. Taxis or buses coming up from the south stop at the capital, while others go north toward the Hungarian and Romanian borders\. The layover allows migrants to pause from their journey for a few days and plan the rest of their trip\. 





> “The police come for us at night, so we return here\. At the station, they leave us alone\.” It is impossible for young Moroccans to find refuge inside the station: The door to the imposing yellow building, which the municipality wishes to transform into a museum, is kept locked\.

#### FRANCE
### Around 200 minors continue to live in poor conditions under a bridge in Paris

First of all their truth, their word was denied\. Minors are being told they are not minors\. Around 200 people are living under a bridge in a suburb of Paris, close to the connection between a freeway and the highway\. Far from everything\.

Most of them are young people, minors\. After living a while at a camp, they were denied the status of minors, so that now they are under appeal at the court\.

Having no place to shelter, more and more young people went to live in Place de la Bastille, where Utopia56 was supporting them\. Persecuted by the authorities they had to go to a more hidden spot\. Far from sight\. Far from the life a minor should be living\.


> “ I would like to play sports, but without a shower, it bothers me”, 





said a young man living in the makeshift tent camp at Le Blondy Blog\.

The rejection of their younger age is first of all a rejection of their bodies, but it is linked to a more general rejection of their sociality, of their social being\.

Having no access to water, electricity, a decent life is synonymous with having no access to school, friends and a normal life\.


> “Besides, it’s funny, did you know we are under the Nelson Mandela Bridge?” 





said Carlos, a young man living in the informal settlement, who talked with Le Bondy Blog\.

Twelve women and 28 children from Kurdish\-run detention camps in northern Syria will soon be repatriated, according to the Dutch government\. Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra and Justice Minister Dilan Yesilgoz\-Zegerius stated that after transferring the 12 Dutch women, suspected of terrorist offenses, and their children, the women will be arrested upon arrival in the country and will be tried\.

#### SWEDEN
### Rights of refugees at risk with new Swedish government

New proposals are coming from the Swedish government in the field of migration\. This includes the creation of transit zones to assess the reality of a refugee’s claim to protection\. Added to this is a change in legislation that would decrease the possibility of permanent residence permits, with shorter temporary permits\.

### A family of five was to be deported to Greece, as reported by the local activists

Their case will [reportedly](https://www.visir.is/g/20222269146d) be in the court on 18 November\.


> We are trying to gather a group of people who can stand outside their house in Norðurhella 15, Hafnarfjörður\. There are apparently quite a lot of police outside their house\. 





> Currently there are ongoing mass arrests of people facing deportations, many of whom are waiting for their cases to be reopened following a recent court decision that may set a precedent\. 





> Their lawyers are calling on the authorities to postpone the deportation process to allow the cases to be legally resolved by the Appeals Board\. 





> So far the police, ÚTL and the Ministry of Justice have only responded with violence\!

### €100 million to countries hosting \(Ukrainian\) refugees

The European Commission committed up to €400 million to “support refugees from Ukraine in the most affected Member States”, and now they have made available a further €100 million to seven Member States that have been hosting large numbers of refugees\. From Ukraine, of course\.

As the report says:


> These funds can be used for offering immediate assistance to refugees, such as food, transport, temporary accommodation, and integrating refugees, especially the vulnerable ones, such as unaccompanied minors\. 





> The remaining €52 million will be channeled at a later stage towards emerging needs, such as accommodation projects, providing quality psychological first aid, [mental health](https://euneighbourseast.eu/mentalhealth/) and psychosocial support to persons fleeing Ukraine\.
