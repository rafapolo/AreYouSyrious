[Solidarité migrants Wilson](https://www.facebook.com/Solidarit%C3%A9-migrants-Wilson-598228360377940/?__tn__=%2CdkCH-R-R&eid=ARDPPpyvCjDlnnvd7Wtdy5BJzqJ3lzSVpBJ1sIOZEL13xbww4MgRkPz77demcJmskUKhA-63YtLVphOv&hc_ref=ARSrnlzGfmDOF8OhZwckyg3MWZespOquEmP3-7BY-E0YbudM-rsLI4u5RBPUMof_xjw&fref=nf) team writes about groups of refugees around the streets with no tents or blankets, in the rain\. Some have only small jackets with no hoodies\. You can only see silhouettes running, trying to find shelter\. No fire to gather around and rarely someone who has managed to get food to eat\.

People taken to ‘shelters’ the previous week are already back in the streets, says the group\. Those who were present at the evacuations were taken in unknown directions\.


> Concretely, there are a lot of centers and it is really difficult to know where the people were taken, what condition they are in at those places\. Some of the news that we hear suggests that some centers are very insecure\. More precisely, a certain number of places have no budget for food\. So, in some places the refugees are not even provided with food, which is incredible\!
 

> The police are everywhere, for what purpose and to protect whom? 





For months, they have been removing everyone and everything that looks like they could be refugee\-related in the suburbs, in Saint\-Denis in particular, volunteers say:


> Is it just so that the streets of the capital are pretty, and are we cleaning Paris as we do the Mediterranean? 



#### GREECE
### Raising the question of refugee women’s choice

A meeting between the Secretary General for Gender Equality, Fotini Kouvela, and the president of the “MOV” feminist collective was organized to focus on the issues that have arisen in the Aegean islands with refugees, as media have [reported](https://left.gr/news/synantisi-tis-f-koyvela-me-ti-sissy-vovoy-gia-dikaioma-olon-ton-gynaikon-sti-diakopi-kyisis?fbclid=IwAR1AaIoYI_C3KV1neuoND0BDF9tlVxBtdMGHspt_bUnEQyzSk37WlgtKIfQ) \.

The meeting once again raised the controversial issue of the refusal of some doctors at public hospitals on the Aegean islands and refugee populations to terminate pregnancies, when the pregnancy is the result of rape, by invoking the moral conscience, according to paragraph 1 of article 31 of Law 3418/2005 \(Code of Medical Ethics\) \.

At the meeting there was focus on the provisions of the Article protecting the free development of the individual personality in general, also protecting all the individual rights such as physical freedom, honor, health, but there are also certain caveats\. One such caveat is the mother’s choice, where the law permits such a conditional choice\.
### The question of citizenship for newborn children

[Mobile Info Team For Refugees In Greece](https://www.facebook.com/mobileinfoteam/?__tn__=%2CdkCH-R-R&eid=ARCnTes6L87fX65x15nGF9oY-_yPEaCNspwsWnv_t6ufzS8Te-vMjUlPWbGOEafASB7LnAYffiZjxkXh&hc_ref=ARRgExgCK6bBel3g8K8PAIFcbNWukRtP0tij_QHtJRG_AZLJqPYLsA_ImgReWgrB-Ww&fref=nf) reports: The concept that a baby born in a country will automatically become a citizen is quite common on the American continent\. In Europe no country has what is called birthright citizenship\. In Greece a newborn baby will receive the status of its parents\. If the parents are asylum seekers, the baby will be included in the asylum application of the parents, after the baby and the birth certificate are presented to the Asylum Office\. If the parents have already been granted asylum status, the baby will receive the same status as they have\.
### Minors riot in Fylakio

Police filed a case file for arson, disruption of the peace, and disaster damage against 14 people after a riot on Monday morning at the Reception and Identification Center in Fylakio Orestiada, when a group of unaccompanied refugees damaged a wing of the Center building\. In particular, minors trashed and set fire to the ward where they had been detained, demanding resettlement to camps on the mainland\.
The minors complain that despite the fact that their identification process has been completed — within 25 days of their arrival — they are being held as prisoners in Fylakio in northern Evros for two or three months\.
The incident ended with intervention of the police and the fire brigade\.
This is the third such riot to occur recently\.
### Workshop for job seekers

### Racist winds blow in the Eternal City

As we [reported yesterday](ays-daily-digest-05-02-2019-local-authorities-in-bosnia-demand-state-institutions-to-lift-ioms-af159fce1ff8) , the police took 11 young refugees off the street for no obvious reason or justification\. 
“Yet another intervention, the only effect \(now clearly targeted\) being humiliating and generating frustration in those who are already in a condition of vulnerability”, say the volunteers of [Baobab Experience](https://www.facebook.com/BaobabExperience/?__tn__=%2CdkCH-R-R&eid=ARDNBhcig7v2EnytQdpahO2zKrMJL47Zm4boTkgc6KhXRkxx1MYe8Nh2XfsWgg2ab6efWYNuVAoxnV2h&hc_ref=ARQmh1b-rvg1JkfIRItNpvC29DjVDckZk36OcPv0fkhdlViteCeKGdwn-G-gfPBMV2I&fref=nf&hc_location=group) the next day\.


> We are asking all people and everyone living in Rome if this is the city they want, one they feel part of\.
 

> Has the capital, after almost 2,800 years, become a place where those who are foreign are persecuted, made to feel unwanted, humiliated\.
 

> What has been happening at Piazzale Spadolini is just a part of this air, now unbreathable, a racist wind that cannot be part of Rome; it is also shown in the continuous searches and identifications that occur daily on public transport and only target foreigners\.

### San Ferdinando, Reggio Calabria

[Comitato Lavoratori delle Campagne](https://www.facebook.com/comitatolavoratoridellecampagne/?__tn__=%2CdkCH-R-R&eid=ARCl8jqgU7FcDf9dQimCjcDvnYgmAGqi0R1CpaH-9ej7uTzE-mA5CVBTMpmjX2JbqCLYrL6QgmqaTAjm&hc_ref=ARQPieH6jyBx09CXIfqeLPbwBSgMdZ93ndRQrDDuiCiwqCWVw-OoXQctRNhM6hp4Uhg&fref=nf) reports that the refugees who live and work at the provisional campsite and who have previously complained about the situation and the vague statements producing no results after many interofficial meetings, were threatened by some of the very officials who came and spoke to six people, of whom they do not know five, attacking them with questions like: “Who sent you to protest? Who do you work for? What do you people from ‘tendopoli’ want? 
There are six new buildings, built with EU funds and precisely for the immigrants workers, which can accommodate 250 people, but nobody seems to speak about that, writes the Comitato team\.

### Dunkirk

The [Refugee Women’s Cent](https://www.facebook.com/refugeewomenscentre/?__tn__=%2CdkCH-R-R&eid=ARAk87mhWDpJdUMp2cPDagEFgjp-2148LD7UpeyWerzJAhS7M7pwAMNy4bXogt7z9uMA-3J-wKao4IhT&hc_ref=ARSa7_jBH7btyOTdyIkLtFSNaPr7VGt7G4B3c8uIZOPnot7y5cbYHsvDxvKDAvVwv3U&fref=nf) er facilitates activities twice a week in Grande\-Synthe and every Friday in Calais\.


> Often during these sessions, when people are feeling the most at ease in a safe and private space, we hear about the traumas people have experienced and continue to undergo and people’s future concerns\. It is then our role to refer the people as appropriate, whether it be for legal support, supporting political action, or for psychological support\. 




### Diplo\-docus / Migrations / L’aquarius : et maintenant ?

On Friday, 8 February at 18h, a debate will take place at Café Associatif \(La Croisée des Drailles in Saint\-Disdier\-en\-Dévoluy\) with one of the crew members of the Aquarius\. tThe debate aims to spark discussion about what can be done next, to share the experiences that had happened on board the Aquarius, and initiate possible future activities\.

#### SPAIN

Proactiva Open Arms and Maritime Humanitarian Rescue have collected almost 140,000 signatures for the government to allow the Aita Mari and the Open Arms to leave the sea, as they have been blocked in Spanish ports since January\. This initiative, which began two weeks ago through the [Change\.org](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2FChange.org%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR3eZoQMhHBaWlw83w5OfMbMogCeOMAe0roTmWtrps5HWIywla24SeT1ABw&h=AT2wcwZyJlLvP_c8ZU2Rcyhj8LfOnIL6Vygb4APR5iFDN25B1SkqRXw6czVzPW6CNI3fUYItA7-DFcS8crUhsgZM1AhRdT92pGgZJ6julMTwcANGjcCBR0FkkmPIyU_9OoUiLqS_etqnQ7pluio) platform, aims to cast light on the fact that the Central Mediterranean “is still the deadliest route in the world,” and calls on the executive branch to re\-think immigration policy\.

The organizations will deliver Congress the signatures they have collected, with which they denounce **blocking civil society that tries to respond “to the cry for help from hundreds of people\.”**
#### SEA


> 332 people\.
 

> This is the number of people who have drowned in the Mediterranean as a result of the blockade of rescue ships this month\. These people could have been saved by vessels such as the Open Arms, the Aita Maria, the Sea Watch 3, or the Iuventa\. Because the Sea Watch 3 has been blocked in Catania for a few days, Open Arms has been calling for its release since 8 January, and for the Aita Mari since 18 January\. The winds in Spain seem to have shifted, something that has never happened in this ‘migration\-open’ country\. Technical reasons have also been given here, though the Open Arms is well\-equipped, and this is obviously an excuse\. The ships have been blocked for political reasons\. This is why many members in Madrid and celebrities worldwide are demanding that the Open Arms can finally be allowed back to sea\.
 

> At the same time, Madrid is cutting funds for its official rescue mission between Morocco and Spain and this is demonstrably wrong\.
 

> So, while ships remain blocked for purely political reasons to secure the fortress of Europe, the ticker, the Proactiva Open Arms has been set up to hold the people who died due to the blockade in the moat…
 

> The dying must finally stop\! We demand: the ambulances must be released immediately\!
