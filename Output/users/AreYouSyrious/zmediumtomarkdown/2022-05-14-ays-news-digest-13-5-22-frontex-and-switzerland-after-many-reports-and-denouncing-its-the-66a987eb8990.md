### AYS News Digest 13/5/22: Frontex and Switzerland — After many reports and denouncements, it’s the whistleblowers who raise the concern

#### FEATURE

Fearing that the country may end up being an accomplice in unlawful actions, a Swiss border guard who served in around 10 Frontex operations has said he will vote “no” in the upcoming referendum on whether or not to increase the Swiss funding of Frontex\.

**“Frontex does not work as it should”**

He [reportedly](https://www.statewatch.org/news/2022/may/former-frontex-officer-pledges-to-vote-no-in-referendum-on-swiss-funding-for-the-agency/?fbclid=IwAR1cfGqxXZbH4xIcK-8suj5PQnjdR7RcCapBrBGpvin0I39x9F-fKFmTnnM) witnessed a number of irregularities on his deployments with Frontex, including violence against people on the move seeking to leave Greece for other EU member states, and a colleague telling him he had accepted a bribe from a people smuggler\.

Citing a lack of overseeing missions, arbitrary following of rules and human rights standards, and individual cases of collaboration with smugglers, along with the widely known deprivation of freedom and human rights in the case of asylum seekers, the man in question decided to leave the agency\.

**Will the Swiss people follow his lead? —** We will find out after the national referendum this Sunday, May 15\.

#### GREECE
### Pushbacks \(even\) of the political asylum seekers

Many Kurdish asylum seekers are now being forced back to Turkey during pushbacks before even being given a chance to apply for asylum upon arrival in Greece\. Among them is the Kurdish writer Meral Simsek who claims she was sent back to Turkey only to face imprisonment after having crossed the Evros river\.


> “The vehicle smelled of blood and urine, indicating that other people had been abused in there,” 




she told news agency AFP, adding that she was then forced to get onto a dinghy which was piloted by two migrant men who “intended to drown” her, InfoMigrants [retells](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/40492/greece-accused-of-pushing-back-turkish-activists-seeking-asylum?fbclid=IwAR3C0JQECfuhqjY_KqyJrh5mmypsgnGHnJm-LELyygDc_H8ssd46ldadjNM) the account\.
### “Severe rule of law issues, poor methodology and sheer incompetence”

In an embarrassing data breach, the authorities had to hide the recently published “investigation [report](https://aead.gr/en/publications-en/essays-en/investigation-report-om-2022) of the Migration\-Nationality Subsector of the Sector of Local Authorities \(A’ & B’ Grade\), Decentralized Administration and Migration\-Nationality of the Inspections and Audits Unit of the National Transparency Authority” as it failed to properly hide the names and personal details of those who were interviewed during the investigation\.

“The disclosure of personal data and failed effort at redaction has left us with concerns over the conduct of the investigation,” said Lighthouse Reports Director Klaas van Dijken, whose phone number was included at the bottom of supposedly confidential correspondence, as one of the many breaches of privacy\.

The EAD survey was conducted in March 2022 on the occasion [of the publications](https://www.lighthousereports.nl/shadow-armies-uncovered/) of Spiegel and Lighthouse Reports on the relaunches taking place in Greece and Croatia\.

Those investigating the report also [note](https://omniatv.com/853473814?fbclid=IwAR2P30iEzwsIWgZJm7rgu3Adp6TGCdMdDA0f2QDAwC8WWnnLxVaEqLz7NCk) that it is interesting that the so\-called independent authority asked the Directorate of Criminological Investigations of the Hellenic Police to analyse the audiovisual material provided by the journalists who published the research\.

Speaking on preserving the identity, privacy and rights of those we claim to be protecting, the [Aegean Boat Report \(ABR\) posed a question](https://aegeanboatreport.com/2022/05/12/does-unhcr-enable-the-torture-of-refugees-by-greek-police/?fbclid=IwAR2H29GZcAQF7EeK8ot5Xh_mBy3ZZnSLrfV3G_bT4zllSYLSqhodnB-_c0s) regarding the UNCHR’s involvement when it comes to the relationship between the authorities and people who are counting on their support and protection:


> UNHCR has consistently and strongly criticised the Greek government and its uniformed officers for their barbaric, illegal, pushbacks against people who arrive in Greece\. 





> So why does UNHCR Greece hand the same authorities details about the locations of those men, women and children?

Continuing with the practice of focusing solely on securitisation and violent protection of borders, the very basics for human living are being neglected\.

#### BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
### Velika Kladuša

_“Now even the Bosnian police has become a problem for the guys on the Balkan route, who no longer have peace\. Some of them managed to stay in Velika Kladusa hiding in abandoned houses, but early yesterday morning while they were sleeping, they received an unexpected visit from the police who took them and put them on the bus to Lipa\. And once this is done, everything else is set on fire\. Food, blankets, curtains, fur bags, everything\. The stoves that the boys use to cook were also destroyed\. But the thing is, they don’t give up\. Nah guys never do this\. Many have escaped from Lipa and arrived in Kladusa to go to the game\. But there’s nothing left for them\. And they need to eat, to be able to live a few days and get back to the game\. Or they just need to fill as much food as they can in that loyal friend called backpack\. To be able to have something to eat in 15–20 days of walking,”_ B\. Bertochi reported\.

They have already been at sea for 4 days and meanwhile have neither drinking water nor food\. In fact, Maltese authorities are responsible for rescuing people from distress at sea in their search and rescue zone, but time and time again **Malta** disregards this responsibility\.

In **Italy** , another landing was [reported](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.grandangoloagrigento.it%2Fprimo-piano%2Fancora-uno-sbarco-a-lampedusa-quasi-1000-migranti-in-4-giorni%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2q5vGKrw2i9MTDFn1UlVVcUoPj1WvTuEr-rExknaau9qY_hyS8S7KBMVA&h=AT1EhhoSjdR6sEWUZPKcsmmuzdVAB9plwj2a-E6E-JLkJxVaR9MQXLHQrAabz3agUZHt1_ZcW1J27Z2i6oOIfVCTEXKw7zuc-WwDQiNBpp68NdL1s9jD1M1v80HVovojlm6VJb7vkUxPxdubKtwlJ3__4xwWnA&__tn__=R]-R&c[0]=AT3125vSjmrvU6oQaGPpA7j7lJk6N4N6wrw79z6yrWoza6-uIhdrGwnnbHGKcA6U0SCbdJxCM39ZLRywhbU0eHME09X507QHxH0CR9HCQ7GTs2SZw2ExLa0Q5WNDtCJKKvL19H-LvkPVRfyO1D1giBdCjj2T63WY7hccVvG6zHkWwSk9ID9Vbb1pmuXCKv4SpeF_Q6OljkgNgEfhfwo) in Lampedusa, with almost 1000 people arriving in 4 days\.

Salvamento Marítimo saved 15 people at sea in the early hours of Friday, May 13 off the coast of **Spain** \. One person in the group, however, was found dead during that mission\.

### Volunteers report from the Ceuta Circle of Silence

NNK volunteers in Ceuta write:


> In Ceuta, the Circle of Silence has been going on since 2015\. For 7 years, people have not stopped gathering every second Wednesday of the month, at 19:30, in Plaza de la Constitucion, to fight against the constant violations of migrants’ rights\. 





> As the name suggests, during the action the participants form a circle and remain silent for the agreed time\. At the beginning of each circle, a presentation is made and a communiqué is read out denouncing current situations\. 





> Unfortunately, in Ceuta, there are many violations to denounce every month: the violence of the border, of the institutions, the precariousness of the life of migrants, the constant uncertainty, the violations of the rights of minors, the discrimination, the institutional and non\-institutional racism, etc\.
