#### FEATURE: Thursday is set to see the largest number of people deported to Mauritania from Spain

As has happened on previous flights, deported people will not only be from that country but from Mali or Senegal\.” Photo from [Irene Ruano Blanco](https://twitter.com/irene_r_b/status/1227242368790753281)](assets/c8f8e006d880/1*WHuH0S3UPhsD8Kbwjhm_fA.jpeg)

Due of an agreement from 2003, between Spain and Mauritania, that Mauritania would accept back third party citizens if they traveled through the country in order to get to Spain, deportations to Mauritania are ongoing under dubious circumstances\.

In some cases it has not been verified that the people ever transited through Mauritania\. Some people who will be deported on Thursday are from Mali and Senegal, like previous deportations\.

_“In these deportations the deportation of people from Mali, a country in conflict, has been detected, without considering that many of them showed their intention to apply for asylum for this reason and in contravention of the principle of non\-refoulement\.”_ More [here](https://twitter.com/irene_r_b/status/1227242376256602120) \.

Here in [The Migration Newsroom](https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/international/110220/emprisonnes-tortures-le-sort-d-exiles-soudanais-rejetes-par-l-europe) in depth reporting, coming alongside the news on Tuesday that Sudan’s president agreed that Omar al\-Bashir should face trial at the ICC: _“Following an investigation between Europe and Sudan, Mediapart and its partners in the collective The Migration Newsroom have found traces of Sudanese exiles expelled from France, the Netherlands or Italy\. All of them relate the threats suffered on their return, even the torture\. What question the privileged relations maintained by several EU states with the dictatorship\.”_

#### SEARCH AND RESCUE AT SEA

91 people reported missing/drowned in the Med according to Alarm Phone on Monday\. This is an ongoing story, but new evidence brings hope that it is not the case:


![**“Following data, sources the so\-called ‘91’ Alarm Phone should be among the landed in Malta\. The CCRs of Rome and Malta are silent, institutional switchboards off, Libya is a black hole even if full of fakes\. \(and the reporter asks for clemency, after the sleepless nights behind this chaos\)”** Photo by [Sergio Scandura](https://twitter.com/scandura/status/1227218818919010304)](assets/c8f8e006d880/1*QewiDSHKnTHunCu23PIafw.jpeg)

Some more relieving news:

> > @[guardiacostiera](https://twitter.com/guardiacostiera) We can confirm the rescue of 20 people to #Lampedusa. They travelled all the way into the Italian #SAR zone because both #Malta &amp; #Italy failed to rescue them for hours despite being repeatedly alerted by us. This case could have ended in tragedy due to European non-assistance.

In an update by Despoina Kotsouba \(shared by [Jenny Zinovia Kali](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1508309029486384/permalink/2482269482090329/) \):
#### The Greek government is about to deport a Syrian family of 7 who reside in Chios


> “The Minister of Immigration and Asylum has told [efsyn\.gr](https://www.efsyn.gr/node/230555) that he is going to deport a Syrian family with the approval of the European Court of Human Rights \(ECtHR\) \. The Minister fails to report that the family’s asylum application is being reviewed by the competent asylum service in the light of new critical elements not considered by the ECtHR\. Shocking and outrageous is the public position of the minister responsible for a case being examined by the ‘independent’ asylum service\. 





> Therefore, the family is really at risk because political leadership intervenes and makes the decision for the competent services\. **It is a family of Syrians with 5 minor children, war refugees who have multiple and well\-established health problems** and reside in Chios\. They are at immediate risk of deportation\. The minister’s practices of deporting refugees following determined procedures are illegal and exacerbate any notion of humanity\. State officials must perform their duties and rule on asylum cases in accordance with the results of a fair process and not with the individual aspirations of political leadership\. **We can all make the case known and STOP this crime”** 





An asylum seeker from Senegal had his case rejected in a 5 minute interview, simply because it was assumed he knew French when he only knew Wolof \(his mother tongue — widely spoken in Senegal\) \. He was accused of not cooperating with the authorities\.
#### New changes to speed up asylum procedures have severely interfered with people receiving fair interviews, such as this case\.


> “ [Official figures](https://www.protothema.gr/greece/article/973425/metanasteutiko-taktiki-fast-track-gia-osous-erhodai-stin-ellada-to-2020/) released by Thema reveal that between December 16, 2019 and January 19, 2020, two of the three asylum applications were rejected\. In January this year, **the appellate committees ruling on asylum, rejected 95% of the cases examined \(a second time\) \.** These figures are the first example that new legislation to tackle migratory flows seems to be working\.”

#### A Doctors Without Borders staff member was attack Saturday night on Lesvos\.

Doctors Without Borders said in a statement:


> “On Saturday night in Lesvos one of our staff was detained by a small group of residents while driving a Doctors Without Borders car in the village of Moria\. This is the latest of the violence that has taken place in Lesvos in recent days\. Doctors Without Borders has been in Lesvos since 2008, providing health services to asylum seekers coming to Greece\. **This is the first time a member of our staff has been detained while on duty\.** Médecins Sans Frontières is constantly working to fill the huge gap that the government is unable to fill in the health care provision of the 20,000 men, women and children currently trapped in Moria\. We understand that Lesvos, like the other Greek islands, has reached a limit due to increased arrivals and huge congestion, but we are concerned about increased tensions in Lesvos and strongly condemn any acts of violence\. We call on the Greek government to act immediately and to block the island as soon as possible\.”

In another rescue: _“ [At least two dead](https://twitter.com/HelenaMaleno/status/1226570542788071429?fbclid=IwAR2n4HeV2BlPqzxUSZhZDiWZJ-wdY3psgZ3GtFDJxNfrNK2c8ftB2VvgpqU) and nineteen survivors in the patera found 800 km from the Canary Islands, in the ocean\. Family members expect to know if it is the boat of 28 people missing for two weeks\. If they were not, the tragedy could be even worse\.”_

#### EU

As of the meeting on [February 5th](https://www.hstoday.us/channels/global/frontex-to-assist-european-commission-develop-new-border-and-coast-guard-tech/) , Frontex and the European Commission’s Directorate\-General for Migration and Home Affairs will start to collaborate on new border security technology\. Apparently, Frontex’s 15 years of experience in


> “developed expertise in the area of integrated border management research and innovation…will allow the Agency to assist the Commission in evaluating research and innovation results to improve border security, including improved maritime border protection\.” 





It must be stated that this is just another deepening level of the EU trying to externalize its borders\. As [AYS featured back in December](https://medium.com/are-you-syrious/ays-daily-digest-18-12-19-whats-behind-the-flexible-operational-activities-of-frontex-e98096497daa) , Frontex is already being used by the EU to externalize deportation and other migration mechanisms in the Balkans \(countries vying for EU membership\) \. Two of the most powerful EU member\-states, France and Germany, are already sending their joint police engagement, the “ [Franco\-German Task Force](https://digit.site36.net/2020/02/10/france-and-germany-launch-new-joint-police-force/) ,” to former french colonies in Africa in an effort to externalize risk\.

**So when [Frontex](https://frontex.europa.eu/media-centre/news-release/frontex-to-provide-border-security-expertise-to-european-commission-s-research-projects-ZrCBoM) says it will** “ _identify research activities addressing capability gaps in the areas of surveillance, situational awareness, biometrics, cybersecurity and information availability and exchange_ ” **so it can** “ _translate these gaps into requirements for solutions to be researched_ ” **and then** “ _contribute to the development of solutions_ ” **so it can** “ _disseminate and exploit successful results, facilitating their market uptake and deployment_ ” **Frontex is saying that it will help the EU in its goal in externalizing its borders and the expense of protecting human rights\. More people will end up in detention in Libya, in the hands of traffickers, and die trying to escape at sea\.**
