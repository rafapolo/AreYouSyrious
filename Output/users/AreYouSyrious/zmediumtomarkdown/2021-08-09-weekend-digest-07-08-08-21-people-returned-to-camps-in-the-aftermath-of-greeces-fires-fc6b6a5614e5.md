#### FEATURE — People returned to camps in the aftermath of Greece’s fires

Over the last week, over 150 fires broke out in Greece\. The largest ones in Rhodes, in Mani and Ancient Olympia \(Peloponnese\), in northern Athens and on Evia\. It is reported that almost a third of Evia island is now burned\. At the time of writing, the fire in northern Athens has been extinguished, those in the Peloponnese seem to be under control and Evia still burns, with the fire moving towards the northernmost part of the island\. Fires are ravaging in Turkey, Southern Italy and the United States\.

[Now You See Me Moria](https://www.instagram.com/p/CSR3KUGI2Pj/) , an instagram account created by a person living in Moria 2\.0 on Lesvos and a Dutch photojournalist, commented the above video with these words:


> If you still haven’t understood what a refugee means, what it means to run away from the fire or the disaster you can ask the residents of Evia\. 




Three people died and thousands lost their houses and livelihoods\. Hectares of woodland have burned\.

Solidarity initiatives have [responded](https://twitter.com/neo__pessimist/status/1423739256523132933) quickly and strongly, supporting both humans and animals affected\. The [network of Social Kitchens and Solidarity initiatives of Athens](https://www.facebook.com/sodaattikis) sent out dry food and emergency items to those evacuated in the north of the city and in Evia\.

The government has been deflecting any responsibility, blaming climate change, the hot weather and then [mysterious arsonists](https://twitter.com/lk2015r/status/1424441815311257603) , often people on the move\. However, they forgot to mention that this year the government approved only €1\.7m for fire conservancy, while the Forestry service had asked for €17m; or that 5,000 seasonal firefighters did not have their contract renewed\. The austerity and securitisation policies of the last decade have impoverished the capability of the country to protect its own environment and to respond in a timely manner to an emergency like this\. Especially in the most remote locations, locals have been [left alone](https://twitter.com/lk2015r/status/1424445844120551429?s=20&fbclid=IwAR1CuFFzxfQ975WXhFFDFVPY_wWaAn0aXTl7uS7DY5II6LywGjvupVpNM0c) to combat the fire and protect their land\. Many local authorities have complained that the only response of the government consisted in sending police officers instead of firefighters\.

As the fires around Athens have been brought under control people have been returned to the Malakasa camps from Ritsona\. Two hundred seventeen [have also been returned](https://twitter.com/migrationgovgr/status/1424408040506281986) from the Skaramaga camp to Amygdaleza Detention Centre, which was finally evacuated only on Saturday when the fire reignited in the area for the second time\. 
Not a homecoming many would wish for\.

SYRIA
#### Four children killed by government shelling

[On Saturday](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/syria-government-shelling-kills-four-children-hama?fbclid=IwAR2HSMvNBYdmupeWQHgVGQPIcLqM2NYwO-4LBfIAMn0AXIQoCyuSUTZ05R8) , four children lost their lives in the village of Qastoun in al\-Ghab Plain, west of Hama province, northwestern Syria\. They were all from the same family and five other family members were injured\. The village is being continuously targeted, and does not have a medical centre\. The nearest medical point is 18 km away in Jisr al\-Shughour\.

KURDISTAN
#### Makhmour refugee camp attacked by ISIS\-related group

Makhmour refugee camp, in Iraqi Kurdistan, is home to more than 13,000 people, mainly Kurdish refugees who have been self\-managing their lives in the camp over the years\. Due to their close relationship with the autonomous administration of Northern Syria, over the past months, the Turkish army has repeatedly attacked the camp by air\. Since July 2019, the authorities of Iraqi Kurdistan regional government have imposed an embargo on the camp and in June 2021 they prevented a delegation of international observers to reach the camp\. It is now [reported](https://twitter.com/starrcongress/status/1423988113223847943) that on 6 August the camp was attacked by ISIS\-related groups, who injured and kidnapped an unconfirmed number of civilians\.

GERMANY
#### Demonstrations against the criminalisation of sea rescue

Seebrucke international [took to the streets](https://twitter.com/Seebruecke_intl/status/1424439122643537922) in 15 german cities to demand:

1\. the release of all civilian rescue ships & support civilian sea rescue;

2\. the immediate end of the support to the so\-called Libyan Coast Guard as well as of all push\- and pullbacks in the Mediterranean Sea\!

3\. the establishment of a European sea rescue programme;

4\. the establishment of safe and legal passage to Europe\!

UK
#### Home Office’s fake website under investigation

As we [previously reported](ays-weekend-digest-31-7-1-8-2021-a-5-year-old-child-is-the-240th-victim-of-the-balkan-route-578a0fcc9ab2) , the Home Office created a website with the purpose of deterring people from coming to the UK by providing misleading and false information\. Now, the Information Commissioner, the British Independent authority in charge of upholding information and privacy rights, is investigating a complaint about the website, as media [report](https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/uknews/fake-home-office-website-targeting-asylum-seekers-probed-by-information-commissioner/ar-AAN2MJ0) \.
