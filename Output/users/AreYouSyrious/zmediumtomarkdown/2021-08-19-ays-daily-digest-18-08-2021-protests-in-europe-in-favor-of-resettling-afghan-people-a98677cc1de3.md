#### FEATURE
#### People demonstrate in support of Afghans as governments stay silent

From Afghanistan to Europe, people are demonstrating for the rights of ordinary Afghan people to live in safety\. [In Jalalabad](https://twitter.com/f_grillmeier/status/1427957798390882304?fbclid=IwAR3kIWv7WYdkxRYTdtqOLKnWq2jD_wPPK9mXzIQGh0TGWk5rPJXXTW1N9XI) , people demonstrated and took down the Taliban flag\. The Taliban fired into the crowd, killing at least two people\.

Organizers put together protests in several major European cities urging their governments to step up and take in Afghan people seeking safety\. [People demonstrated](https://www.facebook.com/refocusmedialabs/posts/3369714956592043) in front of the Swiss parliament for safe passage\. In Scotland, people [took to the streets](https://news.stv.tv/west-central/refugees-welcome-protesters-demand-end-to-foreign-wars?fbclid=IwAR27RiUQAmryzE515YFdEuXNSet778cTP0n9UgF0zuLtapr_OWxW69krJKU&top) of Glasgow to demand an end to foreign wars and for the government to resettle more refugees\. There was also a [protest in Berlin](https://twitter.com/SeebrueckeB/status/1427651193422196750?fbclid=IwAR0eWIy6iUPqvuJ1TOzpEw5LsvlFh0eitdQKRlsrYEh66pdtWxiMKkijZMo) to evacuate people where [hundreds of people](https://twitter.com/EmmanuelleChaze/status/1427651737838575619?fbclid=IwAR2nG-4jLizDg-cV6QegO9GVUPe1w3kVeYJWmkQgDAlp-li2Fw_3rQe3z2s) reminded the German government of its obligations to solidarity\.

Others are urging the political community to act through letters and petitions\. Jan de Volder, from the Catholic lay organization Sant’Egidio, [wrote a letter](https://euobserver.com/world/152669?fbclid=IwAR10pddkExojVuI64HllPxbpCrBhxcxXsUb3lXrB_mD7oNw5ZQTcl92shmU) urging the EU to take urgent action and create a humanitarian corridor\. The organization promised its support with shelter, sponsorship, and more\. US media organizations [are lobbying](https://twitter.com/IFJGlobal/status/1427645412358373389?fbclid=IwAR1wTIkiTSrq007T0U1iIRvGTsluByn15WIo3bBWGOeJoPZT0iA4ReXqlfQ) the government to evacuate local media workers who are often the first targeted for reprisals\.

This is in contrast to the cowardly actions of European governments\. In Kabul, Dutch diplomats [fled the embassy](https://gazettengr.com/dutch-diplomats-flee-kabul-abandon-afghan-staff-with-taliban/?fbclid=IwAR1OOUVjlk2ensHRLwgL0ouZ4rlAaIczevgZp_vUk0seVdpAss7DU1Dt51U) without saying anything to local Afghan staff, whose lives are now in danger because of the assistance that they gave to the Dutch government that cruelly abandoned them\. Swedish staff [abandoned their embassy](https://twitter.com/ChrChristensen/status/1427400455576080388?fbclid=IwAR3XPpgqgT9ZxORY87L-nM07vj_4eFcck9CPUA3Pvh_17ubgf-WrYGPgd_g) in the middle of the work day, while local staff were working beside them, then refused to respond to any contact from the people whom they left behind\.

The German government has left behind t [housands of local staff](https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/local-hires-stranded-in-afghanistan-they-don-t-care-about-my-life-a-7f755418-7fde-4c86-a6e8-0d8bb86bb7e5?fbclid=IwAR2oXOKEZfbN1xRpywzFpFqtEi6k98C9m0QlnPGj1HZk8PwRgYbSvZSFdwY#ref=rss) whose lives are in danger after the government’s evacuation plan that was supposed to get people to safety before US withdrawal was blocked by the arduous bureaucracy it implemented\. The obsession with paperwork will cost people their lives\. While the government subsequently said that it [will negotiate with the Taliban](https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/afghanistan-bundesregierung-will-mit-taliban-direkt-verhandeln-a-c6ec3216-c5d2-42c5-a3aa-fc895b945fec?sara_ecid=soci_upd_KsBF0AFjflf0DZCxpPYDCQgO1dEMph&fbclid=IwAR0OnfRGOwl-VaUC8pastlAacayLG7wSBybUXIecLmjV1EpeHrwR1s_EmJE) to rescue people they left behind, those evacuations will likely be limited in scope and still leave behind many workers and their families\.

The UK Home Office boasts about its resettlement scheme, but the government only agreed to take in [20,000 people](https://twitter.com/connellyandrew/status/1427976420798697473?fbclid=IwAR1OOUVjlk2ensHRLwgL0ouZ4rlAaIczevgZp_vUk0seVdpAss7DU1Dt51U) over the course of several years\. The details of the scheme are also unclear and it is possible that people may be forced to stay under Taliban rule for years while their applications are processed\. The response was criticized by organizations including JCWI, who [put out a briefing](https://www.jcwi.org.uk/briefing-the-afghanistan-crisis-and-refugee-rights?fbclid=IwAR11jhklKR0vccECMy80koryapZJTXRcejBp0T0yE8wX1f2IanJe5gSjV24) saying that it is irresponsible to expect people to “form an orderly queue and wait for the possibility of resettlement\.”

Before governments even pressed send on the initial statements of solidarity, they are already working on ways to shut out Afghan people\. Frontex has already said that they are “observing” the situation, which in practice will mean more pushbacks of people fleeing a violent situation that Europe and NATO contributed to\. [This article](https://jacobinmag.com/2021/08/afghanistan-refugees-war-terror-frontex-macron/?fbclid=IwAR2hPja34nVQELdYBh-sOQAzjLXdNspAXOWcDZpEtaUJ7DdBAkTj2sFZupY) offers an overview of the ways different European states have already started to dodge their responsibility towards their fellow humans\.

European officials have already said that they are open to negotiations with the Taliban\. Josep Borrell, the High Representative for Foreign Affairs, said that the EU [needs to talk](https://twitter.com/mariatad/status/1427674486510346240?fbclid=IwAR0OnfRGOwl-VaUC8pastlAacayLG7wSBybUXIecLmjV1EpeHrwR1s_EmJE) with the Taliban to “ [prevent a humanitarian](https://www.politico.eu/article/borrell-calls-for-dialogue-with-talibans-they-have-won/?fbclid=IwAR3AINqJ1sYbBqfc0pdAMWn7TNfKdaYCCOGdFpF_HFHM0q1wMq3oOx1c_bk) and potential migratory disaster\.” Many observers [are worried](https://twitter.com/lk2015r/status/1427943984987574279) that this means that the EU is open to creating deals on deportations and refusing asylum with the Taliban\. Given the intense xenophobic statements made by top\-ranking European officials recently, this possibility is not out of the question\.

Other Afghans are concerned that the EU will get taken in by the Taliban’s press conferences, where they promise a new form of rule, while the reality on the ground is that the Taliban are [reinstating repression](https://twitter.com/FrudBezhan/status/1427660945808035841?fbclid=IwAR1z5-HRFaJtlRaJqikLozO-M2ka4FrPSdi33NmP9XgpC_rCyuDo5JkAiyo) , particularly [outside of Kabul](https://twitter.com/BegumBasdas/status/1427675892873039876) where there is less attention\. Taliban forces already [blew up a statue](https://twitter.com/EzzatMehrdad/status/1427874795719434240?fbclid=IwAR0eWIy6iUPqvuJ1TOzpEw5LsvlFh0eitdQKRlsrYEh66pdtWxiMKkijZMo) of Abdul Ali Mazari, a Hazara leader, undermining their claims that they will be more tolerant of Hazaras this time\. [This interview](https://www.freitag.de/autoren/elsa-koester/es-ging-nie-um-frieden-in-afghanistan?fbclid=IwAR2hPja34nVQELdYBh-sOQAzjLXdNspAXOWcDZpEtaUJ7DdBAkTj2sFZupY) in German goes beyond press conference platitudes and gets at the real situation in Afghanistan\.

What these stories together show us is that Western governments cannot be counted on to do the right thing on their own\. It is up to us ordinary citizens to protest and pressure our governments to resettle people in need and to provide for people already in our countries who have been failed by the state\. It is the least we owe to Afghans\.

#### SEA
#### Recent rescues

[This post](https://sosmediterranee.com/eyes-on-the-central-med-25/?fbclid=IwAR3NXsWCLLgX1SCFujFDWKo0bGw9ORBP0DURAj2uBFnRFHLfyG8xqMJAfYg) from SOS Mediterranee summarizes recent events at sea\. Hundreds of people are aboard the NGO ship, the Geo Barents\. Another group was on the ResQ People ship but are now on their way to Augusta, Sicily\.

Our friends at AlarmPhone won the [human rights award](https://twitter.com/ProAsyl/status/1427989990647255045?fbclid=IwAR11jhklKR0vccECMy80koryapZJTXRcejBp0T0yE8wX1f2IanJe5gSjV24) from ProAsyl\! It is a well deserved award for their vital work\.
#### GREECE
#### New arrivals in Chios

A [group of 25 peopl](https://astraparis.gr/afixi-25-prosfygon-stin-notia-chio-vrike-tin-varka-to-limenarcheio/?fbclid=IwAR1fdzyWW-o0cqU-OYqZ6gspPPsolzFOqi-bPvKPNFUrVkCzBzgoPZAb4sg) e landed on Chios\. The people moved away from the beach and started moving towards the interior of the island, probably afraid of pushbacks if they ran into authorities\. We hope they will be able to find safety and that the authorities will not push them back\.
#### CROATIA
#### Desperate people turn to overdoses to seek safety

Many people playing the “Game,” trying to cross into Europe via the Balkan route, are turning to increasingly desperate methods to secure safety for themselves and their families\. People are ingesting dangerous substances and [deliberately overdosing](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2021/8/17/we-eat-tobacco-drink-shampoo-overdosing-for-asylum-in-europe?fbclid=IwAR2s5dtYZNxOMUrL1WiJWLyVBYWhglbIWayDLhFhRyBEto4czjj3ELv9cEU) in the hopes that Croatian police will take them to the hospital instead of pushing them back to Bosnia & Herzegovina\. Unfortunately, the police often push back people in severe medical distress anyway\.
#### SPAIN
#### Temporary end to deportation of minors

A Spanish court [temporarily halted](https://www.facebook.com/cestacestero/posts/10225554861234613) the deportations of minors from Ceuta to Morocco after lawyers from Coordinadora de Barrios filed a lawsuit\. While such cruel treatment of children should never have occurred in the first place, hopefully this will lead to a permanent end of this inhumane practice\.
#### FRANCE
#### Attacks on Afghan people without shelter

The latest in a series of governmental attacks on people on the move living in the streets took place on Tuesday night\. French security forces pushed a group of [about 60 Afghan asylum seekers](https://twitter.com/Utopia_56/status/1427887372432257027?s=19&fbclid=IwAR26EnYZ4GN1lGyFKKSWoGlYo_h1-sjgo6T8ZLUsdkxVfC5rnAMpDO91Sqo) out of Paris\. The police used tear gas and violence to expel the people\.

This is part of a larger pattern where the French government uses violent methods to evict people from the street\. However, they are only sleeping rough because the government is not fulfilling its legal obligation to house people while they wait for their asylum applications\.
#### GERMANY
#### More surveillance in Bavaria

The German border state of Bavaria announced that it is increasing its [surveillance capacities](https://twitter.com/matthimon/status/1428030667028369409?fbclid=IwAR1fdzyWW-o0cqU-OYqZ6gspPPsolzFOqi-bPvKPNFUrVkCzBzgoPZAb4sg) with a helium balloon and mobile camera vans\. These will probably be used against people on the move crossing the southern border\.
#### BELARUS BORDER
#### More repression at the border as EU turns to militarization

The Belarusian government continues to use people on the move as pawns in its conflict with the EU\. True to form, the European Union has responded with illegal pushbacks and increased militarization in the Belarus/Lithuania/Latvia/Poland border zone\.

After an [extraordinary meeting](https://slovenian-presidency.consilium.europa.eu/en/news/extraordinary-meeting-of-interior-ministers-to-take-place-under-crisis-response-mechanism-in-face-of-migration-situation-in-lithuania/?fbclid=IwAR0eWIy6iUPqvuJ1TOzpEw5LsvlFh0eitdQKRlsrYEh66pdtWxiMKkijZMo) of interior ministers, the EU Presidency [put out a statement](https://twitter.com/EU2021SI/status/1427988795237052431?fbclid=IwAR1u6wOBy5rDuK9wJH1H7n5MpD0mteac8czswsVP2Ze6hcnA-VXXACmuLAw) saying that it “expresses its solidarity with the countries affected by the migratory pressure on the EU’s external border with Belarus\.” However, it did not bother to express solidarity with the poor people caught in the middle of two heavily armed forces\. The presidency also agreed to [deploy more forces](https://slovenian-presidency.consilium.europa.eu/en/news/home-affairs-ministers-express-solidarity-with-the-eu-member-states-at-the-border-with-belarus/?fbclid=IwAR1OOUVjlk2ensHRLwgL0ouZ4rlAaIczevgZp_vUk0seVdpAss7DU1Dt51U) at the border and to increase deportations to countries of origin\.

Meanwhile, the situation on the ground for people on the move, caught between more and more hostile armed forces, is getting dire\. A group of people reported violent pushbacks [by the Belarusian police](https://twitter.com/InfoMigrants/status/1427656715634360327?fbclid=IwAR0C0hqXnGUFKZGlwlgYRqBaAxK6_rEm08f8aj-DfrPtZlGL-HGlqGQsuUs) , which beat them and broke their phones\. There is also video evidence of the police in riot gear [pushing people](https://twitter.com/TadeuszGiczan/status/1427689700425404423?fbclid=IwAR2lzHuyePObI6GdN2UYuGNL6l1SUkVL4_2AZT2F4pIaVrWXgjkO9stcQ4s) across the Lithuanian border\.

A group of people have been [stuck in no man’s land](https://twitter.com/dwnews/status/1427884214687391744?fbclid=IwAR11jhklKR0vccECMy80koryapZJTXRcejBp0T0yE8wX1f2IanJe5gSjV24) for a week between the Belarusian and Latvian border\. They have no shelter or food, but cannot go anywhere because neither side will let them pass\.

The situation will only get worse as Poland is looking into legislation to formally legalize pushbacks\. The government has already [put up barbed wire](https://twitter.com/DunyaCollective/status/1427996598437650439?fbclid=IwAR0CXdUInCTe8d03HMwPDz7MTmrUXeKoaAs8-_5g5036YS5G7HVXkklyVP4) at the border\.
#### UK
#### Investigation into false Home Office website

The UK Information Commissioner’s Office is [investigating the Home Office](https://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/digital-deception-disinformation-used-to-deter-migrants/?fbclid=IwAR1PFmv4u97WKXjXnkS31z2YhCaQWRJMUWGNDbgPNvKEHnjFTSz7_K_WMd8) for creating “On the Move,” a website that spread false information about asylum and collected people’s personal data without disclosing that it was connected to the Home Office\. The site featured false claims that the UK is carrying out ongoing returns to the EU, even though it has not been able to do so since Brexit, and directed people to information on seeking asylum in Europe\. The site raises thorny questions about governmental misuse of anonymity as well as the prevalence of data collection sites and misuse\.
