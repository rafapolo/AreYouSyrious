#### FEATURED: WHERE HAS ALL THE MONEY GONE?

[Stonisi has raised questions](https://stonisi.gr/post/16315/paidia-mas-vlepoyn-pente-eyrw-th-mera-gia-na-menoyn-nhstikoi-pics?fbclid=IwAR0UDoCc2x4ArpvAAJ_UV0vaq_AqQyJBJXcSbntQR96sCICzPq5JHTjWZ48) as to the budget used to feed approximately 7,500 people on Lesvos\.


■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 
> **[Franziska Grillmeier](https://twitter.com/f_grillmeier) @ Twitter Says:** 

> > “This was breakfast today,” writes camp resident from Syria in temporary camp #Mavrovouni on #Lesvos. 
“If a family has children, milk is added. For elderlies, this is all they get.” 
- “What can you put on the bread?”
- “Nothing. I rely on people f. outside the camp to help.” /1 https://t.co/kTvCSaTSNr

■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 


A new company is charging 4\.99 euros a day for poor quality and inadequate food\.


> This is because the rumors about the close family relationship of executives of this company with a top executive of the second degree of self\-government from another part of the country and a leading party player of the governing party, give or take\. — [_Stonisi_](https://stonisi.gr/post/16315/paidia-mas-vlepoyn-pente-eyrw-th-mera-gia-na-menoyn-nhstikoi-pics?fbclid=IwAR0UDoCc2x4ArpvAAJ_UV0vaq_AqQyJBJXcSbntQR96sCICzPq5JHTjWZ48) 





It is housed in a building which belongs to a local company liquidated in 2001\. Previously rented to other companies for 2500 to 3500 euros per month it has now dropped to just 200 euros per month\!

This combined with the [recent expose of Hopeland](https://wearesolomon.com/mag/community/millions-in-funding-at-stake-for-refugee-housing/) — a government\-tasked and previously unknown NGO with no history of working with refugees which will receive over 5 million euros to house 1002 people for a year, raises serious questions about the use of EU funds destined for the care of people on the move\.

The only thing that seems definite? That some already well off people will make a lot of money from the enforced misery of others\. And that the EU will allow this to happen\.

SEA
#### Malta, Do Your Job\!

Just before Easter, Malta refused to rescue a boat in distress in their naval area\. Now, the country’s Armed Forces put out a press statement full of lies, claiming that the people were not actually in distress despite the severe overcrowding on the boat and that they had never been in the Maltese SAR zone\!

[Sea\-Watch’s response](https://www.facebook.com/seawatchprojekt/posts/2803744736510256) :


> The denial of all facts and responsibility by Maltese authorities seems like a perpetrator\-victim reversal\. An ill\-navigated, overcrowded wooden boat with 80 people on board, at sea for many hours, struggling with dehydration, and asking for help is by all definitions a distress case\. 





> A maritime emergency line that cannot be reached and refuses to do its job is dangerous\. A rescue coordination center that does everything to prevent rescues and openly admits to send boats on the long way to Italy is cynical and plays with people’s lives\. 





GREECE
#### 1,100 People transferred but to what?

The number of people in Moria 2\.0 is now [under 6000](https://greekreporter.com/2021/04/15/number-of-refugees-at-lesvos-camp-declines-significantly/?fbclid=IwAR0IVEPyXsNeZi1kxipvf1oe7VwLdhW8j1m0IMcB5XV-3q6Vm2m2mzRbew0) but many of the people transferred face difficult situations when the arrive on the mainland:

> > 1,100 people left Lesvos in the past month, good news? It’s a good headline for authorities yes but when ppl arrive mainland conditions aren’t always better. I met an Afghan family sitting outside their new apartment building yesterday with their baby, they arrived 2 days ago...

Many face homelessness like this family evicted from Rhodes, now living on a street in Athens:


■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 
> **[RSA](https://twitter.com/rspaegean) @ Twitter Says:** 

> > According to media reports approx. 40-50 #refugeesgr including families with small children, who were evicted by police from the informal camp in the former slaughterhouses  on #Rhodes on Tuesday ended up homeless in #Athens.

And all have only the slimmest chance at accessing “ [employment or social welfare schemes, while stranded in e\.g\. Athens or Thessaloniki for the first time, many don’t even have access \(& don’t get enough assistance\) to create a bank account, get a tax number etc](https://twitter.com/f_grillmeier/status/1382599923372285952) \.”

Meanwhile the ministry has announced that [cash assistance will be cut](https://migration.gov.gr/katarghsh-oikonomikou-voithimatos-se-aitoyntes-poy-de-stegazontai-se-domes-toy-ypoyrgeioy/?fbclid=IwAR1dc-8WGBpL-jkTATIOB_zcVH4VHFz6tUHJMJGMRDj1YQkfVR25oGPpFtY) to all people seeking international protection who not residing in state run structures from the first of July\.
#### New Corona cases on Samos

[11 positive case of COVID 19](https://twitter.com/AVeizis/status/1382770370994917377) have been recorded in the Samos camp\. 2896 humans are currently ‘hosted’ in a place with capacity 648\. As we have stated many times before, this is not acceptable even when we are not in the middle of a pandemic\.
#### Two new patrol boats for HCG

[A ceremony has been held](https://twitter.com/PrimeministerGR/status/1382723320890679301) for two new vessels which we can only assume are being brought in to help with pushbacks\. Mitsotakis used the occasion to experiment with language again:

Translation: the experience of #pushbacks, violence, deaths. https://t.co/7GYEubtBrH

BOSNIA & HERZEGOVINA
#### Updates from Bihać

Unseasonably cold weather, including snowfall in early spring, is affecting the people sleeping rough along the Balkan route\. Many people need warm footwear, sleeping bags, and blankets\. No Name Kitchen is doing their best to help the people, but they don’t have enough supplies\. More information in [their update](https://www.facebook.com/NoNameKitchenBelgrade/posts/1218874575177491) \.

CROATIA
#### No Justice for Madina

The Croatian Constitutional Court [rejected a lawsuit](https://www.jutarnji.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/ustavni-sud-odbacio-tuzbu-obitelji-nesretno-poginule-madine-nisu-povrijedena-vasa-prava-15065468?fbclid=IwAR2i5GJoR5vQBEgv8wOauspQFFlxU8MLLHtv5IY-kwDGk78N8Pj_sPvZ9xU) brought by the family of Madina Hosseini, a six\-year\-old Afghan girl who was killed when Croatian police illegally pushed her family back into Serbia\. The family said that the Croatian justice system violated their rights by refusing to conduct a thorough investigation into the little girl’s death, especially since a crucial piece of evidence went missing, and that the logic of the police investigating itself does not lend itself to justice\. The Court ruled that there were no issues in the investigation\.

Sometimes, it is difficult to live with the understanding that we live in a system where a child can die as the result of police violence and nobody blinks an eye\. It is difficult to live with the understanding that a grieving family can be met with years of judicial mistreatment instead of compassion\. Rest in peace, Madina\. Our world should have treated you better\.

FRANCE
#### Report on 2020 Violence in Calais and Grand\-Synthe

Human Rights Observers published their annual report on the violence on the French\-British border, which can be accessed [here](http://www.laubergedesmigrants.fr/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Rapport-annuel-2020-Human-Rights-Observers.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2_8kxs6qIFnPmA4JavRRg3_WFg90SSoCDIqv3PPe4HPNmbpnBWQE2Wr5w) \. They [denounced](https://www.facebook.com/utopia56grandesynthe/posts/295775862135633) the near\-constant violent evictions as well as other violations of human rights\.

The situation in northern France has been bad for years, but Brexit has only increased the repression that people on the move face\. In addition to routine evictions, the government uses tactics such as clearing out forests, limiting access to food and water, and the weaponization of judicial procedures to intimidate the people\.
#### 300 people to be resettled from Lebanon

The French government renewed the agreement forming a “ [humanitarian corridor](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/31535/france-inks-humanitarian-corridor-agreement-to-bring-in-300-refugees?fbclid=IwAR3F-pK7M2UGlXSHI9Grvdkwwa2lT90QawtA_qE3xiDRnwIjjuY1x0VVxaM) ,” which would resettle 300 vulnerable people currently displaced in Lebanon\.
#### Food and NFI items needed in Paris

Solidaritè migrants Wilson needs your help\! If you’re based in Paris, donate food and hygienic products so they can help feed the people\. For a list of accepted items and collection points, go [here](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1703135413220557&id=598228360377940) \.

EU/FRONTEX
#### More Externalization of Borders

The EU is extending its border mechanisms further into Senegal\. The bloc facilitated the completion of an extensive biometric database in the country that would make it easier for Europe to deport Senegalese citizens\. More on the situation in this report from [Statewatch](https://www.statewatch.org/news/2021/april/senegal-biometric-population-database-will-facilitate-deportations-restricted-eu-document-confirms/?fbclid=IwAR3tAK6b8qLTgkxHF3bUXf1s8_NaA1I9EPaPA7Tqhn3WSr7asTu5VhESukA) \.

UK
#### More damning reports on the Home Office mistreatment of people on the move

An unpublished Prison Inspectorate report into the accommodation of people on the move in the Napier barracks in Kent, “warns of major weaknesses in the way residents with serious mental health and welfare needs are cared for at the camp,” media report\.

According to the parts of the reports seen cited in court and released to journalists, there have been seven incidents of self\-harm at the barracks and seven residents have threatened suicide\. Despite the Home Office had stated that no vulnerable people would be sent to Napier barracks, “safeguarding failings meant suicidal individuals and potential trafficking victims had remained there for weeks\.” One man was kept in the camp for several weeks after attempting to take his own life\.
