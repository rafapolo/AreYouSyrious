### Syria — Feature

Although a UN cease\-fire treaty was announced this week, attacks on civilians have not stopped in Eastern Ghouta and Damascus\. Almost immediately after the cease\-fire was declared Eastern Ghouta was hit by missiles believed to be fired by Assad’s forces\.

For its part, Russia has rejected the UN cease\-fire, instead offering to stop shelling in the region for five hours a day\. The fact that five hours a day free of shelling could even be considered a “cease\-fire” speaks to the dire situation there\.

Today the [Syrian\-American Medical Society](https://www.facebook.com/SyrianAmericanMedicalSociety/?hc_ref=ARQDLaR6ZCRZDGW_390lO9stMsg20yxHtm9o16pNYsVhsRRPRbvERsrfmBFkOd7aq08&fref=nf) NGO released a statement and figures on the number of civilians killed this weekend\. They reported that the cease\-fire has had no effect on the ground, and has become a “dead letter”\. From their statment:


> On Saturday, 58 people were killed, and 136 injured\. On Sunday, 29 people were killed and 206, almost half of whom were women and children\. On this day, a SAMS\-supported hospital received 16 patients suffering from symptoms consistent with the use of a chemical weapon, chlorine\. One of these patients, a child, died due to exposure to the chlorine\. 





> We have also received reports from the United Relief Office that this morning, at 1 am local time, 11 people from one family were killed in airstrikes\. 





> From February 19 to 25, we have recorded 540 deaths in East Ghouta due to the horrific escalation\. Over half of whom are women and children\. Over 3,000 have been injured\. 




### Libya

The Italian government delivered [three additional patrol ships](https://betweenlibyaanditaly.wordpress.com/2018/02/25/italy-has-reportedly-delivered-further-vessels-to-tripolis-coast-guard-in-libya/) to the Libyan Coast Guard \(LCG\) this week\. Italy continues to cooperate with the Libyan regime and the LCG despite many documented instances of the LCG attacking refugees and forcibly returning them from international waters where they have no authority\) \.
### Turkey

This weekend the Turkish government [announced](https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/turkey-says-un-syria-ceasefire-wont-affect-kurdish-offensive/?utm_term=Autofeed&utm_campaign=Echobox&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Facebook#link_time=1519668986) that the UN security council’s demands for a 30 day cease fire in Syria will not stop their offensive against Kurdish troops in the Afrin region\. The Turkish offensive has already resulted in civilian casualties on both sides of the Turkish\-Syrian border\.

The Erdogan regime has harshly cracked down on any criticism of the Afrin offensive\. Over 700 social media users have been arrested for questioning the assault, and approximately 100 journalists and politicians have also been detained for speaking out\.
### Sea

A boat carrying five people was rescued off the coast of Spain and taken to the town of Tarifa this morning\. At mid\-day the Spanish medical group [Emergencias 112 reported](https://twitter.com/E112Andalucia/status/968176153222631428) that one of the five people died due to heart complications\. Accoriding to the [EuropaPress](http://www.europapress.es/andalucia/cadiz-00351/noticia-fallece-cinco-migrantes-patera-trasladada-tarifa-cadiz-20180226184515.html) outlet, all five people were taken to medical services, but doctors were unable to revive the man\. It is currently unclear how this death is related to the sea crossing, but it seems likely that this attack was caused or made worse by the extreme stress and physical exposure of the crossing\.

The Emergencias 112 team is reporting strong winds off the coast of Andalusia tomorrow, making crossing especially hazardous\.
### Greece
#### Islands

_Arrivals_

Today one boat was picked up off Samos by a German Frontex vessel\.
There were 33 people on board, 11 children, 9 women, and 13 men\.

> Winter is not over in Greece\! Amber Vandam, our coordinator in Nea Kavala refugee camp reports today: 





> “With temperatures reaching to \-12 degrees, Winter has arrived in Nea Kavala\. Our volunteers battled the snow and ice to ensure we were still able to distribute clothes & food, and provide our services to the residents of the camp\. 





> We had to cancel the bike rentals due to the poor conditions, which meant no class or supermarket for many\. Whilst the snow seemed beautiful for a short while, realities soon hit when we discovered the water pipes had frozen — no water to the showers or toilets, and only two working for drinking water\. The camp was quiet today, as everyone huddled around their heating — my only hope is that the electricity generator does not freeze over…” 




### AMKA

### Serbia

Forwarding a report on a new trend of Iranian refugees and asylum seekers entering Serbia under tourist visas, written by the Serbian [Info Park](https://www.facebook.com/infoparkserbia/?hc_ref=ARRj2XeYT2AnXnuqryFozjp_ZvkFiknnENlo4MT_8MdScYLGB_jQyP3L9lZ-28HVQ6A&fref=nf&hc_location=group) team:


> Since the visa liberalization of Iranian citizens, over 6,000 “Iranian tourists” entered the country in the past five months, according to official Ministry of Interior data\. It is interesting that a large number of them decided not to return from Serbia to their country of origin, but to continue the illegal pathway towards Western Europe, which is presenting a new test to the migration management systems\. 





> According to the results of structured interviews of Iranian citizens, conducted by Info Park since the autumn of 2017, Serbia is used as a transit zone\- felt to be the safest and cheapest bypass to their final destination in Western Europe\. This situation accords with the bilateral agreement between Iran and Serbia on 22 August 2017; which introduced a visa liberalization allowing citizens of Iran to enter Serbia as tourists, with the right to stay up to 30 days\. 





> Although they entered Serbia as tourists, interviews have revealed that many Iranians use their stay in Belgrade to establish connections with smugglers, who will transfer them to their desired destination, across the borders of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Hungary or Romania\. Interviewed respondents cite their reasons for fleeing Iran as the following: the sense of endangered human rights and freedoms, primarily in the domain of political, religious and sexual orientation\. Many Iranians want to go to a country where there is a greater chance of economic prosperity, and see in the West the prospects of a better life\. Among the interviewed population there are predominantly young couples or single men, who identify as Christians, LGBTQ population or as opposition voters\. They feel unsafe and that they have been subjected to persecutions in their country of origin\.

#### Ventimiglia

The [SolidariTea](https://www.facebook.com/refugeesolidaritea/) volunteer team is reporting freezing conditions in Ventimiglia, making life unbearable for refugees sleeping on the streets\. The group reports that there are approximately 250 people sleeping under a bridge in the area\. Today volunteer Kesha Niya commented on the situation in Ventimiglia:


> The weather has seriously turned and the whole of Ventimiglia is under snow\. We are preparing as best we can but it could continue for days\. The weather conditions are so harsh that we can no longer travel in to distribute food and so a few of our group have moved down to Ventimiglia over the next days \(thanks to Solidaritea for hosting us\) and will provide emergency food and other services as necessary to the many people, including children and pregnant women, who will sleep in snow covered tents under a highway bridge tonight\. We need support right now more than ever\.

Independent volunteers and NGO’s are still reporting a dangerous situation on the streets of Paris\. Although the large piles of snow are gone, the capital is heading into another week of sub\-zero temperatures\. As one volunteer bluntly put it,


> “People are going to die if they are forced to live outside in these conditions\. It’s that simple\.” 




The [RefuComm](https://www.facebook.com/refucomm/?hc_ref=ARSPGGvbNYItHLJO4I1kVLOc-3iCuddDAU7nsBHvFWDIf64cnWO2XGMGS1cPd2m7CdE) information team has spent the last week in Paris, working with grassroots organizations and speaking with refugees living on the streets\. They reported a brief summary of their findings today:


> Information is not easily accessible in formats and languages people understand or prefer\. This has a really negative affect on their asylum applications\. 





> 50% of the respondents in the sample could not read and therefore need information in film format\. 





> Conditions for refugees in Paris are abominable\. The procedures are complicated and drawn out\.
