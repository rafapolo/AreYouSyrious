### FEATURE: The transfers that didn’t happen

According to [data published by Greek authorities](https://www.aplotaria.gr/refugees-as-numbers/?fbclid=IwAR2uExDFy22N66eRn2vXguGUfQVpmVn4OoXbm0esZi3YAym5MtW7FExNjVc) , from the 19th to the 20th of November, 2,656 disappeared from the island detention camps on Chios, Samos, and Lesvos\. Such a massive decongestion of the islands would certainly be welcome news, and help ease the awful conditions in the Aegean detention camps\. However, there is a problem with these figures showing an exodus of people from the islands — they appear to be made up\. The official figures only show 5 people being transferred off the Aegean islands on the 19th, the remaining 2,651 seem to have simply dissaperaed\.

Why are the Greek authorities publishing this massive reduction in numbers? Are they attempting to falsely show themselves as working to improve conditions on the islands? Or is this an attempt to correct their inflated estimate of people on the island? As the AYS and other groups have pointed out, the number of people on the islands is often inflated by the Greek interior ministry\. However, the Greek ministry’s estimate is now lower than that of Aegean Boat Report \( [17,877 people on 18/11](https://www.facebook.com/AegeanBoatReport/photos/a.285312485325196/477613589428417/?type=3&theater) \), which is compiled from both UNHCR figures and those provided by independent groups and volunteers\.

Regardless of the story behind the ‘deleted’ people, it is representive of a sinister approach endorsed by both the Greek authorities and the UNHCR and IOM: the attempt to deal with humanitarian crises through data and statistics\. Rather than working towards with the basic human needs of refugees, the UNHCR and Greek authorities have chosen to focus on their self\-serving data collection and reports\. It is telling that the Greek interior ministy would simply remove over 2,500 people from their estimates without comment\. The lack of clarity or accuracy in reports by the Greek authorities are representative of their disregard for refugees’ lives\. As the [NoBorders network wrote](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1652972374920129/permalink/2121391194744909/) in regards to this story, “\[these organizations\] deal with refugees and immigrants as lifeless numbers, who can be ‘disappeared’ through a report on a simple piece of paper\.”

### MOROCCO
#### Human rights group targets illegal push\-backs to Morocco

In order to fight illegal push\-backs, the Moroccan Association for Human Rights \(AMDH\) is calling for refugees who were pushed back from Spain to share their stories\. According to the group, dozens of people have been turned back from Spain in recent weeks without having the opportunity to apply for asylum\. If you would like to speak with the group you can contact them on [their page](https://www.facebook.com/AmdhNador/?__tn__=%2CdkCH-R-R&eid=ARAyu0VYIlUUuHh73Rtu9v39N3jk7UDWzQafqnxzamlj2mtf-FE052E55MBOhQmYKerrQRMEs5BjcNiB&hc_ref=ARQ9nqQWr1Kt8fs6ywHmnywgKIGCkEqQ6FM7zWlhwA0bxce56PMSGkLUxwwFi46N5QI&fref=nf&hc_location=group) \.

AMDH also made accusations against the Moroccan authorities in Nador this week, claiming that the police are deliberately arresting migrants and charging them as traffickers when they know the charges are false\. The group claims police bribery is widespread, and that the bigger people smugglers walk free, while ordinary people trying to flee to safety are arrested\. “Meanwhile, the true smugglers are spared and stay protected, continuing to lead the beautiful life in Casablanca, Rabat, Tangier and other cities,” writes the group\.

> Many people are forced to sleep on the muddy ground, in the park\. Only few have tents\. Families are in the middle of the park, around them are groups of single men, refugees who don’t have a family but they stick together in packs\. Some of them are very violent and their behavior, especially when people are using drugs or alcohol, intimidate all of the children on the camp\. 





> A few nights ago, I found a girl on the camp, she must be 7 or younger, with the most horrific cough I have ever heard\. She was coughing her lungs out, she is really sick\. This morning , almost a week later, she has finally seen a doctor\. She came with a large family, all of her 3 siblings are younger than she is\. Her parents didn’t want to leave the grandmother, so they are now family of 7, sleeping on the street, waiting for the housing and asylum\. They are almost impossible to house overnight in Parisians solidarity network, since no one has a place for 7 people\. 





Volunteers in the capital need help\. If you can help lodge people for a night, please contact [Utopia 56](https://www.facebook.com/asso.utopia56/) \. As the temperature drops, safe spaces for people to sleep are needed more than ever\. If you have wooden pallets to donate, or tents or warm winter clothing contact [Danika](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100009499466124&__tn__=%2CdCH-R-R&eid=ARBzDOmtFOTKEywdhYkG4uuRzucLr-pXDQmp7CuyvTlQhaNOARxVaGNj6S9VWjaNKXb4iMxJKa3RzEe4&hc_ref=ARRWefxc-kQZH5xFpFTv2aO8CCbMptMUoUxJnBFL3G5WkeaNyX4j9svMXv3092OHebo&fref=nf&hc_location=group) \.

Independent volunteer Lola Siran shared a similar story about vulnerable people being left on the streets today:


> Yesterday night temperatures were below 0 degrees — like they have been for most of the week\. I couldn’t help but think of the people sleeping rough outside when I received a call from R\., 19\. 





> “I need your help\. Can a woman sleep in your home? Just for tonight\.” 





> The cold is deadly and there’s no way her — or anyone else — should be left sleeping outside\. With these temperatures, another night spent outside can mean life or death\. 





> I guess they don’t see it this way there\. Or that they don’t care enough to see it because it’s dramatically obvious\. People will die this winter if the government doesn’t take its responsibilities\. 





There will be a demonstration in Paris on November 23rd to protest the abandonment of minors\. Find the details below\.

#### Authorities deny minors protection in Paris

Not only are many minors and children living on the streets, but these young people are frequently deprived of their rights when they are evaluated by social assistance workers\. Minors are frequently being categorized as adults by simply because of a lack of avaialble accommodation, according to the volunteer group [Solidarity Migrants Wilson](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1026910847509687&id=598228360377940) \. For example, if there are ten beds available in a shelter, and a long line of minors waiting to be seen, only ten people will be recognized as minors, and the others arbitrarily sent away\.

### ITALY
#### More cruel evictions

36 people in Trento were kicked out of an emergency shelter on Saturday this past week\. The shelter had been provided by the town administration, to accommodate people who were waiting for a space in the reception center\. Local organizations are demanding that shelter is provided for the people who were kicked out, and that the authorities in the county stop telling people that they need to have their own accommodation before applying for asylum \(which is a lie\) \. You can read the full story in Italian [here](https://www.facebook.com/notes/assemblea-antirazzista-trento/laccoglienza-è-un-diritto-fondamentale/204922623640158/) \.
#### Upcoming demonstration in Rome

There will be a national demonstration in Rome on December 15th for the rights of refugees\. Find the details below\.
