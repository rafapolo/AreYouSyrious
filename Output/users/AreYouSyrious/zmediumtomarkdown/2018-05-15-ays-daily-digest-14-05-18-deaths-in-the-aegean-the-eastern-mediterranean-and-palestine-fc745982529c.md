People fleeing from war, people fighting for their freedom, people desperate to live, do not deserve to die at the hands of Western ‘Democracies’ or due to EU’s willed blindness of their plight\.

Today 7 people have been [confirmed dead](http://m.ensonhaber.com/canakkalede-kacaklari-tasiyan-tekne-batti-7-olu.html) after a fibre boat, allegedly carrying 20 people sank on the coast of Babakale, Ayvacik county, Turkey at 23\.00\. 13 people where rescued, and 7 dead bodies, including two children,were picked up from the sea after a fisherman spotted the boat and alerted the Turkish Coast guard\.

The boat was heading towards the North of Lesvos\. Search and rescue operations continue as more people could still be in the area\. Vessels and a helicopter from TCG are involved in the search\.

In Northern Cyprus [Local media](https://cyprus-mail.com/2018/05/14/dead-bodies-washed-up-on-north-beach-believed-to-be-drowned-syrian-migrants/) and the [Missing Migrants Project report](https://twitter.com/MissingMigrants/status/996083968326950913) that the bodies of 9 people washed up on the shore on Sunday and Monday\. The death toll is expected to rise further\. This is the second shipwreck recorded this year in the Eastern Mediterranean\. The people who lost their lives are believed to be Syrian, the youngest, only 24 years old\.

And in Palestine during protests again the new US Embassy opening in Jerusalem and on the eve of al\-Nakba anniversary, the day on which over 700,000 Palestinians were forced to leave their on homes during the Palestinian war in 1948, 58 people have been c [onfirmed dead](https://twitter.com/MOH_PR/status/996133965802233856) , including at least 5 children under 18, and 2771 have been injured\.

During this time, Israeli authorities have [reportedly](http://www.mezan.org/en/post/22819/With+Thousands+Wounded%2C+Israeli+Authorities+Deny+Entry+of+Palestinian+Medical+Delegation+to+Gaza) prevented a Palestinian medical team from the Ministry of Health \(MoH\) in the West Bank from entering the Gaza Strip\.

**Syria**

[MSF report](http://www.msf.org/en/article/syria-newly-displaced-syrians-face-multiple-challenges-idlib-and-northern-hama) that over 60,000 people have recently arrived to Idlib and Northern Hama having been displaced from their homes in other parts of the country\. Many are in need of medical attention and are undernourished\. Local healthcare facilities and MSF are struggling to cope with caring for the new arrivals\.

**Libya**

Reports of torture and detention in Libya continue\.


> After many months in the hands of the smugglers, we were intercepted at sea, sent back to Libya and put in detention again\. After few days, we ended up in the hands of the smugglers again\. Reported by [UNHCR Italia](https://twitter.com/unhcritalia/status/996037776444452866?s=21) \.

And yet we see no positive action towards preventing returns to Libya, or active support by authorities for those who have survived\.

**Sea**

[Salvamento Maritimo](https://twitter.com/salvamentogob/status/996036459508445185) rescued 2 boats with 45 people in the Alboran Sea today\.

[Aegean Boat Report](https://www.facebook.com/AegeanBoatReport/posts/345842449272199?hc_location=ufi) states that 2 boats arrived on Lesvos this morning, carrying a total of 109 people\.

For two days the search and rescue vessel Augusta [was no allowed to land](https://twitter.com/danilocampailla/status/995981576214319104?s=21) on Italian shores and was running out of drinkable water by the time they were finally allowed to dock with the 19 people they had rescued\.

**Greece**

**Islands**

The Migration policy Ministry is considering expanding the current centres on the islands in order to house new arrivals, according to [local media](http://www.ekathimerini.com/228595/article/ekathimerini/news/government-considers-boosting-capacity-of-refugee-centers) , which will put additional pressure on structures which are already dysfunctional and dangerous\.

6,632 refugees are believed to have crossed into Greece in April and 16,478 people in the first five months of the year\. 9,375 arrived on the islands and 7,103 from the Evros border in northeastern Greece\.

Dimitrios Vitsas’ Immigration Bill will be voted on tomorrow \(15\.05\.18\), only two days after the decision by the CoE, which annulled the decision to lift the geographical restriction of the refugees on the islands\. The Minister of Immigration Policy D\. Vitsas has tabled a new bill in Parliament entitled “Amending Asylum Procedures and Other Provisions”, trying to bypass the CoE’s decision and speed up the asylum procedure, which could enable the mass deportation of refugees\.

The new law will look at the EU\-Turkey deal and would include changes to asylum policy, such as a person losing their place in the asylum system if they cannot attend their asylum appointment or do not receive the answer on time\. It could also affect people’s ability to apply for a status of vulnerability\.

There will be a demonstration in Athens tomorrow \(15\.05\.18\) at 7pm, Syntagmatos Square, [called by solidarity groups](https://www.facebook.com/events/213828565874784/) of Athens\.


> The struggle for free movement and equal treatment of refugees and immigrants is the only answer\. 





[Local media](http://www.ekathimerini.com/228632/article/ekathimerini/news/greek-court-turns-down-appeal-against-asylum-decision) report that the Athens Administrative Appeals Court has once again decided in favour of a Turkish Serviceman whom the Migration Policy Ministry wish to deport\.

This is the second such decision relating to the eight servicemen that fled Turkey following the failed coup attempt in July 2016 and is continued proof that Turkey is not considered a safe country for those vulnerable to state persecution\.

He will remain in a securely guarded place and is prevented from travelling\.
