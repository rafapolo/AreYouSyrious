### Greece

A 26 year old Syrian is facing a 44 year imprisionment for steering a vessel\. This Thursday he awaits the finals decision, after he was sentenced in February 2020 for unauthorized entry and facilitating the illegal entry of other people\. Borderline Europe [summed up the case](https://www.borderline-europe.de/unsere-arbeit/lesbos-26-j%C3%A4hrigem-syrer-drohen-44-jahre-haft-weil-er-das-boot-steuerte?l=en&fbclid=IwAR21zBZK8sXGabRJvfZW2qYY7n6cLG9kxmtqkdh-c5bS38GtOHGlDucJ_M4) and demands Greece and the European Union to stop criminalizing people for seeking refuge\.

In another case, the European Court of Human Rights \(ECtHR\) ordered Greek authorities to guarantee a Syrian man with disabilities and chronic health issues “living conditions and medical care appropriate to his state of health, in order to prevent imminent irreparable harm”, the Legal Centre Lesvos [states](http://legalcentrelesvos.org/2021/09/22/press-release-greece-suspends-deportation-following-european-court-of-human-rights-grant-of-interim-measures/?fbclid=IwAR2puU552aa_44b-VnKW86A-dc0bUNNDq86VppNbHQo3uNXwsUL6Fls9L0s) \. Authotiries suspended his deportation for six months\. Also his residency restrictions were lifted, so he was able to leave the island together with his primary caretaker\. Previously, authorities had rejected his asylum application, claiming Turkey was a safe country for him and considered a deportation\.

Quoting Interior Vice Minister Arnoldas Abramavičius, this is a consequence following no requests at border checkpoints\. Belarussian authorities prevent people from reaching them, he said\. Since early August, Lithuana pushed back around 2200 people to Belarus, allowing only 80 to enter the territory\. Some 4100 arrived to country so far this year\.

Witnesses say, she had already crossed the border with he husband, three children and another woman\. After they arrived in a village, a local called border forces who pushed the group back, taz [writes](https://taz.de/Tote-an-polnisch-belarussischer-Grenze/!5802600/) \.

Federal police is preparing for a further increase of border crossings\.
### Netherlands

The District Court of The Hague ruled, that racial profiling by the Dutch border police is not discriminating, PILP [writes](https://pilpnjcm.nl/en/dutch-court-allows-racial-profiling/?fbclid=IwAR2MoI8gLPJgL_KhF83AX3Zx0QcKs1QH2KLfdj2kK46JYa4dFPfnf-WWmmg) \. Civil organizations criticized the ruling a “highly disappointing” with harmful effects for affected people — especially people of color\. They can now be legally controlled based on their skin or appearance\. However, this practice is against international laws and disrespects Article 1 of the Dutch constitution\. Lawyers working on the case want to appeal the decision\.

More than 11,000 people have [signed a petition](https://campagnes.degoedezaak.org/campaigns/layan-en-karam-blijven-hier?utm_campaign=rgrEwHzpT8&fbclid=IwAR1Bhb0dVNL9MNRav191rDVaFg-E48tJjD_XoMovlNr1sMmAsjFCofbteJk) for a Syrian family living with a Moroccan father to get a Dutch residence permit after living five years in the country\. Authorities argued, the family should ask for asylum in Morocco\.

### Portugal

Portugal is welcoming girls of the Afghan national football team\. After a weeks\-long odyssee, the group finally managed to escape the Taliban regime on Sunday\. Around 80 people arrived in Lisbon, 26 youth team members and their relatives, according to [Irish Examiner](https://www.irishexaminer.com/sport/soccer/arid-40703426.html?fbclid=IwAR15LEbdDx-HugQWEyO8LvBtGiDbiaMo4pup6Wgc9892Auj2fe1jLN5POxU) and several media reports\. Hoping to live in a safe environment, they want to continue to play football\.
### UK

87percent of applications submitted under the Afghan Relocation and Assistance Policy \(ARAP\) in the UK have been denied, Byline Times [reveals](https://bylinetimes.com/2021/09/22/87-of-afghan-relocation-applications-rejected-by-uk/?fbclid=IwAR0IVkizAA2V9wrrih2akxHa0_3n7eP3FILv-jqZ_Z6cSCd9-sMFodrcZtA) \. The scheme was implemented in April 2021 to resettle Afghan individuals, which have worked for the British military and government\. However, until 31st August less than 8000 of the 60,000 applications have been approved\. 7000 more applications were lodged after, but only 200 processed so far\. Through the Afghan Citizens’ Resettlement Scheme \(ACRS\), another programme inspired by the Syrian resettlement, the UK promised to actively resettle 5000 people in the first year and up to 20,000 in the coming years\. It is not possible to apply for this scheme\.
