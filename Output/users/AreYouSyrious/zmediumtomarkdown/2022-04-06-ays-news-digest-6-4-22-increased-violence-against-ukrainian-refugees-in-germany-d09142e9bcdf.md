**TURKEY**

[**Four Afghans stranded in north\-western Syria**](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20220404-four-afghan-refugees-are-stranded-in-syrias-idlib-after-being-deported-by-turkey/?fbclid=IwAR3jtWH0BIr_9dp0KoPxAgcwqFxaIGIwBcFHZSgF-_R8wUDccQODWH_WemI) **after they were deported by Turkish authorities**

The young men \(Khiyali Gul, Nasratullah, Safiallah, and Attaallah\) spoke with Middle East Eye\. Following the Taliban’s takeover last August, the young men fled from Jalalabad and made it to Ankara, Turkey\. They were then found by Turkish authorities and the men informed the authorities they were Afghans\.


> “The police caught us and we were persecuted … We begged them to send us to Greece\. They said they would send us to Greece or Afghanistan but they sent us to Syria\.” — Nasratullah 




Upon arrival in Syria, they were arrested and detained for a month before the opposition militant group Hay’at Tahrir Al\-Sham released them\. This was only after they had finally convinced the group that they were not Iranian agents, and they supported the Syrian revolution\.

They are currently living in hiding, trying to gain enough money to cross into Turkey and then into Europe\.

There have been multiple reports of Syrians being deported back to Syria from Turkey, and this is also not the first time non\-Syrians have been deported to Syria\. A previous [AYS Special](ays-special-from-turkey-deportations-to-syria-e2ea70e20b14) explains in further detail the circumstances for many refugees in Turkey\.

**FRONTEX/EU External borders**

Fabrice Leggeri, Frontex Executive Director, talks about [his concerns of human trafficking and gun smuggling](https://frontex.europa.eu/media-centre/news/news-release/fabrice-leggeri-we-are-concerned-about-human-trafficking-and-gun-smuggling--ZU83Tk?fbclid=IwAR24bvDnpOxhFREzLdA_iBE55Dptc-mABDTIRL50tMa25VS0xv1HkoerULA) on the borders between Ukraine and its neighbouring countries\. He further discusses how Frontex has supported these neighbouring countries in the last few weeks, since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine\.

**The hotspot approach, intended to be a temporary method of managing increasing numbers of asylum seekers in Greece and Italy, has now become a permanent element of EU migration policy**

[An article by Josepha Close](https://internationallaw.blog/2022/04/04/the-eu-policy-of-containment-of-asylum-seekers-at-the-borders-of-europe-1-the-hotspot-approach/?fbclid=IwAR0zh2B19AcgHoQJsGlA-ea1awNVO83I2-n8FzNr8uB59uYSUJjRHcAt1-Y) , in the International Law Blog, details how reception and identification centres \(RIC\) have transformed from temporary functions of movement to a mechanism of containing asylum seekers, with a greater intention of return\.

They were initially set up in 2015 as a response to the increasing numbers of asylum seekers attempting to reach Europe, and aimed to be used in conjunction with methods of relocation\. The 2015 Agenda on Migration listed the European Asylum Office and Frontex as agencies who were responsible for supporting member states\. The initial RIC, Moria, Lesvos, was set up in October 2015, followed by others on Chios, Samos, Leros, and Kos, and then in southern Italy in 2016\.

Josepha explains that in Italy the registration centres have tended to continue with the approach of migrants passing through rapidly, staying no more than one or two days\. However in Greece, following the EU\-Turkey agreement in 2016, any asylum seeker who did not apply for asylum or who received a negative decision on their asylum claim would be returned to Turkey\. The RICs became essential throughout the asylum process, as asylum seekers now needed to apply for asylum in Greece before moving on into Europe\.

As a result, whilst fewer people travelled to Greece from Turkey, the numbers of people staying in the reception centres awaiting their decision grew exponentially\. Conditions in the camps deteriorated, they became overcrowded, leading to even greater tensions between those staying in the camps\. Over the years, there have been multiple reports of human rights violations, and individuals being deprived of their basic needs\.

**UKRAINE**

**AYS and many organisations and media outlets have reported on the racism experienced by non\-Ukrainians fleeing Ukraine**

[This article](https://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-war-african-students-face-russian-missiles-and-racism/a-61356066?fbclid=IwAR0usBI13zHpjZljFX9bMYFsJDOvsiMr1VXd3QO696wkJ_oHHjxBzTxBtZY) details the experience of Olufunmilola Bamidele, a Nigerian post\-graduate student who had to flee Ukraine, and her experiences of racism along this journey\. She talks of racial discrimination at train stations and bus stops, and was fearful of being rejected and discriminated against\. There have been multiple stories of African, Indian and Arab students left stranded and prevented from getting on public transport to flee\.

**ITALY**

[**Italy using human smuggling laws to criminalise and imprison refugees and asylum seekers**](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-60492918)

Refugees and asylum seekers are charged using weak evidence, and they often lack access to adequate legal support\. It has also been reported that minors have ended up in adult prisons\.

**In 2016, [over 1,500 were pushed back from North Macedonia to Greece](https://www.ecchr.eu/en/press-release/ecthr-mass-pushback-refugees-greece-idomeni/) , being forced through a hole in the fence by armed officers\.** The ECtHR found that this mass pushback did not violate their rights\. The group of refugees were staying in horrific conditions with no access to state support in a camp in Idomeni\.


> “There is no justice for the eight plaintiffs and the hundreds more unnamed victims of this illegal and violent pushback\. The violence, the degradation, the denial of individual rights remains unpunished\. It’s a bleak day for those in search of protection and for human rights protection in Europe,” adds Karl Kopp from PRO ASYL\.

**GERMANY**

**For the first time, Germany has halted the deportation of people to eastern European nations**

All 16 states have said they have [suspended deportations to Ukraine, Russia and Moldova](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/39655/germany-halts-deportations-to-eastern-european-countries?fbclid=IwAR24bvDnpOxhFREzLdA_iBE55Dptc-mABDTIRL50tMa25VS0xv1HkoerULA) until further notice\. The vast majority of states have also temporarily halted deportations to Poland, Romania, the Czech Republic and Slovakia\.

[**InfoMigrants**](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/39698/germany-reports-of-more-attacks-on-ukrainians?fbclid=IwAR1KR3KsuiHsZuiLYy3ZExkoBSaClK-83azS8VmpN1zspPWNcDz6J5K-p_o) **reports there has been an increase in violence against Ukrainian nationals since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine**

Since the end of February, there have been 109 offenses against Ukrainian nationals\. Furthermore, at least nine cases of sexual assault against women have been reported, and in western Germany, individuals pretending to be police officers robbed a Ukrainian family\.

**ALGERIA**

1693 people have been sent from Algeria to Niger on 20 and 22 March, raising [the number of individuals expelled to Niger to 5069 since the beginning of 2022](https://alarmephonesahara.info/fr/blog/posts/mars-2022-arrivee-d-autres-convois-d-expulsion-situation-precaire-a-assamaka-et-dans-les-villes-du-niger?fbclid=IwAR2qsXj1QfuxUEg6Il5UCjuKGQhkDw92sm4b_d0Ilv6U_5efNzFIh323Qfo) \.

Alarm Phone Sahara have stated there are increasing concerns and risks for these individuals, particularly those who have not yet been fully taken care of at the IOM camps\. Reports have shown a lack of food and medical equipment assistance in Assamaka, along with deteriorating conditions in other cities, such as, Arlit and Agadez\.

**FRANCE**

Utopia 56 has created 10 proposals for political leaders to provide a more supportive, dignified and unconditional welcome to refugees and asylum seekers\. This comes in the midst of an election period and aims to encourage a reconstruction of the reception system in both France and across Europe\.
