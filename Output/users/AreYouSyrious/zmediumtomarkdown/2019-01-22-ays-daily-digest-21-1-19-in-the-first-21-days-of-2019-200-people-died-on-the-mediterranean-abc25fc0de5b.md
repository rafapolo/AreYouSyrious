[IOM](http://news.trust.org/item/20190121164900-nmbcn/) also stipulates that in the first 16 days of 2019 the number of sea arrivals reached 4,216 people, compared to 2,365 people in the same period of 2018\.

The urgent need for Sea rescue is only growing\. Humanitarian groups need EU support, not smear campaigns and refusal for accommodation\.
### Libya

Human Rights Watch released a new report on Monday 21st January with the information they received in interviews with detainees in Libya from 4 July to 12 July 2018\. They were only allowed access to four immigration detention centers in Ain Zara, Tajoura, Zuwara and Misrata, yet all interviews were conducted without guards present\.

Their **first key recommendation** from their findings: Libyan authorities must end arbitrary immigration detention\.


> “Neither the complexities of international migration nor the myriad challenges facing Libya today excuse the brutality visited in Libya upon migrants, asylum seekers, and refugees\.” 




### Sea

From Sunday morning to Monday evening, [Alarmphone](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1087470402845241344) tweeted a disturbing thread on the latest from a distress call from at least 100 people on one boat trying to reach Italy from Libya, only to be returned by the Libyan Coast Guard\. They were also in contact with a group of 150 people on the cargo ship LadySham who were terrified of returning and threatening to commit suicide\.

The last reporting stipulated that from the first case, 106 people were disembarked in Al\-Khums on Monday and that the 150 people are still on LadySham\.

[Alarmphone](https://www.facebook.com/watchthemed.alarmphone/photos/a.1526182797655958/2298257453781818/?type=3&theater) also reported on two distress calls in the Aegean over the weekend, where one man died\. 53 people \(including seven women and 10 children\) landed on Farmakonisi islands and the Greek Coast Guard found one deceased man\. Later, 25 people \(including nine women and five children\) called in distress as water started entering their boat\. They were also picked up by the Greek Coast Guard\.

[1,200 people](https://twitter.com/alzoubeidi/status/1087383431816925186) arrived to Spain last week from Morocco\.
