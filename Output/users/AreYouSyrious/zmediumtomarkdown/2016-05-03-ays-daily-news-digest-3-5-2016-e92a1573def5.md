#### Serbia
### Volunteer with refugees in Serbia\.


> _Belgrade is still an important transit point\. Many refugees arrive here from Macedonia and Bulgaria and try to organize their further travels through Hungary or Croatia, but the effects of the border politics are directly visible here — several hundred people are stuck here and new groups arrive every day\. Most of them are left even without the possibility to get shelter, proper food or information\._ 





> _A group of transnational activists, established a support structure in Belgrade, a mobile kitchen to provide people with warm food every day and preparing abandoned homes as improvised shelters\. Their focus is rather not on humanitarian aid but to cook together with the refugees, protest together, and learn from each other\._ 





> _In the next few days many of our group have to leave and only some will stay in Belgrade\. In order to continue this work we need more people to come to Serbia as soon as possible plus in the long term\. There is a flat where you can sleep or take a rest and create new ideas\. If you come, consider donations \(money is most important since we can buy all ingredients in local shops, but used \(smart\) phones would be great\! \) \. For working together with the local structures it would be best to stay for a longer time, at least one week\. You can contact us either per e\-mail: refugeesupportserbia@riseup\.net or to phone: \+381 61 202 46 74\._

#### Italy

**700 refugees whose bodies are lying on the bottom of the sea, will finally be buried\.**


> _Tomorrow, the Italian military navy will re\-start the rescue operation, to recover human and material remains of the shipwreck that occurred on the 18th of April, 2016, in the Sicily Channel, with 700 people on board\._ 





> _The operations were cut short after the event due to dangerous weather conditions\._ 





> _The wreck, lying 370m deep in the sea and 85 miles from Libyan coast, will be lifted and transferred by the 9th of May to the NATO platform in Siracusa\. Once there, the platform will be able to extract the corpses of the victims\._ 





> _They victims will then be examined by the experts of the Laboratory of Anthropology and Forensic Odontology, to find out further information about the identity of the refugees\. The bodies will be then buried in Sicilian cemeteries\._ 





> _So far, according to IOM, 1,357 migrants have died in the Mediterranean Sea and towards the European states, from the beginning of the year\. In 2015, there were 1,733\._ 




### Smugglers accused of causing the deaths of refugees and exposing others to great danger\.


> _A police team from Agrigento’s police Headquarters arrested two possible migrant smugglers of a dinghy that reached Lampedusa on the 18th of April\._ 





> _That day, 108 migrants reached the island, while 6 had died along the way\. The arrested people, Seri Sar and Diaw Abdou from Senegal, would be accused not only for the 6 people who were on the dinghy, but also for the shipwreck and the previous death of 28 migrants during the transportation, which has ensured zero safe conditions\._ 





> _The scenario of the event is as follows\. The vessel had 136 people on board\. In order to recall the attention of a ship, some people moved to the front of the dinghy, thus overloading it\. The wooden planks broke and damaged the tire and the ensuing panic caused the fall of some people into the sea, some had suffocated under the stampede, and others threw themselves in the sea, after the flame that came with the contact of sea water mixed with gasoline\._ 




### Talk held on solutions to the refugee crisis in Europe\.


> _Laurent Muschel \(Director for Migration and Protection, within the General Direction of Migration and Internal Affairs of European Commission\) states today, “There is no unique solution to the crisis, but rather a variety of solutions: from borders’ control to improvement in asylum procedures, repatriation and relocation\.” He underlined that the migrants’ flow is unpredictable, since in Italy they increased in winter and decreased in spring 2016\._ 





> _Muschel urges Italy to improve the capacity of detention in the identification centres \(CIE\), now limited to 250–270 placements, against the 1,300 foreseen; in 2015, Italy received 156 thousand arrivals, and only 6 thousand repatriations, meaning that CIE’s capacity is definitely inadequate\. In the end, he hopes for an amendment of Dublin’s agreement, for more equal rules\._ 





**101 refugees arrive to Italy from Lebanon, making the third group of refugees to come to Italy as part of a pilot program active since February\.**

> _Immediately after their arrival at Fiumicino airport at 7 a\.m\. on an Alitalia flight from Beirut, the refugees were accompanied by border police to a dedicated area in the arrivals terminal where each of them would begin the long process of entry procedures, including identification with digital fingerprinting\. The refugees will be taken to a special area in the airport where they will then be transferred to various locations throughout Italy, where they will be hosted in reception centres\._ 





> _After the little Syrian girl Falak, who had cancer, arrived in Rome last February 4 with her mother, father, and younger brother — which opened the first legal gate into Europe — another group of 93 Syrians came to Rome on February 29\. In all, about a thousand refugees are expected to arrive over the next two years, not only from Lebanon but soon also from Morocco and Ethiopia\._ 





> _The arrivals are part of a pilot project that allows people escaping from war or who are in a “vulnerable condition” \(victims of persecution, torture, and violence; families with children; single women; elderly; sick; disabled\) to legally and safely reach Italy without risking their lives on the Mediterranean\._ 




### A communal charity event for refugees to be held in Italy\. Let it be an example\!

#### France
### Refugee children are back to school\!

They have had some amazing feedback from the refugees and the incredible volunteers who have been teaching and have loved every minute of it\._

> _The events came amid decision by the Australian immigration department to shift detainees out to other mainland facilities, a worsening mental health crisis in the offshore processing centres, and the sudden partial collapse of Australia’s offshore processing policy\._ 





> _Immigration minister Peter Dutton on Tuesday accused activists and detractors of being responsible for that happening, telling the refugees Australia would change its policy\. He stressed that refugee suicides won’t change anything\. The following are his words\._ 





> “I have previously expressed my frustration and anger at advocates and others who are in contact with those in regional processing centres and who are encouraging some of these people to behave in a certain way, believing that that pressure exerted on the Australian government will see a change in our policy in relation to our border protection measures,” Dutton said\. The government would not be swayed by public pressure, protests, or acts of self\-harm\. “We are not going to change those policies, and the advocates, by providing false hope to these people, really \[are\] to be condemned,” he said\. “They can provide offers of support, that is reasonable\. But to provide advice otherwise is very dangerous\.”
