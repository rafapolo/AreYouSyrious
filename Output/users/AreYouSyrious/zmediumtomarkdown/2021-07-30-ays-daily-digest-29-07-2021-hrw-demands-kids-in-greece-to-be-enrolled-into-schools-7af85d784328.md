### Greece

The Greek Migration Ministry has [announced](https://migration.gov.gr/xekina-ton-septemvrio-i-leitoyrgia-tis-neas-kleistis-elegchomenis-domis-samoy/?fbclid=IwAR0WxxwLvXwbROJWx1dajaltSI6wmqjzmBbeKxlrmbGHSmxrdbjSs6j9HbU) , the new closed camp on Samos will start operating by September\. Others on Kos and Leros will follow this year, Lesvos and Chios next\. They are completely financed by the European Commission\.

Human Rights Watch [demands](https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/07/29/greece-stop-denying-refugee-children-education?fbclid=IwAR31rsEwPvjt6hnBsQygSJexEwrUAj4sNIISg7XQOFgArpIeup5TNyOsnLA) the Greek government to provide access to education to all children seeking asylum in the country\. ‚ÄúOnly 1 in 7 children living in camps was able to attend school in the last school year,‚Äù the organization criticizes and suggests to hire teaters, arrange transportations to school and not block them from schools due to the pandemic\. Of more than 10,000 children on the mainland, 86 percent were not attending classes in early 2021 ‚Äî and only seven of some 2100 on the islands\. ‚ÄúThe future of tens of thousands of children who fled to Europe for safety depends on the decisions taken now by Greek and European Commission officials,‚Äù [Bill Van Esveld](https://www.hrw.org/about/people/bill-van-esveld) , associate children‚Äôs rights director at Human Rights Watch\.

While the Greek Migration Ministry celebrates itself for having increased the number of beneficaries of the Helios integration programme from 6000 in 2019 to almost 32,000, NGO‚Äôs and volunteers remind that it has been slammed by EU and international actors for not being in line with EU standard\.

The migration ministry has appointed consortia of construction, facility management and cleaning companies to take over these camps.

Nine workers and two managers of a printing book company in Italy have been arrested for illegally hiring foreign workers, InfoMigrants [reports](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/33949/italy-arrests-for-gangmastering-at-firm-that-prints-harry-potter?fbclid=IwAR2kmWK7c77Gjkd5LFYThSABc2V0Vo09qMzJqEeSM6hIiBvG7JXIPvKyKrs) \.
