### Afghanistan


> There is a common problem seen in most of the returnees who are living alone in Kabul without any support is the difficulty to access the support packages, which is meant to be provided to those who are deported back to Afghanistan after submitting relevant\. 





The [Afghanistan Migrants Advice & Support Org](https://www.facebook.com/AmasoAfg/photos/a.1419588361404777/2351814634848807/?type=3&theater) provides support to deported returnees in Kabul and reports about insufficent structures to assist those in need\. Recently, they met a man who was separated from his family in Sweden\.
### Greece

Yesterday, refugees and volunteers of different non\-governmental organizations came together in the main square of Chios Town to remember a 9\-year\-old girl that went missing four days ago and is believed to be drowned\. The girl and her family were on a boat carrying 52 people from Turkey to Lesvos when she fell overboard\. ‚ÄúSafe passage for all‚Äù and ‚ÄúNobody is forgotten\. In remembrance for those lost a sea‚Äù, the volunteers had written on their banners\. The small vigil in the square was accompanied by a minute of silence, a song on the guitar and poems read out by participants\. Over 30 people came to pay their respects to those who lost their lives in the Mediterranean Sea\. ‚ÄúThe killing in the Mediterranean Sea continues every day\. We are here to demand ‚ÄúSafe passage for all‚Äù and to make sure that those who lost their lives trying to reach Europe will not be forgotten‚Äù, a volunteer reported\.

### BALKAN WEATHER REPORT 16‚Äì17/02
#### Montenegro

Predominantly sunny, in the morning fog in the basins\. Wind weak to moderate blowing from changing directions\. Lowest temperatures from \-6 to 5 and highest daily from 10 to 19 degrees/
#### Serbia

Locally light frost in the morning, fog in the basins and alongside the rivers\. Wind weak from changing directions\. Lowest temperatures from \-4 to 2 and highest daily from 10 to 15 degrees\.
#### BiH

Sunny throughout the country, in the morning there could be fog in the basins in Bosnia\. Wind weak blowing from the west and northwest\. Lowest temperatures from \-4 to 6 and highest daily from 9 to 17 degrees\.
#### Croatia

Predominantly clear and above average temperatures for the time of year\. Wind mostly weak, alongside the coast northwestern and western, the highest temperatures mostly from 13 to 18 degrees\.
### Bosnia

Police from the Bihac region are persistent in the violation of freedom of the movement of refugees and migrants in Bosnia\. Since the end of October, police are preventing people coming from Sarajevo to Bihac or Velika Kladusa, where most of the people who come to Bosnia are heading in order to try to cross the border to Croatia and continue their journeys\. The decision is made despite the existing laws in the country, but so far nothing is changing\. IOM and UNHCR, who are in charge at the moment for the well being of people on the move in Bosnia, are not putting enough pressure on government to end this practice\. The only help provided at this point comes from the local red cross, citizens of Kljuc and nearby villages, and occasional visits of international volunteer groups\. Nevertheless, more and more people are stopped every day\. Among them seriously sick people\. On February 14th, 35 persons were at this check point\. On other days, every day between 10 to 15 people are stopped here\. People who are stopped in some cases are trying to reach the north of the country by foot, which in Bosnia now is not safe due to snow and bad weather\. Others try to go back to Sarajevo\. All of them paid for the ticket from Sarajevo to Bihac, and they get no money return if stopped and thrown out by the police\. Usually people in Kljuc collect money and pay tickets for them to go back to Sarajevo\. This weekend, one person donated 200 euros to cover bus tickets for people whose freedom of movement was violated\.

### Croatia

According to the media headlines, a new civic initiative fighting the build\-up of the refugee camp was established in Petrinja\. It is planned to set up the camp at the margins of the town, in the previous refugee settlement in Mala Gorica\. The authorities could have access to 4 million Kuna for building the reception center for asylum seekers, but the citizens stand against it\. This is one amongst many protests by local communities when it comes to the refugee camps and reception centers\. We can recall similar protests in 2004 in Stubiƒçka Slatina\. The MoI dropped the idea of building the reception center over there, lost financial means ensured through the EU funds and opened the reception center in an old MoI facility in Kutina\. Town authorities of Petrinja and state institutions could have learned some lessons from the decisions and practices implemented in other places such as the Italian town of Riace that has utilized EU funds for integration of refugees to advance the life quality of the whole population \(integration addresses both the domicile and the new\-coming population\) \. In addition, it is worth mentioning that Mala Gorica is a remote area, isolated from the town of Petrinja, and far from the social life and amenities necessary for the integration of the newcomers\. This represents a huge challenge that could create a negative impact on asylum seekers and their families and on society too\.
### Slovakia

With only 160 asylum applications in 2017, the country received the lowest number in the EU that year\. However, the situation in the dentention centers is described as similar to prison by four human rights treaty bodies of the United Nations, ECRE [reports](https://www.ecre.org/global-detention-project-slovakia-punitive-conditions-paid-for-by-the-detainees/?fbclid=IwAR1BYzt3nUP1G4iptA7uPDjFzoUjM8_PTBaRmReXWPIcAMWQwAAvudl53eU) \. Even ‚Äúfamilies with children are systematically detained, that detainees are required to pay for the costs of their own detention, and the fact that the presumption in favour of majority is applied to unaccompanied children‚Äù\.
### France

Volunteers in Calais and Dunkirk are in urgent need of sleeping bags\. After having seen more than 100 evictions last month, they are looking to collect 3000 sleeping bags and 5000 blankets over the next days\. On 27th February, a truck will stop at the different drop off points in London and the week after in other locations around the UK\. Find more info on their [homepage](https://helprefugees.org/news/sleeping-bags-needed-calais/?fbclid=IwAR3FeW71d4mTD2wNpXgawe47zcGPo_OxW42AQFW2Ii2GsAFXev5TZBZhzEc) \.

Also in Paris teams are in need of new supplies\. Un petit bagage d‚Äôamour [asks](https://www.facebook.com/UnPetitBagageDAmour/photos/a.1776832529198970/2262972480584970/?type=3&theater) for baby milk and diapers size 1 and 2\.

Additionally, Utopia will host an [information meeting](https://www.facebook.com/events/1988627621246621/) on Saturday 23rd February, about the long\-term accommodation of unaccompanied minors\.

Solidarit√© migrants Wilson published a list of upcoming activities:

### Austria

The Afghanistan Migrants Advice & Support Org received confirmation that Afghans have been deported from Austria to Kabul\. The number is not known yet\.
### Germany

According to information of the [Bavarian Refugee Council](https://www.fluechtlingsrat-bayern.de/beitrag/items/id-21-sammelabschiebung-nach-afghanistan-bayern-will-familie-trennen.html) , the Bavarian interior ministry is planning another deportation to Afghanistan on Monday\. They know about five people, among them is only one criminal: a Christian who was a member of a secret church\. During his asylum interview he did not mention this, because he was afraid the translator could use it against him\. ‚ÄúIn case of a deportation he is in danger of dying,‚Äù the Refugee Council writes\. In another case, the man has been in a relationship with a German woman for more than two years and they have a child\. He could not ask for parental custody, as he was taken into detention before the appointment\. There will be a demonstration against deportations in Munich on Monday\.
