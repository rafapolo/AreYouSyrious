#### FEATURE
#### Horrible Conditions in Saint\-Denis Camp on the Outskirts of Paris

France has entered another lockdown to protect public health as coronavirus cases increase\. However, concern for public health does not extend to people on the move\.

On the outskirts of Paris, [over 2,000 people](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/28324/situation-about-to-explode-in-locked-down-paris-migrant-camp?preview=1605010225958&fbclid=IwAR2DJXBeGdacGM0mcyZzV5o1q8qnoDY98qQQmeEisj20G1xyisBcF92JsDQ) are sleeping in the tent city of Saint\-Denis, some of them families with young children\. Conditions in the Saint\-Denis camp were unbearable even before the lockdown\. Some people do not even have tents to sleep in and are forced to sleep in tarps on the ground\. People are going hungry and cannot access regular food distribution points so they rely on the work of organizations like Solidarité Migrants Wilson\.

Life in the informal camp is even harder now that there is a lockdown and coronavirus cases are rising in the city\. The people do not have access to [soap, masks, or regular showers](https://twitter.com/MortazaBehboudi/status/1326193396906602496?s=20&fbclid=IwAR2ggVO6V5jidyy6Wuic0JE9rR_Dv_e0TK7WVfXtqdhQBDvuAjPGPMCJUr0) \. Even though the camp has been there for months, washroom cubicles and urinals were only recently installed and there are not enough facilities to serve the thousands housed there\. Under France’s strict lockdown rules, people are only allowed to move around with a permission form for a few accepted reasons, most of which do not apply to people sleeping rough\. Thus, people on the move could face heavy fines if they attempt to access regular food distribution points in other neighborhoods\.

It’s no surprise that under these conditions, tensions are rising\. The people and their allies are demanding that the government do something after months of inaction\. Already, one person has needed emergency medical attention after suffering a cardiac arrest\. How many more people will suffer?

Most galling is that this situation is completely preventable\. Most of these people wound up in Saint\-Denis due to the French police’s practice of pushing people out of the center of the city and into the poorer suburbs using aggressive evictions, often at night\. The goal is to push people out of sight and out of mind\. If people were provided with dignified housing from day one, there would be no need for any of this to happen\.
#### COTE D’IVOIRE
#### More People Fleeing Cote D’Ivoire Due to Election Unrest

[More than 8,000 people](https://www.unhcr.org/news/briefing/2020/11/5faa5ac74/unhcr-expands-aid-ivorian-refugee-numbers-top-8000.html?fbclid=IwAR1Ov4Cn-xUB6PYn0rkOnN4I0jXWZ9moqWrcNTRu1CKSHFp4YEmy0ekBCUk) have left Cote D’Ivoire due to tensions around the current presidential election\. Most have gone to the neighboring country of Liberia\.
#### IRAQ
#### Iraqi Government Closes 7 Camps, Leaving 100,000 People Homeless

The government of Iraq has [shut down seven more camps](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-54873830?fbclid=IwAR3b0KnfWI8JCWTsrzNd3QR27q5IaVEemgAsj5-PbL0DaahpojpEwmXQKLg) , following their plan to shut down all camps for internally displaced people\. However, the people who had been living in the camps had almost no notice, do not have the right security clearance to return to their homes, and many do not even have homes to return to since many areas have not been rebuilt following their destruction by IS\.
#### LIBYA
#### Zintan Detention Center Is Closing

The hellish Zintan detention center is closing\. On Tuesday, people on the move [began dismantling the shelters](https://twitter.com/AndreaGagne/status/1326151184764243969) in the camp\. However, the situation for people on the move in Tripoli is very dangerous and they will have little protection or support as they transition to life outside\. One Eritrean [man was killed](https://twitter.com/sallyhayd/status/1326298842132844545) by a gang member in Garagesh, an area in Tripoli where many people on the move have been staying\.

In addition to violence from organized criminals, people on the move in Libya are vulnerable to state violence as well\. The authorities carried out a [mass expulsion to Sudan](https://twitter.com/saracreta/status/1326125523538485254?s=20&fbclid=IwAR3vYXlnC5V2kzdtZMyEOeyBmIRTrup0RzrlYMKWyUkR6u0u6TJHsJzOsIw) without actually processing people’s cases\.
#### SEA
#### Dangerous Days on the Mediterranean

Many people have been in distress or, worse, shipwrecked in the Mediterranean over the past few days\. [110 people in distress](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1326021506019840000?s=20&fbclid=IwAR1JXTU_LGPLMgvbDiRLNiWQa5Vs4O_z6I3nCWSJTPglZcJlopvKgR6jFao) contacted AlarmPhone from the Maltese SAR zone, thankfully, they were able to reach Lampedusa safely\. [100 others](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1326142005487996931) in two separate boats contacted AlarmPhone in distress from international waters\. Open Arms later rescued [88 people in distress](https://twitter.com/openarms_fund/status/1326260681079918592?s=20&fbclid=IwAR1dGVxGPGhDPeHpurwEJ4FR9vPEX3Hu1oszatFfqrpTXRFr8fHftrTBpss) in international waters, but it’s unclear yet if these are the same people that contacted AlarmPhone\. Salvamento Maritimo rescued [118 people in distress](https://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20201110/49384703901/salvamento-lleva-a-118-inmigrantes-de-dos-barcazas-a-gran-canaria-y-tenerife.html?fbclid=IwAR2mm2BwV83YT_lZJkiXdeWVnUTvEvE26AL1oGqQDUyJYZ8yGcy6Xs7hfro) and brought them to the Canary Islands\.

The fate of people who were towed by the Greek coastguard yesterday is still unknown\. The coastguard [refuses to tell AlarmPhone](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1326129436228538372?s=20&fbclid=IwAR3wg4I9cZH1k6RG8fMQNuJVTe60oHD8R68DqpZdPWYBpXak80vE7N4tE4M) where they brought the people and if they found a port of safety in Greece at all\. Did they conduct another illegal pushback?

Thirteen people have tragically died off the coast of Libya, including one child\. The deaths and dangers at sea must stop\. As [Jesus Espinosa puts it](https://twitter.com/_jesusespinosa_/status/1326228196816285704) , “this is the other pandemic, and one without a vaccine\.” There is a “vaccine” — providing people with safe ways of reaching Europe and seeking asylum — but the EU is unwilling to consider it\.
#### GREECE
#### “There Is No Situation Which Is Critical” Says Mitarakis About Victoria Square

In response to a question about the people sleeping rough in Victoria Square during an [interview with InfoMigrant](https://twitter.com/InfoMigrants/status/1326171000615006214?s=20&fbclid=IwAR2crZ2V-zySjE6MuM7PTbQyuvtwc8VCubQuMQPrFC56Ob6Ci66CjRZ58hA) s, Migration Minister Notis Mitarakis claimed that “there is no one in Victoria Square today and there is no situation which is critical\.” To say that “there is no situation which is critical,” when until very recently there were thousands of people homeless directly as a result of government negligence, is misleading\. Even if there were no people in Victoria Square at the time of the interview, this framing minimizes the crisis Mitarakis’ government caused\. Later in the interview, Mitarakis admitted that most people had wound up in “temporary” camps when the stated point of the policy was to fix overcrowding in the camps\. The fact that a government initiative backfired so drastically and so many people are now back in camps or have become homeless instead of being placed in proper accommodation seems fairly “critical\.”

Other key takeaways from the interview include Mitarakis’ claim that some people wanted to come to Greece for “a big house, a job for life, and unlimited support” \(they didn’t\) and that Afghanistan is a safe country for return \(it isn’t\) \.

The Greek Minister of Citizen Protection responded to the EP Committee on Civil Liberties’ investigation into the murders at the Evros border in March by saying “ [such accusations are groundless](https://twitter.com/bellingcat/status/1325818520542851080?fbclid=IwAR1hwZS66UYCcSg0OquCQMcR0EJ_9D2UvCIBoRAtouDHuFYLlaqKk-Y1rb8) \.” While the letter says they are ready to investigate, the fact that the government has dismissed bountiful evidence prepared by Bellingcat and other investigative journalists does not bode well for the integrity of the investigation\.

In a smaller tale of government machination, a company that manages parking spaces [received a grant](https://twitter.com/TihomirSabchev/status/1326134335548891136?fbclid=IwAR3CqzHgR6M7mNbxsC7D3xUuDk-n9hCLywDDGeOMsEcrVL7ABd6LeF-0CpY) from the EU’s Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund \(AMIF\) for a reception project\. One has to wonder about the details of this deal — even if everything is clear, legal and honest, what experience does a parking company have with providing dignified housing to people on the move? And how is the EU vetting the people and companies that receive its funds?

The Golden Dawn trials are now finished, but the aftermath is still playing out\. [Two former members](https://twitter.com/VassilisTsarnas/status/1326255415483650059?fbclid=IwAR1JXTU_LGPLMgvbDiRLNiWQa5Vs4O_z6I3nCWSJTPglZcJlopvKgR6jFao) with close ties to the police were charged for the attempted murder of five antifascists two and a half years ago\. However, they have disappeared, raising questions about police complicity\.

Sixty people have been stuck on an island in the Evros River [for over 20 hours](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1326166500512845824?s=20&fbclid=IwAR0lQKpN7IES15xkH3_XVtuYsG0xvXGPQiYAJxr-k1WSCBPApiq-JNJVwN8) according to AlarmPhone\. They have not had access to food or fresh water for over two days, and both Greece and Turkey are refusing to conduct a rescue\. At the time of writing, they have still not been rescued\.

[_No Name Kitchen_](https://www.facebook.com/NoNameKitchenBelgrade/posts/1118474778550805) is continuing their important work in Patras\. They have distributed food, hygiene products and blankets to people living in the three abandoned factories near the port\. Four youth that they work with have experienced police violence: one was detained for four days in a bare cell with no cause\.

#### CROATIA
#### Culture of Silence Around Croatian Human Rights Violations

Despite the years of well\-documented violence committed by Croatian police against people on the move, and the advocacy of observers and individual politicians like Austrian MP Nurten Yilmaz, little has been done to stop this by the EU or other European states\. People suspect it is because most of the victims are Muslim, and because Croatia has silently been given the mandate to “protect” Europe’s external borders, by any means necessary\.

As recently as 2020, Horst Seehofer said “I have absolutely nothing to criticize about the security authorities in Croatia\.” [This article](https://www.ard-wien.de/2020/11/10/vor-aller-augen-bruessel-berlin-und-co-ignorieren-kroatische-grenzgewalt/) offers a detailed recap of the violence at the Croatian border, the attempts to draw attention to it by NGOs, people on the move, and individual politicians, and the lack of response by high\-ranking officials\. While the EU ombudsman has launched an [official inquiry](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/nov/10/inquiry-launched-into-eu-commissions-protection-of-migrants-at-croatia-border?fbclid=IwAR1Ov4Cn-xUB6PYn0rkOnN4I0jXWZ9moqWrcNTRu1CKSHFp4YEmy0ekBCUk) , little has been done in the way of concrete action\.
#### ITALY
#### Even Stricter Border Controls Planned

The Italian government have [announced](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/28410/tighter-controls-for-migrants-implemented-in-lampedusa?preview=1605004469180&fbclid=IwAR3CqzHgR6M7mNbxsC7D3xUuDk-n9hCLywDDGeOMsEcrVL7ABd6LeF-0CpY) that they will be implementing stronger identification and screening procedures on the hotspot of Lampedusa following the terrorist attack in Nice\. Any new procedures will have to be streamlined to stop a bottleneck from happening on the already congested hotspot\.

The government is also working with France and Tunisia to increase border surveillance by creating joint border patrols and [using Italian ships and planes](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/28404/ships-airplanes-to-search-for-migrant-boats-off-tunisia?preview=1605002764447&fbclid=IwAR2mm2BwV83YT_lZJkiXdeWVnUTvEvE26AL1oGqQDUyJYZ8yGcy6Xs7hfro) to search the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Tunisia\. When there is a need to rescue people in distress at sea, there is no will or capacity to do so, but suddenly surveillance is possible\. Both of these proposals show how European governments use terrorist attacks opportunistically to justify further crackdowns on people on the move\.
#### SPAIN
#### Overcrowding, Crisis Brewing on Canary Islands

[Over 2,200 people](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2020/11/10/refugee-crisis-brews-on-spains-canary-islands-with-new-arrivals?fbclid=IwAR1cWLem7vHw2sOuI0a8H0RfIty70SbVuiZhODULSzlW9Y0yBG8C4J1O4rc) arrived on the Canary Islands this weekend, breaking records for arrivals in a 48\-hour time frame\. The hotspot is already overcrowded\. Over a thousand people are sleeping outside in tents, exposing the government’s lack of preparation\. The crowded conditions make it impossible to observe even the minimum of COVID precautions, and yesterday alone [54 people tested positive](https://www.canarias7.es/canarias/hacinamiento-arguineguin-impide-20201110203456-nt.html?ref=https%3A%2F%2Ft.co%2F&fbclid=IwAR25ZRSrzu9ZdZl8q1GKRWRceMyi46HxHxgkMjD1gkAY58zNs-nSYhaMN1E) for coronavirus\.

The president of the Canary Islands asked the national government for help, saying that the region cannot manage on its own\. He criticized the government, saying they need to transfer people to the mainland instead of treating the Canary Islands as a de facto [prison camp](https://cadenaser.com/ser/2020/11/10/sociedad/1605018986_447441.html?ssm=tw&fbclid=IwAR3MdGVETgASp2BpuD8D0K6Gm0xaJucOUnHbhFjX3eLhMACBIk75pFFW4QM) \.

This is emboldening the rise of far\-right groups like the Vox party, which could seriously endanger people on the move\.

Meanwhile, the Spanish government launched [its first deportation flight](https://cadenaser.com/ser/2020/11/10/sociedad/1605018986_447441.html?ssm=tw&fbclid=IwAR3MdGVETgASp2BpuD8D0K6Gm0xaJucOUnHbhFjX3eLhMACBIk75pFFW4QM) since the start of the pandemic\. Twenty\-two people, mostly from Senegal, were deported from the Canary Islands to Mauritania via charter flight\. No independent observers were present\. If deportations were canceled at the start of the pandemic, why would the government choose to restart them now, as cases across Spain skyrocket?
#### FRANCE
#### Harassment in Calais

People were [evicted from four places](https://twitter.com/HumanRightsObs/status/1326238609616347137?fbclid=IwAR1Ov4Cn-xUB6PYn0rkOnN4I0jXWZ9moqWrcNTRu1CKSHFp4YEmy0ekBCUk) in Calais and Grand\-Synthe this morning at around 2am\. Two people were arrested and many had their belongings seized, including tents, blankets, and winter coats, and the Human Rights Observers team was cautioned\. These evictions, conducted every 48 hours, are part of an [intentional strategy](https://twitter.com/HumanRightsObs/status/1326140622756048896) to harass people on the move\.
#### NETHERLANDS
#### Dutch Government Reexamining Cases of LGBT Ugandan Asylum Seekers

The Dutch government allegedly uncovered an organization that was helping Ugandan people [pretend to be LGBT](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/28401/dutch-government-cracks-down-on-ugandan-asylum-seekers-after-fake-lgbt-claims?fbclid=IwAR1ai7CEm9KZWO_1BksdsWs8KvHHdO3L68b-D-tZYQB8FzlVoFqdoR0xvP8) so they could seek asylum\. They said that they are now implementing stricter measures to uncover fraud\.

However, those stricter measures are far more likely to hurt actual LGBT Ugandans, who will be in serious danger if deported, than they are to stop any so\-called criminal activity\. It’s unclear if they are culturally sensitive to the ways coming out narratives may be different in Uganda vs the Netherlands, if they are trauma sensitive, or at all attuned to the needs of asylum seekers\.
#### UK
#### Stressful Conditions Cause Alcohol\-Related Problems for People on the Move

[A study](https://www.ed.ac.uk/news/2020/action-urged-to-ease-refugees-alcohol-plight?fbclid=IwAR37BOa3rwKpw11Htne2u7uLCopDxfcjvRn0cPB-Wt2TDNPaaCgdTPELmpc) by the University of Edinburgh found that most people seeking asylum in the UK that suffer from alcoholism or other related problems did not experience these problems before\. Instead, they were triggered by the stresses of the UK asylum system, including long waiting times, uncertainty, and poverty\. The study suggested several easy ways to fix this problem, such as allowing people to work while waiting for their decision to come through and providing more support\.
#### EU
#### European Parliament Adapts Mechanism on Enforcing Rule of Law

A resolution championed by Slovak MEP Michal Simecka that creates a mechanism to enforce rule of law in member states was adapted by the European Parliament last month\. The resolution [strengthens and consolidates](https://balkaninsight.com/2020/11/10/mr-rule-of-law-seeks-to-fix-europes-crisis-in-values/?fbclid=IwAR2crZ2V-zySjE6MuM7PTbQyuvtwc8VCubQuMQPrFC56Ob6Ci66CjRZ58hA) existing mechanisms and creates an [annual monitoring cycle](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20201002IPR88432/parliament-demands-a-legally-binding-effective-mechanism-to-protect-eu-values?fbclid=IwAR1hwZS66UYCcSg0OquCQMcR0EJ_9D2UvCIBoRAtouDHuFYLlaqKk-Y1rb8) for all members’ commitment to the rule of law\. Member states that are found violating certain principles, like compromising their judicial system, could find themselves losing funding\.

It’s unclear yet if this proposal to enforce the rule of law could apply to EU agencies such as Frontex when they violate international law through illegal pushbacks\.

The European Union [will not attend](https://globalnews.ca/news/7454105/eu-russia-syrian-refugees/?fbclid=IwAR04mNWGiuorIz2I3k6sKItX4tl0TTw8Ka0cJWxBKZMn-eVU5DXe6Hb6UBo) this week’s two\-day conference hosted by Russia on the return of people on the move to Syria\. EU officials said that the conference is premature since conditions need to be safe for return before the issue is even discussed \(This is somewhat ironic considering that some EU states do not respect this principle — for example, Sweden started contemplating potential deportations to Syria [over a year ago](ays-daily-digest-1-10-19-sweden-evaluates-deportations-to-syria-49a579ca30f1) \) \. Observers are worried about the effect this conference will have on conditions for Syrians in countries such as [Lebanon and Jordan](https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2020/11/damascus-conference-russian-efforts-pressure-refugees-in-syrias-neighboring-countries/?fbclid=IwAR2ggVO6V5jidyy6Wuic0JE9rR_Dv_e0TK7WVfXtqdhQBDvuAjPGPMCJUr0) \.

[A document leaked](https://euobserver.com/justice/150012?fbclid=IwAR3b0KnfWI8JCWTsrzNd3QR27q5IaVEemgAsj5-PbL0DaahpojpEwmXQKLg) to the Financial Times and Guardian showed that home affairs ministers will announce a declaration this Friday that essentially blames people on the move for not integrating better and also blames them for terrorist attacks that occured in France and Austria\. Points in the draft included “sanctions against people who refuse to integrate” such as by not teaching EU languages to their children and other points to uphold “shared European values\.” A separate draft leaked to the press detailed the European Union’s plan to go after encrypted messaging apps like WhatsApp\.

It’s unclear if the document addresses the barriers people face to “integration,” such as poor access to education, or if it immediately leaps to blaming people on the move\.
