### FEATURE

On Saturday morning, an urgent meeting of the Government Council for Foreign Affairs and Defence was organized by the new Greek Prime Minister Kyrakos Mitsotakis\. In this meeting, a series of new measures was adopted with significant effects on the situation for refugees in Greece\. While some of the new measures can be seen as positive — like the decongestion of the hotspots, especially Moria on Lesvos; the transfer of some 366 unaccompanied minors into safer housing on the mainland or reunification with their families in other European countries; the transfer of 1002 highly vulnerable people from Lesvos to Nea Kavala \(Thessaloniki area\); and support for Lesvos medical staff — other new measures are highly disturbing\.

Not only will police controls for people with rejected asylum claims increase, but also the border surveillance will be radically expanded, in cooperation with FRONTEX, other European authorities and even NATO\. 
But the most dramatic changes will probably concern the new institutional framework of the asylum procedure\. In cases of rejected asylum applications, the second instance of reviewing appeals will be abolished\. The aim is to accelerate deportations\. According to RefuComm, Amnesty International Greece launched a statement of which the following is a part:


> _“Amnesty International is deeply concerned about today’s announcement by the Governmental Council on Foreign and Defense \(KYSEA\) that the second instance of reviewing appeals will be abolished, with the aim of — if the asylum application is rejected — to proceed immediately country from which it originated\. The reforms announced could undermine the legitimacy of the asylum procedure, and deprive asylum seekers and applicants of their right to effective protection, as guaranteed by Article 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 39 of the Asylum Directive\. Asylum Procedures\.“_ 





Other NGO’s and Human Rights activists also expressed their deepest concerns\.

### GREECE

ONE PIECE OF GOOD NEWS FROM GREECE\! 
Finally, the problems of acquiring tax numbers \(ΑΦΜ\) for refugees seem to be solved\. According to Mobile Info Team, the Tax Office in Thessaloniki and the Asylum Office in Athens announced that from now on the tax numbers will be issued on the same day, if all documents are provided\. Before, people had to wait for months to get their tax numbers as they needed to be checked with the Asylum Office\. Tax numbers are necessary to rent houses, get employment or access state services\.

### Islands

News from the **Moria Camp on Lesvos** is getting worse every day, although one would think the worst was been reached a long time ago\. As the numbers of arrivals are increasing dramatically, new people have no shelter anymore in the overcrowded tents but instead have to sleep rough on the street\. Limited access to water, completely inadequate sanitary infrastructure, and long waiting queues for food distribution are still not solved\.

### DENMARK

Demonstrations in front of the Ellebæk detention center, organized by the initiative Luk Ellebæk — Close Ellebæk, were held this weekend\. The participants called for the closure of Ellebaek and proclaimed their support and solidarity to the inmates\. On Sunday morning however, the Danish prison service Kriminalforsorgen pressured them to leave the area before time:


> _“Kriminalforsorgen \(the danish prison service\) pressured us away from Ellebæk by removing the inmates rights to visits and blaming it on us even though our protest was peaceful, legal and approved by the police\.”_

The group gathered again in Copenhagen in front of the Kriminalforsorgen head office and continued demonstrating there\.
### UK

Worrying news from the UK in the case of a no\-deal Brexit, reported by the Guardian\.


> _“The Home Office is preparing to end the current system of family reunification for asylum\-seeking children if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the Guardian has learned\._ 
 

> _The government has privately briefed the UN refugee agency UNHCR and other NGOs that open cases may be able to progress, but a no\-deal Brexit would mean no new applications after 1 November from asylum\-seeking children to be reunited with relatives living in the UK\. Even if there is a deal, the future of family reunion is not certain\.”_

### SWEDEN

In reaction to the worsening conditions on Lesvos, Team Sweden Volunteers want to send some already packed pallets that were originally scheduled for Athens directly to the island\.

### NORWAY

In the Norwegian election campaign, xenophobe slogans are used by the right\-wing party Fremskrittspartiet \(The Progress Party\) \. The slogan of a current poster is “Simplifying The Day — Norway Will Not Accept Boat Migrants”\.
