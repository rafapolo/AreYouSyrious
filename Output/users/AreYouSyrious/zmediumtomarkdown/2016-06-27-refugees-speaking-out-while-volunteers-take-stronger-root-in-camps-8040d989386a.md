#### SYRIA
### ISIS is attempting to regain control of territory through terror as it releases the previously\-unseen video showing the execution of five citizen journalists\.

The journalists were kidnapped [from the city of Deir Ezzor in October,](http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/islamic-state-claims-killing-five-citizen-journalists-syria-1137843804) and the executions happened in November and December\.

US\-backed Kurdish Arab forces are continuing to advance on ISIS territory and are within close range of the ISIS\-bastion of Manjib near the Turkish border\.

This release comes subsequent to the report that Syrian citizen journalist Khaled al\-Issa succumbed to injuries sustained in an IED attack that targeted al\-Issa and fellow journalist Hadi al\-Abdullah on June 17th\. Although they were both initially reported in serious danger of death within 36 hours of the attack, both had made a comeback\. However, al\-Issa passed away late Friday and was buried in his hometown of Kafranbel\.

#### GENERAL
### The plight of pregnant refugee women was recently given broader coverage\.

A piece by Huffington Post’s partner blog The World Post, points out that one out of ten refugees is a pregnant woman\. The situation of forced migration and conflict account contribute to a high rate of preventable maternal mortality, with “ [sixty percent of preventable maternal deaths](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/europe-pregnant-refugees_us_575eba7ce4b0ced23ca88e5e) and 53 percent of under\-five fatalities take place in countries affected by, or prone to, conflict, forced displacement or natural disaster\.”

Comprehensive efforts to lower this frightening statistic must include more robust critique of the systems that is trapping women in these dangerous situations, whether they be economic, social, or border\-imposed\.

MSF’s ship Dignity One [conducted six rescues between the hours of 4:30 AM](https://twitter.com/MSF_Sea/status/747027166324473856) and 1:30 PM on Sunday, saving 927 individuals and delivering them to safe ground\.
#### SERBIA
### Twenty\-nine refugees involved in crash\.

According to BalkanNewsbeat, a driver who had crashed in Serbia’s Sićevo Gorge on the highway form Bulgaria fled the scene of the accident, hoping to avoid prosecution for trafficking/smuggling\. According to local news sources, the truck was carrying 29 asylum seekers\. Some injuries were reported, but no fatalities\.
#### AUSTRIA
### Possible new action on the mysterious Austrian “Pushbacks” that occurred in spring\.

Border crossings Spielfeld reports:


> The controversial practice of pushing back Syrian, Iraqi and Afghan families at the Austro\-Slovenian border crossing at Spielfeld during the early months of this year is now for the first time being challenged in an Austrian court\. 





If a negative court decision were to occur, this case could serve as important precedent for future cases, challenging emergency legislation currently in the works\.


> In the 24 days before the closing of the legal route into Austria on 6 March, Austrian police officers “sorted out“ at least 588 people from the 300–1000trying to pass through every day; they were kept in sometimes questionable conditions and then pushed back to Slovenia without appropriate legal procedures\. 





> These push\-backs started on 12 February 2016, which is 6 days before high\-ranking security officials from Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia andMacedonia \(without the involvement of key players Greece and Germany\)signed the Zagreb accord in an attempt to legitimize \(partly a posteriori\)these practices and to prepare for the eventual complete closure of the Balkan route\.

This last couple of weeks has been full of emotional connections as residence Skype their families back home, many of of whom had spent a long time without communication\. 





> I am collecting Laptops/IPads/Tablets for the growing need of people wanting to get online\.
