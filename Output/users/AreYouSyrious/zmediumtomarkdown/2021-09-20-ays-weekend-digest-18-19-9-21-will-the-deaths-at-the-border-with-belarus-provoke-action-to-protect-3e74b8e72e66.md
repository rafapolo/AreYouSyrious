#### FEATURED

A body of an Iraqi woman has been reported at the Polish\-Belarus border\. Beside her was her family who claimed they were pushed back to Belarus\. Bodies of three other people were noticed at three different border points with Belarus on Sunday, reportedly by locals who went mushroom picking, as the local media wrote\. They then informed the police and ambulance services\. Along with one of those who died, an Iraqi man, were two other people who suffered consequences of hypothermia and are currently in hospital\. 
There are reasons to believe that one of those stuck in the border area and who sadly died there previously tried to reach solidarity networks, different organisations, and individuals who, due to not being present in the area and not having the means to reach out to them, couldn’t help prevent this tragic ending\. This begs the question how can we make sure such things don’t happen, that organisations and journalists are allowed in the area to report and inform the people, but also for humanitarian assistance to be provided for the people passing? It is obvious that the issues at the border will Belarus will not go away any time soon\. We invite everyone to focus efforts into advocacy for support to the local solidarity movements, for the international community to not make the same mistakes as in other parts of Europe, and for everyone to provide help and assistance to the activists in the area\. We stand in support of our Polish friends as they deal with the exacerbation of this situation\.

Polish border guards are currently reporting around 300 daily attempts to cross the border and claim they have arrested over 1,400 people since January, with thousands of others “prevented from entering”\. The pushback procedure is being used as a regular process at the border\. As it has [been reported](https://www.onet.pl/informacje/onetbialystok/sytuacja-na-granicy-migranci-probuja-przekroczyc-granice-kolejne-ofiary-smiertelne/h8v59vk,79cfc278) , a [state of emergency has been in force](https://wiadomosci.onet.pl/stan-wyjatkowy) since September 2 in the border zone with Belarus, in part of the Podlaskie and Lubelskie provinces\. This has made it impossible for organisations to have any access to the area and to take any action\. People are constantly getting stuck in limbo, in the swamps of the Supraśl River, and at risk of hypothermia as the Suwałki region now has temperatures dropping to 0 degrees Celsius during the night, and will continue to have colder weather\.
#### SEARCH AND RESCUE AT SEA
### A bizarre pushback to Morocco

Alarm Phone was alerted to a couple of people stranded on Congreso Island, part of the Chafarinas archipelago in Spain\. They informed the authorities, and afterwards received confirmation from Salvamento Maritimo that the Guardia Civil transferred them to an unknown location\. With the Guardia Civil in Melilla having difficulties receiving updates from their own colleagues on the archipelago, they were ultimately informed that both persons in question had been transferred to a vessel of the Moroccan Navy\.

More than 11,000 people have arrived in the Canary Islands by sea so far this year, which is 117\.3% more than in 2020, [reports](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.europapress.es%2Fislas-canarias%2Fnoticia-mas-11000-migrantes-llegado-canarias-manera-irregular-va-ano-1173-mas-2020-20210917135926.html%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1hruyJyJT0BcTHzv9uc1o7N_vfpaWSw6pzcG-M0RfQ7L0WuUEntJDHt5w&h=AT3kJ8dsnGOEg2kbqXnjX-wR9qk_fIsrKO6Kuyw9qIDcjRBnTceU8yGgjXpMnpoDoB7bNozNLQJdsp8OElNYUbPtmZ0NZn03C6z5ttPWdQzB-cYxL_kYhgnjiKsDARryQX4UML-8JIq-AAEJMuw4W0BScTppTw&__tn__=R]-R&c[0]=AT1n8VlxnPzx4wRcNSERNK0-41EcAV6MNFMsUDAumnhYU4_XOkifwMYFvykuri0CMZahIlnTMris6qkgOYhr2HktsBoFFzqs1eqN1FW-1hY1yua-e1tKKjFg31EogY952kb7PjBIgnNd1Zy8Y_tfDcFtMpJdxRVzcZPpF7BAljIMvTGURR93zML8xStYO-7khtbOTFqrzSIR) say\.

Many people have lost their lives here\. The most recent reported one is the man who [died trying to reach Playa de los Muertos](https://www.lavozdealmeria.com/noticia/3/provincia/222156/muere-un-migrante-cuando-intentaba-llegar-en-patera-a-la-playa-de-los-muertos?fbclid=IwAR3mthPCi2u97h3xutIXr2HVHxautOX-oqB0VCAoLL1q6p_e0WcqbOq7qjA) by boat, in the Almeria municipality of Carboneras, where another person died falling off a cliff just a week ago\.

After @resqship monitoring vessel Nadir encountered an overcrowded wooden boat with approximately 60 people in distress drifting in the Maltese Search and Rescue \(SAR\) zone, they provided first aid and alerted all responsible authorities\. Following that, since the Maltese MRCC denied its responsibility once again and Nadir had no capacities for the rescue, they alerted the nearest SAR crew and finally, the Ocean Viking rescued the 58 people\.

Following the two rescue missions of this weekend, Ocean Viking was alerted to 2 other wooden boats in distress in the Libyan SAR Region by Colibri2 aircraft\. Both were intercepted by the Libyan coastguard as witnessed from afar by their teams\. 
More than 800 people were intercepted this week and returned to Libya by the coastguard\.

Of course, the UN has [“expressed concern](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.libyaobserver.ly%2Fnews%2Fun-concerned-over-thousands-immigrants-vanishing-libya%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR10S-j-97BQsUdxIXdJvyowbvLJ5pGTG4SvFP68CynD9rJw3V42Es_YKIE&h=AT3QUTJdnR7jRITzTuYnzs5LqSbcNzE3p0GTlD3o91wZHHLZhWyy4LhPTyaD_t3q7ir254A0ZAal1uBieUapQdKo_PBdZyFuo9QpuQKWhk0Y-u0qwYm4QEmD3SxNmFbzMKGGvvq4iPtrsMilRkM0NLU5ppoySQ&__tn__=R]-R&c[0]=AT1ni8aP8ioNZrkvMAbA8-3MZhu_ca8utgdbiy4IhjUtZ0MQUI7eYuWpjDirbl53f_7A-f4oXXBgpgLH8SjMMopq3s1M-ZYQk_v5eDlOuCqi4nWusSqQAcNz4lPzvtq6nxy58FT8jMFOJmNMOahu9PotTmZc4n4EAFBEHUcPuTcfoL49vloeUrC_m34JqKuqVXt0OBEZ0nRMfYQcQkw) ”, but given their lack of action and complicity in the returns, there is not much to be expected from them\.

During the second rescue operation they encountered 33 people on a wooden boat in distress in international waters off Libya, who were safely brought onboard, including 8 women and 13 children\.

Two survivors with chronic medical conditions are under close observation\.

### Fire and pushbacks on Samos

19 asylum seekers from Somalia and Sierra Leone were pushed back from Samos, despite the fact that they were officially announced to all competent authorities, including the UNHCR\. They also applied for asylum, but, as we know, that fact means less and less across the EU\.

_“Billed as a state\-of\-the\-art facility, authorities told us it’ll be a model for other countries\. Yet the people we spoke with awaiting transfer there tomorrow don’t want to move to a closed camp”,_ writes Petra Molnar\. Securitisation also plays a big and important role in the whole setting of the new camp:

Back on the mainland, as reported by the local media, the Greek Solution is preparing their candidates in Evros in the next elections\. Among the possible candidates, apart from K\.

> There has never before been a deportation agreement between the Danish government and Iraq, so the government has not been able to legally deport Iraqi refugees without the individual signing deportation papers\. Whether this remains practice is uncertain in light of the fact that an Iraqi delegation is coming to Denmark\. The delegation plans to talk to the detainees, with a view to deportation, but it is unknown what the consequences will be\. The precarious situation creates fear among the prisoners and their families as well as in the camps in general\. “What’s going to happen now?” is a thought that weighs heavily on everyone’s mind\.

### Solidarity with Simba

Protesters gathered in front of the Sheffield hospital, demonstrating against the injustice of the NHS system that resulted in a young man having to pay 100,000 pounds for emergency medical help that he received during a stroke \(at the age of 29\! \) in 2019\. As a rejected asylum seeker, he had been rejected for a reportedly simple and inexpensive medication that could have prevented him from suffering the stroke\. Now, many people and organisations in Sheffield and across the UK are protesting for an end to the charging of people on the move and asylum seekers for NHS treatments\. These practices are only a part of a range of “hostile environment” policies rolled out between 2014 and 2017 that aimed to restrict access to public services and make life in the UK more difficult for undocumented people\.
