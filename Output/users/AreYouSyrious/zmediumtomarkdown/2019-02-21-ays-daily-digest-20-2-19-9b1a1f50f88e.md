Frontex released their annual report this week on what they call “irregular migration”\. The title of the report is “Risk Analysis for 2019,” and in it they discuss the “pressure” faced by EU nations due to refugee arrivals\. Yet nowhere in their analysis do they address the dangers faced by those who are at the greatest risk: the refugees seeking to cross European borders\. These people face constant violence and abuse from Frontex and other EU\-funded border police\.

One of the findings in the report is that there has been a “dramatic drop in the number of migrants on the central Mediterranean route, where the number of detections \[from 2017 to 2018\] plunged 80% to 23,485\.” As the report itself acknowledges, the reduction in the number of people crossing the central Mediterranean is largely due to the aggressive actions of the Libyan Coast Guard: “ **the sudden uptick in activities by the Libyan Coast Guard in July 2017 was one of the key variables in irregular migration to Europe that changed from 2017 to 2018\.”**

What is not acknowledged in the report is that this “sudden uptick” in the number of interception and forced returns by the Libyan Coast Guard \(LCG\) did not happen on its own\. It is the result of increased funding and cooperation from EU nations, and Italy in particular\. The EU continues to fund the LCG and support their transfer of refugees to detention centers where people are tortured and even sold into slavery\.

You can read the [summary](https://frontex.europa.eu/media-centre/news-release/frontex-publishes-risk-analysis-for-2019-Dh6Wkf?fbclid=IwAR1-0bGVmhtKXWNLgJUf5KOHiq9ya0fEmOHJAjXChsmlHCNkMqTUWurq470) of the Frontex report here, or view it in its [entirety](https://frontex.europa.eu/assets/Publications/Risk_Analysis/Risk_Analysis/Risk_Analysis_for_2019.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1h1jJNNOnVPVLxXIjjxImkr0FFL8lMJ8_rAfrrV23No_NvPTZscqMsbuc) \.

### Turkey
#### Erdogan suggests Turkey aims to prevent more refugees from entering country

Turkish president Erdogan announced this week that the country will not be able to [“shoulder another wave of migration](https://www.trtworld.com/turkey/erdogan-turkey-no-longer-able-to-face-new-refugee-flow-24306?fbclid=IwAR1Rw6JBSuatydOL-Ud3k76pnBg2EEAwOrxs8i0jTkhscu5d-ed1e2gS9d4) ”\. Any move to create further restrictions for refugees trying to move through Turkey could have drastic consequences for millions of people\. Erdogan said in his address that he would not move to create more physical barriers around the country, as this was not an effective way to prevent migration\. According to the Turkish interior ministry, [268,000 people](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/15294/turkey-268-000-undocumented-migrants-apprehended-in-2018?fbclid=IwAR0II5JbT5bOTOXpMJMqQdHYKrWI-apw420B9LhmbcUl6dWJ1QWpkTRK3KE) were apprehended and detained in 2018\.
### Greece
#### Demonstration planned in response to death of Nigerian man

There will be a protest and press conference tomorrow in front of the Omonia police station in Athens\. The demonstration is in response to the killing of a Nigerian man named Ebuka who was beaten to death in the Omonia jail by police, as reported in yesterday’s digest\.

#### Cold front and snow starting on Friday

A cold front is arriving in Greece [this week](https://greece.greekreporter.com/2019/02/20/greece-braces-for-more-snow-as-cold-front-barrels-from-the-north/?fbclid=IwAR1mX8Rk3qZ5fFa0fNS8oRris2gcDdErLStoy4k5xZCjYnJsgqlD4ynf2ao) , with temperatures expected to drop rapidly starting on Friday\. Snowfall is expected throughout the country this weekend\. Anyone who is sleeping exposed to the elements is warned to take precautions\.
#### Demonstration In Thessaloniki \(via No Borders network\)

There was a demonstration today in Neapoli, Thessaloniki, in response to last night’s attack against an Iraqi family living in the city\. A Molotov bomb was thrown at the family’s residence\.
#### New welfare program announced

Greek authorities announced the creation of a new welfare program this week, which will be accessible to beneficiaries of international protection\. Such assistance is especially needed now, as Greek authorities recently announced that people who have received refugee status will no longer be eligible for UNHCR cash assistance after six months\. You can find more information on the new welfare program [here](https://www.asylumineurope.org/reports/country/greece/content-international-protection/social-welfare?fbclid=IwAR1UKN6NYEJkXYk_C7syA7ocV6iD0Phc2nlQ-RNzB6BufWoWyd8oHGgY1bg) \.

### Bosnia
#### Bosnian media amplify anti\-refugee rhetoric

Bosnian media outlets associated with right\-leaning political parties, and in particular the TGE media network, have been releasing a slew of anti\-refugee reports\. These stories are often based upon highly exaggerated statements from Bosnian officials\. For example, yesterday a number of news outlets picked up a statement by Bosnian Security Minister Dragan Mektic that [70,000 refugees](http://www.ansamed.info/ansamed/en/news/sections/generalnews/2019/02/19/bosnia-alarmed-over-70000-migrants-ready-to-leave-greece_8e4d3b5a-c00f-4d4b-aa5b-e10b1b41e13c.html?fbclid=IwAR0ob1XJDYon2duln3jZDaH4sTUjjyIl7Xoz2PjyQELiNNbSChsiPzF2S88) were preparing to leave Greece via Bosnia\. Inaccurate stories like these are closer to hate speech than actual news, as they aim to spread fear and anti\-refugee sentiment based on misinformation\.
#### No Name Kitchen announces return to Bosnia after their papers are sorted out, AidBrigade returns to Usivak camp

Several international volunteer groups have encountered problems with Bosnian authorities after their legal status expired and some of them failed to extend their registration papers or to register NGOs in Bosnia\. For this reason, No Name Kitchen, SOS Team Kladusa and other groups had to pull out some of their volunteers who are EU residents\. No Name Kirchen, an international group that provides free showers for people in Velika Kladusa in cooperation with AYS and MSF, has published an update announcing their return to Bosnia after their papers are sorted out\.

### Belgium

MSF Belgian released a report today based on their interviews with many asylum seekers in the country\. Among their findings:


> ➡ ONLY 4 of the 47 people surveyed had the intention to go to the UK from the beginning of their journey\. 





> ➡ ONE PERSON OUT OF four attributes his psychological problems to experiences lived in Europe \(mediocre living conditions, uncertainty about the procedure to follow, police behavior…\) \. 





> ➡ MSF, with the other partners of the hub, advocates for a more fluid application of the Dublin regulation and the creation of reception and orientation centers for this group of people\.
