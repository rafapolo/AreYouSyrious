#### Feature story — Denmark: leaving human rights behind, one law at the time

In the last few years — and in the last months especially — Denmark has been drifting away from human rights protection, especially regarding asylum seekers\.


> “An increasing amount of complaints against Denmark are taken to the UN Human Rights Committees, and many end up voting against the Danish state\. Also, the European Court on Human Rights in Strasbourg has several times found Danish laws to be in breach of their articles\.” _\(from [Refugee\.dk](http://refugees.dk/en/focus/2019/february/the-massive-danish-discrimination/?fbclid=IwAR1WFNyoz9p8Q3yA6-YsrGRnvb6I57gDfzfNfwM-ZyKSgEXxPzPWMjQWqh8) \)_ 





In reaction to this, the Danish government and the Social Democratic Party are insisting on the right to discriminate, with calls to rewrite international conventions and diminish the power of human rights courts\. **In the preparation of new bills, the intention to violate certain human rights is explicitly mentioned\.**

An \(incomplete\) list of discriminatory legislation has been published by [Refugees\.dk](http://refugees.dk/en) , read it [HERE](http://refugees.dk/en/focus/2019/february/the-massive-danish-discrimination/?fbclid=IwAR1WFNyoz9p8Q3yA6-YsrGRnvb6I57gDfzfNfwM-ZyKSgEXxPzPWMjQWqh8) \(in English\) \.

Local media sources have been reporting on the story of Mohammed Anowar, an asylum seeker of the Rohingya minority in Myanmar\.

After having lived for 7 years in the northern European country, always in a state of bureaucratic limbo, he was told on Wednesday the 31st of January that his work permit had been withdrawn and that he had to move to the deportation centre in Kærshovedgård within 7 days\.

For the last 6 years, the Danish state has not been willing to recognise him as a refugee\. Danish authorities state he is from Bangladesh; Bangladesh states he is from Myanmar\. Myanmar does not recognise Rohingya people as citizens\. **The authorities have unsuccessfully tried to deport him to both Myanmar and Bangladesh\.**

Mohammed Anowar “didn’t seem to care about where Denmark will send him”, as long as he could get out of the Danish asylum system\.


> “Of course I want to go back\. All Rohingyas want to go back to Myanmar, so if the police can send me there, that will be fine\. If they can send me to Bangladesh, that’s fine too, but I’m not from Bangladesh”\. 





He has had to quit his job and leave his apartment\. Failure to present himself to Kærshovedgaard on time could have meant detention\. **But** **living in the deportation centre means not being allowed to work, volunteer, or receive any form of cash assistance** \. He will be able to use the centre’s canteen 3 times a day, and he will be required to return to the centre every night and report to the police 3 times a week\.

328 people have already fled Kærshovedgår centre, trying to reach other countries, to avoid being deported to their country of origin, local media [report](https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/regionale/midtvest/ahmad-reza-forsvandt-fra-kaershovedgaard-kirkeasyl-i-tyskland-giver-ny?fbclid=IwAR0qh86BkdxyJ8f0sLORM7LE8C8nnB3VbRPd7xyCkh71UxE_IMKOYCEGWgo) \. They are only a small percentage of the 3177 missing asylum seekers that the Danish authorities cannot find\.

One of them has recently contacted [volunteers in Denmark](https://www.facebook.com/deportedfromdenmark/posts/603369373459313) from the streets of Paris:


> He’s freezing, scared, hungry and deeply unhappy\. His safety as an unaccompanied minor in Denmark disappeared when he was questionably assessed 18\-years\-old and old enough for being sent back to Afghanistan, despite the fact that he is an orphan\! 





> He has now taken the escape to the street in Paris, where he stays freezing along with hundreds of other rejected young people from countries like Denmark and Norway\! 





> **Common to all of them is that they would rather freeze to death on the street in Paris than be sent to Afghanistan\.** 





TURKEY
#### Updates on the attacks in Esenyurt, Istanbul

As we [reported in our last Weekend Digest](ays-weekend-digest-9-10-02-2019-5-years-on-and-people-keep-dying-at-europes-borders-1a56fe429146) , clashes broke out in Esenyurt, Istanbul between Syrian refugees and Turkish people\. New local media [reports](https://www.demokrathaber.org/guncel/esenyurt-ta-suriyelilere-toplu-saldiri-4-yarali-h112912.html?fbclid=IwAR2MjfTTf4TcRMa2xIqV27aq8byei2n4rb4ptIdizMaI50QZr8uaSDYL2ZA) have suggested that Syrian workplaces have been the target of mass attacks by groups of Turkish people shouting “This is Turkey\.”

According to witnesses, at least 4 people were injured in a knife attack\. After the fight, 3 Syrians were arrested by riot police\.

LIBYA
#### Testimony from the slave trade in Libya

Kombini News published a video \(in French\) with the story of Alpha Kaba, from the Guinea Conakry, a radio journalist who was kidnapped by a Libyan militia and sold as a slave multiple times to work in plantations\. He speaks about his story and his escape from the Libyan hell through the dangerous Central Mediterranean crossing\.

The behaviour of [IOM \- UN Migration](https://medium.com/u/664cb26312d4) and [UN Refugee Agency](https://medium.com/u/75f2bdd89854) in Libya has too often been ambivalent, denouncing the situation in Libya and at the same time refusing to take any action\.

TUNISIA
#### People in reception centre told to leave because of new arrivals

Journalist Sally Hayden [report](https://twitter.com/sallyhayd/status/1095372756244402177?fbclid=IwAR3D1IiYtCEkQCysFUS35syaMDzpymmr6vrxp-tIA7UeKzBJVa_6PKrJ91E) s that some refugees have been paying between $600 and $800 to be smuggled from Libyan detention centres to Tunisia over the past few months\. Those who’ve been there for a while say that they are now being told to leave their accommodation to make space for new arrivals\. Hayden reports that they are frightened because it isn’t clear where they should move and whether they will be able to access any services\.

MOROCCO
#### Authorities destroys Sub\-Saharan migrants’ shelters in Nador region

[AMDH Nador report](https://www.facebook.com/AmdhNador/photos/pcb.2272541622958100/2272541599624769/?type=3&theater) that the authorities in Nador have destroyed the shelters of sub\-Saharan Migrants living in an unofficial camp in a forested area\. Many of the forest camps are already very empty as the inhabitants were recently arrested\.

_An inhumane obstinacy against men, women and children who live in very difficult forest conditions\._

SEA

While Italian authorities keep shouting about how they have curbed migration flows, and stopped people from endangering their lives by attempting to cross the Mediterranean, three boats left the Libyan coast in just one day\. The first, carrying 132 people, was intercepted by the Libyan coast guard, as we reported yesterday\. The second, with more than 100 people on board, was “rescued” by a cargo ship which returned them to Libya\.

[Alarm Phone report](https://www.facebook.com/watchthemed.alarmphone/photos/a.1526182797655958/2311970032410560/?type=3&theater) on the fate of 62 people on the third boat\. They too were returned to Libya by a merchant vessel\.


![Alarm Phone was called from the sea by survivors of a Mediterranean crossing while they were being returned illegally to Libya on a merchant vessel\. As so many others before, these 62 people were deceived by the crew and told they would be brought to Europe\. \( [Watch the Med — Alarm Phone](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1095372905771425792?fbclid=IwAR1i_JiUV-WwEXuBhCrvu-k2Gu57lWWKXX3sScoAouoOnjLBBPYzmZcP_Fw) \)](assets/7247e7c54213/1*zQWNIsOPODrqp06myWxg-Q.jpeg)

Alarm Phone was called from the sea by survivors of a Mediterranean crossing while they were being returned illegally to Libya on a merchant vessel\. As so many others before, these 62 people were deceived by the crew and told they would be brought to Europe\. \( [Watch the Med — Alarm Phone](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1095372905771425792?fbclid=IwAR1i_JiUV-WwEXuBhCrvu-k2Gu57lWWKXX3sScoAouoOnjLBBPYzmZcP_Fw) \)

Alarm Phone have referred to this as ‘commercial refoulement\.’ Other groups such as Jugend Rettet are equally angered and saddened by the border policies and governments behind these manoeuvres and have discussed the case as a form of ‘push back’\.

**These practices, as we have stated many times before, are illegal under international and EU law\.**

Even [IOM \- UN Migration](https://medium.com/u/664cb26312d4) , who do occasionally also return people to unsafe countries, have [stated](https://twitter.com/fladig/status/1095327142102085632?fbclid=IwAR3upDl9PAfIyBJnHDKRYEB_SodVo6aEZqmSJYVXv-MY8QMk4IaYgOgGlB8) that:


> Migrants rescued in international waters should never be sent back to Libya, which is NOT a safe port\. 





Around 200 people had been returned to Libya in less than 24 hours, among them, a high number of pregnant women and children\. Where will these people give birth? Where will these children grow up? In detention, in Libya\.
#### 3 people rescued in the Canary Islands sea

Salvamento Marítimo has [rescued](https://twitter.com/EPCanarias/status/1095238717340635137?fbclid=IwAR1xYiB3LuhV6UY1wgP9pHkeObLG_NdYl3WejCL2zyHDg6AyW29ecaz4LOE) a boat south of Gran Canaria with three people aboard\.
#### Moonbird finally back in the sky

Humanitarian Pilots Initiative HPI [report](https://www.facebook.com/humanitarianpilotsinitiative/photos/a.1564914920480338/2004411946530631/?type=3&__xts__[0]=68.ARCP4KDWqDSkKGiik6Y9RhVq8rhsjhWnrUwxt_HYPYKiE4_H1cf59dH7L7dZQTP3ijMwMKm7xdV9OfptHWp__5avy6xRRH7SkndVHkOMSBX-ZfdMhcTkDNJpMADT5nBV--dpJTcFfniJgeGJiLpAtYc6wU11dLrZ8Ek0Qg-sm9kkpEb5z6TDjmOqz_twd1yP9ZQXHbKEuMkcoeISocMv0gpnAow2vZV4PCP3oeH3IwAOsJ9_h4Q84SJAu37rLGOe4VbTuSr7nbrJJbB1CY4B9_T--wvTcWjEzwfCDRoJXt5Io649kgERii5Djt7g9kcMjdx6RDYVOgVWkNBvNo-Gqqgphqnq&__tn__=-R&hc_location=ufi) that Moonbird is in the air again and already on the way to the Mediterranean after maintenance work\. But their partner Sea Watch 3 is still being held in the port of Catania for alleged “technical irregularities\.”

John Bayer, chairman of Sea Watch, states:


> Our task is to save people in distress and to bring them to a safe place as soon as possible\. With our ship, this place is available quickly from every position in the Mediterranean, and we are prepared for that\. It was the European governments who delayed the landing of rescued people too long, not us\. They force us to take people in for weeks, and then blamed us for not being a hotel\. 





CYPRUS
#### New Cyprus profile on the Statelessness Index

The [Cyprus Refugee Council](https://www.facebook.com/cyrefugeecouncil/posts/389559638275565) has launched a new country profile on Cyprus as part of the Statelessness INDEX in partnership with the European Network on Statelessness\. More info [here\.](https://index.statelessness.eu/country/cyprus?fbclid=IwAR2hyrMKoGEYlSwqKd65DZ4t9UE-MPaKj1tvEybyFJd_dWcF6HK7EJN85CU)


> A stateless person is someone who has no nationality\. Statelessness is a legal anomaly that affects over half a million people in Europe — both recent migrants and those who have lived in the same place for generations — denying many their \#fundamentalrights\. 





The Statelessness Index assesses how countries in Europe protect stateless people and what they are doing to prevent and reduce statelessness\.

#### New arrivals in Lampedusa

Between Monday and Tuesday, 13 people arrived on Lampedusa\. Police and coast guard arrived after the dinghy had already landed in Cala delle Palme, local media [report](http://www.agrigentonotizie.it/cronaca/lampedusa-sbarco-immigrati-minori-febbraio-2019.html) \. 5 minors were in the boat\. All the 13 people were taken to the hotspot in the Imbriacola area, where they will be registered\.

UNCHR published arrivals data for the week 4–10 February 2019\. Read it [HERE](https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/67930.pdf) \.
#### Lampedusa, just a strategic military outpost?

[Askavusa Lampedusa](https://www.facebook.com/askavusa/posts/2232442207014798) denounce the expansion of the Frontex and military bases on the island:


> After the fencing of the old airport terminal, which is — in all likelihood — the operational headquarters of Frontex, after the installation of a drone control system near the hangar at the civilian airport and the installation of the new radar in Cape Ponente in areas classified as “Sites of Community Importance”, “Special areas of conservation” by a natural reserve, the fencing of a large area in Ponente by the former Loran station is now being finalised\. 





> Of course, nobody talks about it\. Many continue to do business with military devices \(see hotels and restaurants\); no reaction either from the local administration\. 





> Lampedusa is confirmed to be a great military base, strategic outpost in the Mediterranean and us Lampedusans, a people unable to defend the island they claim to love, but the only thing they are interested in and love is money\.

BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
#### Updates from Bosnia

According to [local media](http://www.rtvusk.ba/vijest/krizni-stab-bih-osobe-koje-su-sklone-vrsenju-krivicnih-djela-izmjestaju-se-u-imigracioni-centar-u-lukavici/27775?fbclid=IwAR0Q9NTrYaXQn10eS7r5Ixettj8yf9tCRe-LLDnqoAehKzljL5uyota4f00) , about 3,900 refugees and migrants in Bosnia are officially in the country at the moment\. At the beginning of the winter, the number was about 4,400\. However, due to the complicated and dysfunctional registration system, many people who have been in the country for a longer period of time are undocumented\. Many are living in squats in different cities or with the local population\.

Officially, over 1,040 entered the country this year\. Volunteers at the border cities with Serbia and Montenegro are reporting daily arrivals\.

IOM is in charge of most of the camps, while the involvement of national authorities is limited to registrations and border control\. Negotiations about greater state involvement are ongoing\. Bosnia had general elections in October last year, but the government is not yet formed\.

New photos from the camp in Bihac have been published by volunteers:

SERBIA
#### Border police in Batrovci employ new scanning techniques to stop people from entering the EU

Info Park Belgrade [report](http://rs.n1info.com/Vesti/a459729/Carinici-otkrili-sedmoro-migranata-u-hladnjaci-na-22-stepena.html) that on February 9, Serbian Customs Officers at the Serbian\-Croatian border crossing at Batrovci discovered seven young Afghans hidden in a refrigerator truck \(at \-22 degrees\) \. According to the officers’ statement, migrants were discovered by a customs scanner which is able to detect human silhouettes in the cargo\. The Custom Officers also stated that for the first month and a half in 2019 customs officers prevented more than 150 migrants from crossing the border irregularly\.
#### People returning from Bosnia due to violence at the border

[Info Park’s field team](https://www.facebook.com/infoparkserbia/) encountered 9 single men from Algeria who voluntarily returned from Bosnia, where they had spent the last 5 months\. The men shared with the Info Park’s cultural mediator that they had experienced physical violence on several occasions in Bosnia, as well as while trying to cross the Bosnian\-Croatian border\. They stated that the repeated violence and continued fear have taken a toll on their mental health and ultimately lead to their decision to return to Serbia\.

> Mrs\. Hidalgo, it’s time to act\. 





They state that makeshift camps continue to crop up, as housing is inadequate\. As a result, equipment such as tents, blankets and warm clothes is needed\.


> In view of the daily health emergency, we also ask for the installation of toilets, urinals and access to water at the campsites, but also to strongly denounce police violence, confiscation and destruction of equipment, of which we have too often the story from the exiles we accompany\.

IRELAND
#### Racist attack on hotel destined for refugees

A second instance of arson has taken place on a hotel destined to be used as a reception centre for refugees in Ireland, [according to local media](https://www.rte.ie/news/regional/2019/0212/1029015-rooskey_hotel/?fbclid=IwAR3V96HV3lVjFGU2gS1WEPTspkYTJc4Fi0qLC-X0ErudvOc9LLw41DpsrTo) \.
