### Doctors Without Borders \(MSF\) to no longer take funds from EU Member States and institutions


> [_Médecins Sans Frontières \(MSF\)_](http://www.msf.org/en/article/20160617-eu-states%E2%80%99-dangerous-approach-migration-places-asylum-jeopardy-worldwide) _announced today that it will no longer take funds from the European Union and Member States, in opposition to their damaging deterrence policies and intensifying attempts to push people and their suffering away from European shores\._ 





> _This decision will take effect immediately and will apply to MSF’s projects worldwide\._ 





> _Three months into [the EU\-Turkey deal](http://www.msf.org/en/article/europe-dont-turn-your-back-asylum-takepeoplein) , which European governments are claiming as a success, people in need of protection are left counting its true human cost\. On the [Greek](http://www.msf.org/en/greece) Islands, more than 8,000 people, including hundreds of unaccompanied minors, have been stranded as a direct consequence of the EU\-Turkey deal\. They have been living in dire conditions, in overcrowded camps, sometimes for months\. They fear a forced return to Turkey yet are deprived of essential legal aid, their one defense against collective expulsion\. The majority of these families, whom Europe has legislated out of sight, have fled conflict in [Syria](http://www.msf.org/en/syria) , [Iraq](http://www.msf.org/en/iraq) and [Afghanistan](http://www.msf.org/en/afghanistan) \._

#### Greece
### Increase in arrivals to Greece overstrains volunteers’ capacities in the region


> _Lighthouse Relief: At 7\.10 this morning, Portugese Frontex brought in 52 people that they had intercepted at sea as they entered Greek waters from Turkey\. They landed in Skala Sikamineas and were held on the boat while waiting for transportation to the detention camp, but we were allowed to assist with bringing them water, nutrition, diapers, clothes and blankets\._ 





> _We are seeing an increase in arrivals, and we desperately need your support again to upscale our reception and be prepared if there is a new influx to offer many more people immediate relief, assist in finding vulnerable people that need extra protection and distribute much needed water, nutrition and non\-food items after the horrific journey people have taken\. We have kept a high presence on Lesvos while many other organisations left, to support the local residents in cleaning the island and be prepared for whatever might come\._ 





> _Talking to a Syrian family from the boat, they asked how long they would stay in the camps on Lesvos\. We cannot give them any answers on their future\. Now, they will see their children detained in terrible conditions, but at this moment their eyes were filled with relief as it had taken them two months to get here\. ”At least we are safe\. Anywhere but Syria”\._ 





> _To support us in staying here and giving people immediate relief and protection, visit [www\.lighthouserelief\.org/donations](http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lighthouserelief.org%2Fdonations&h=hAQHGJGiuAQFOMA2wbw_o10Piwt0bjuqd1haAxAM1uyZIdQ&enc=AZNHpfGmVRB9jhvg2PcxPLqNPgOtK5dyG4zB_645xipOCAlMlOudVXMUM2uLMh1ANq22sR92aXYDPpw01-TZT_Req9jLrAXkSNJBwxMuBVtgCjLM4WNtZXFP1uDs1MM9JL-5i62Y54noYrOQedA8yY60BgOTFOV0sZFvN6Gvy0bH_kHlqFtRexmAmTPejms01fI&s=1) \._

### Refugee Aid Group Info Park celebrates their 9 months\!


> The 16th of June was a special day for us — it was exactly nine months since our operation was launched\. We remember the 16th of September like it happened yesterday\. Hungary just closed its border and we were wondering if we would make the three months we originally planned\. Nine months later, Info Park is alive and kicking, we work more than ever, have new goals and new achievements\. Last but not least, we have permits for work renewed and valid until the end of 2016 so we are here to stay\. We raised glasses and cheered for that\!

### Refugees arrive to Rome through the Project Humanitarian Corridors


> _81 migrants, most of them Syrian refugees, arrived to Fiumicino airport \(Rome\) this morning from Beirut, thanks to project “corridoi umanitari” \(humanitarian corridors\) \. They will be hosted by a network of houses and receiving centres located not only in Italy \(Lazio, Tuscany, Piedmont, Liguria, Campania, Puglia\), but also in San Marino republic\. It’s the fourth group that, from February 2016, has been able to reach Italy safely and legally, thanks to the agreement between the Italian government, the community of Sant’Egidio, the Federation of the Evangelic Churches and Tavola Valdese\. The total amount of people helped through this project are 281\. Around one thousand are expected to come, also from Libano, Morocco and [Ethiopia](http://www.ansa.it/lazio/notizie/2016/06/16/migranti-altri-81-profughi-a-fiumicino_b2eb2a10-47f5-4b1b-8e0d-c50cbf7988e3.html) \._

### Developments about the situation of refugees and refugee aid in Ventimiglia


> _The debate around the situation in Ventimiglia goes on, while the new temporary centre for migrants is being set up in Park Roja, close to Bevera, north of the town\. Workers’ unions have written a letter to prefect Silvana Tizzano, to the health local unit and to the municipalities of Ventimiglia, Vallecrosia, Camporosso and Bordighera: they ask an official meeting; meanwhile, bishop Antonio Suetta, ensures the availability of a fully equipped structure \(ex hospital Carità in Taggia\) to host migrant women and children\. Senator Buemi is acting at the policy level, proposing an amendment to support financially all the municipalities which are spending a lot for the assistance to migrant minors\. Like Ventimiglia, a town that spent 220,000 euro on this [need](http://www.lastampa.it/2016/06/16/edizioni/imperia/migranti-prosegue-lemergenza-a-ventimiglia-sNMPJ2TIgPyQX7CTVbPMWJ/pagina.html) \._

### Two smugglers arrested in Pozzallo


> _Two migrant smugglers have been arrested in Pozzallo, accused of having led a dinghy with 140 migrants on board last night\. The migrants have been rescued by the supply vessel “Bourbon Argos”\. The smugglers, a Malian and a Senegalese, are under arrest for illegal delivery of migrants, and for inhuman and humiliating treatment while holding them\. Migrants are now hosted at Pozzallo’s hotspot to be visited, identified and transferred to other centers; 38 of them are women \(some are pregnant\), and 38 are minors\. Each passenger paid 800 dollars and have been residing for a long time within abandoned barns, waiting for good weather [conditions](http://ragusa.gds.it/2016/06/17/migranti-sbarcati-a-pozzallo-arrestati-due-presunti-scafisti-video_527351/) \._ 




### _Transfer of refugees from_ Greece to Rome


> _Following the visit of the Pope to the Island of Lesvos, in Greece, when he accompanied three families of refugees back to Rome, a second group of nine refugees has arrived in Rome yesterday, June 16th, [2016](http://media.gov.gr/index.php/%CF%85%CF%80%CE%B7%CF%81%CE%B5%CF%83%CE%B9%CE%B5%CF%83/%CF%80%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%86%CF%85%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C-%CE%B6%CE%AE%CF%84%CE%B7%CE%BC%CE%B1/transfer-of-refugees-from-greece-to-rome) \._ 




### Foreign Entrepreneur chosen to be the Best Entrepreneur of the Year


> _Madi Sakande is a foreign entrepreneur in Italy who has been awarded with prize Moneygram, as best entrepreneur of the year\. His motto is “take cold to Africa”: in 2011 he and other mates took over a historical Italian firm in the field of refrigeration, now New Cold System, which plans and realizes refrigerating systems for food and pharmaceutical firms\. His last project, launched in short time, foresees the food conservation with solar\-panel\-charged systems, so that “70% of what is produced in Sub\-Saharan Africa won’t be wasted any longer”, as Sakande explained\._ 





> _According to president of the house of deputies Laura Boldrini, who delivered the prize, people like him support the Italian demography, the income, and they should receive the Italian citizenship, since they truly belong to the Italian social fabric\. In Italy, 350,000 firms belong to foreigners, who contribute for 9% of the national GDP\. President of the instate for pensions Tito Boeri added that migrants deposit 8 billion euros into the national social safety funds every year, and they withdraw only 3 of them; some of them came back to their country, thus not receiving the money they deposited [back](http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/notizie/2016-06-16/migranti-miglior-imprenditore-e-manager-burkina-faso-203940.shtml?uuid=ADJ92Ud) \._

> _Austrian state radio Ö1 reported in today’s Morgenjournal about plans of the Department of the Interior, to have the controversial ordinance enacted by Parliament in order to enforce the upper limits\._ 





> _What kind of light does this shed on the practices by the registration authority in Spielfeld between February and March of 2016 where in the space of only 24 days more than 580 Syrians, Iraqis and Afghans were randomly sorted out by Austrian officials and sent back to Slovenia?_ 





> _The Styrian Administrative Court is currently also preoccupied with this question\. More than 20 cases are currently pending here where such rejections are disputed and those affected are asserting their right to an asylum hearing in [Austria](http://oe1.orf.at/artikel/442627) \._

### British Syrian Community Mourning British MP Jo Cox: “She fought on our side”


> Yasmine Nahlawi from Rethink Rebuild at the vigil for Jo Cox in Manchester Piccadilly, “We are a community that has become used to loss, whether that be our homes, country, and loved ones but Jo’s death has opened wounds\.
