### Turkey

The situation in Turkey, a country that the EU considers safe enough to make a deal with, is becoming more and more dangerous for refugees and migrants, as well as for its own citizens\. However, the International Crisis Group, and think\-tank, issued a report titled “ [Turkey’s Syrian Refugees: Defusing Metropolitan Tensions](https://d2071andvip0wj.cloudfront.net/248-turkey-s-syrian-refugees.pdf) ,” claiming that there is huge potential for anti\-refugee violence in Turkey’s three biggest cities, which host over a fifth of Syrians in the country\.

According to the ICG findings, incidents of inter\-communal strife trebled in the second half of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016\.

“While the ICG recorded 35 deaths last year, the victims mostly Syrians, the number of violent incidents is likely much higher,” the ICG claims\.


> “The majority of Syrian refugees do not speak Turkish\. Though a recent study cited by the ICG showed that 72% of Syrians feel “close” or “very close” to Turkish society, the feeling isn’t mutual\. Of the Turks polled, more than half said they felt “far” or “very far” from Syrians… A survey published in December 2017 found that 75% of Turkish citizens did not believe they could co\-habit harmoniously with Syrians\.” 





The government do nothing to prevent hostilities\. Even more, their military engagement in Syria, among other goals, aims to stop refugees from coming\.

Welcome to Europe’s [guide book](http://w2eu.info/turkey.ar/articles/turkey-interceptions-or-readmissiondeportation-to-turkey-mylumat-yn-ma-gb-alqam-bx-fi-xhal-aytradat-u-trdtrxhl.html) with information on what to do in case of interceptions or readmissions/deportations to Turkey is now available in Arabic too\.
### Italy

Starting from February 1st, Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, will engage in a new operation in the Central Mediterranean assisting Italy in border control activities\. The new operation, as Frontex team stated in their [press release](http://frontex.europa.eu/pressroom/news/frontex-launching-new-operation-in-central-med-25ZiLR) , will have “an enhanced law enforcement focus” and will cover the route in the Central Mediterranean used by people coming from Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Turkey and Albania\.

Raher than saving lives, this operation aims at “collection of intelligence and other steps aimed at detecting foreign fighters and other terrorist threats at the external borders”\.

Additionally, as in Greece, in Italy Frontex is present at hot spots in order to, officially, “assist the national authorities in registering migrants, including taking their fingerprints and confirming their nationalities”\.

Volunteers from [Care4Calais](https://www.facebook.com/care4calais/posts/1807764922589790) group followed a group of refugees on a desperate journey over the snowy Italian Alps where many try to cross the high mountains into France\.

People started using this route last year when the French/Italian border controls were tightened up\. However, during the winter things have become more serious\.

> “The mountains are now covered in thick snow and temperatures drop to between \-10 to \-20 at night; but night time is when people have the best chance of avoiding police detection\. A local lady explained to me her fears for people walking over large areas of the mountain that are frozen solid and slippery, with no marked paths and no one to find you if you fall down injured\. There are signs that the local villagers have put up on the walls, translated into Arabic, Pashto, and three other languages\. These read ‘Danger of death … please do not try’ and ‘Please STOP… some people already died’\.” 





Most of the people who are on this route do not have proper clothes or shoes\. Some even lost their feet while trying to cross due to frostbite\.

There are many volunteers in this area trying to do their best to help people who are forced to take this perilous journey due to the ridiculous EU policy of closed borders\. If you can help to buy a pair of waterproof walking boots or a coat for a refugee go to [https://goo\.gl/jmkx7A](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgoo.gl%2Fjmkx7A&h=ATNA7b2EpzfhkhRZgQl5Ez6tLoFZZqqGFzYMAWkXUdCEU_SNOIOVf5EtHW0uSXJwKwo7crHkzqdnxhbocTm66iv0FSoAUwpxujecxbDu4wDXLvJbbPMehDNbExgoxl9wWMwu4IJ5yZJX8lv-LydKlttS1iJ-1JsShDCGvJXQncgStmjzhxqhUlKsA3HfU67YSSw8IBB32lsjT-9-UCeSWtQAgMnmNpgcvG6n6KEtrp9999CNj-OF9_H6tskvQcFH)

**Northern Greece**

Local and International media have gathered various testimonies clearly showing illegal pushbacks from the Evros area of northern Greece, which borders Turkey\. Yet, they [report,](http://m.tvxs.gr/mo/i/251617/f/news/ellada/biaies-epanaproothiseis-ginontai-thema-einai-me-poianoy-entoli.html) the Minister of Citizen Protection has strongly denied that this is possible even though it is reported to be the Greek police who carry out these illegal actions\.

Urgent need for doctors

### Croatia

After yesterday’s suicide attempt by Eritrean asylum seeker in Zagreb reception center Porin, another person, from Bangladesh, tried to commit suicide today by drinking excessive amount of alcohol\-vinegar\. Allegedly, the person was desperate because of the negative asylum decision that he received today\.

This is a second suicide attempt related to asylum process in two days in Zagreb\.
### Hungary

**Civil society organisations appeal against Hungarian government** Fourteen Hungarian civil society organisations have submitted a joint appeal to the European Court of Human Rights, asking the court to declare that the new law on “foreign funding” violates the groups’ fundamental rights, Liberties [report](https://www.liberties.eu/en/news/fourteen-hungarian-ngos-have-brought-an-action-before-the-ecthr/14186) \.

The same organisations had previously lodged a complaint with the Hungarian Constitutional Court concerning the stigmatising act\. However, the Constitutional Court has failed to place the case on its agenda during the last five months\. The complaint was signed by 23 NGOs and submitted to the Constitutional Court in last June\.

Given that there is no binding deadline for the court to complete inquiries and the concerned NGOs continue to be affected by the law, in the absence of other legal remedies, 14 NGOs brought an action before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg in December\.

In their appeal, NGOs claim that the act on “organisations funded from abroad” violates the rights to freedom of association and to freedom of expression as well as the right to respect for private and family life\. Furthermore, they say that the act unnecessarily and disproportionately discriminates between NGOs using only national funds and those funded from abroad, discouraging potential donors and inhibiting cooperation with concerned NGOs\.
### **Poland**

**Unfair detention of Tajiki family**

A new case of unfair detention of asylum seekers in Poland has arrived to the European Court of Human Rights\.

As the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights in Poland \(HFHR\) [report](http://www.hfhr.pl/fundacja/) , the case concerns a family from Tajikistan \(parents with two small children\), who repeatedly tried to submit an application for international protection in Medyka, on the Polish/Ukranian border, due to persecution in their country of origin, however, they were prevented by Border Guard officers\. Finally, the application was accepted in October 2016, after several attempts to cross the border\. Then the whole family was placed in the Guarded Centre for Foreigners in Przemyśl\.

During their stay, psychiatric disorders were dignosed, related to both violence experienced in Tajikistan and the prolonged detention in Poland\. The detention also had a negative impact on the condition of children\. Nevertheless, neither the Border Guard nor the courts took into account the medical documentation presented by them\. There was also no appointment of an expert who would assess the impact of detention on the woman’s health, who attempted suicide after 10 months\. Despite this, the Border Guard extended their detention even further and started the process for expulsion and repatriation\.

Only in July 2017 the District Court in Przemyśl decided not to release them, while still waiting for a decision about their expulsion\.

You can read the appeal lodged at the ECHR [here](https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#%7B%22itemid%22:[%22001-180603%22]%7D) \.
### Germany

Media [report](http://www.novinite.com/articles/187504/Bulgarian+Citizen+Arrested+in+Germany+for+Human+Trafficking) that a Bulgarian man and a Turkish man have been arrested for people trafficking\. They are thought to be involved in a larger trafficking ring that operates along the Balkan route\.

[Taranis News](https://www.facebook.com/taranisnews/posts/2017090388504472?hc_location=ufi) report that while there have been two evictions of refugee camps in two days — Villette and du Wharf, the occupation of the university has survived to a second night\.


> A lot of students on the spot, an organization already in place\. Dozens of on the scene\. The Presidency of the university does not object to the end of the control of student cards at the entrance\.

### UK

**British _damaging_ family reunification policies** 
A new research, [Safe but not settled](https://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/assets/0004/2515/Safe_but_not_settled.pdf) , carried out by the Refugee Council and Oxfam, is one of the first to look at how family reunion and ongoing forced separation from loved ones affect the ability of refugees to successfully integrate into UK society\.

Eleven of the 44 families interviewed have now been reunited in the UK with some of the loved ones they left behind\. For 9 out of the 11, integration into British society was quicker and easier as a result\.

As the Independent newspaper [reports](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/refugees-suicidal-immigration-policies-family-reunification-refugee-council-oxfam-a8185371.html?utm_content=bufferd96e6&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer) , those who can’t be reunited with their families are left “desperate — and in some cases suicidal — due to government immigration laws”, as they develop mental health problems as a result of being separated from their relatives because of the Home Office’s “damaging” reunification policies\.


> Many are “plagued” by worry, making it difficult for them to successfully integrate into British life as they struggle to focus on finding work, making friends and learning English\. In some cases they are said to be so anxious they rarely leave their homes\.
 

> The UK currently only allows adult refugees to apply for their spouses and dependent children under 18 to join them\. This means their grandparents, parents, siblings and children above the age of 17 are prevented from coming to Britain to join them in starting a new life\. Additionally, legal aid has not been available for refugee family reunion since 2013, making it even more difficult for families separated by war and persecution to reunite\.
