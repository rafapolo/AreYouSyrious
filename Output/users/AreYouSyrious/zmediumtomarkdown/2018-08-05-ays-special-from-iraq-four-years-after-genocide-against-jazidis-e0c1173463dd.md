Bajed Kandala is a camp in the North\-West of the Kurdistan Region, in Iraq, where desplaced Yazidi people have been living for four years now, or since ISIS committed genocide against them in Sinjar, north\-west of Iraq\. Exactly four years ago Yazidis from this region went to sleep one night only to be woken by guns and horrors that they have been living through until today\. Noobody was prepared for the night that would change everything and everybody\.

Peshmerga units, that had been in Sinjar to protect people, decided to leave before the fighting stared\. What people are talking about until today is that the soldiers left during the night, without advising the population to do the same\.

Sinjar was the area where Yazidis and Sunni Muslims had been living alongside each other for a long time\. But that day, many Sunnis took the side of ISIS and participated in the attack on their neighbors\.

Around 4,000 people from this area were killed in the following days\. Some maneged to escape, but until today they cannot go back to their homes\. Not even to mark the anniversary of their genocide\.

In 2014, Yazidis fled to Mount Sinjar, where another uncounted number of people died of hunger, thirst or exhaustion: there, they were surrounded\. They were saved by the Syrian Kurdish forces who opened a safe corridor for Yazidis\.

As a result of these military actions, until today around 3,000 people are considered missing\. During the attack, some 7,000 women were abducted and forced to sexual slavery\.

The events of 2014 are a grave reminder of the genocide committed in Srebrenica, Bosnia, in 1995\. In both cases, the UN and the wider international community did little to nothing to prevent the genocides, or later to help to survivors\.

After the genocide in Sinjar, the Iraqi government, together with some international organizations, have created several camps for displaced Yazidis\. There were created as transitory camps but became permanent ones as no other solution was given\. Bajed Kandala Camp is just an example\.

The camp has a population of about 11,000 Yezidis\. As in most refugee camps, density is something beyond imagination\. UNHCR tents from which the camp is made, are created to last for maximum one year\. People are living in the surrounding where, due to the heat and the high temperatures, fires occur often\. Because the tents are also situated very close to each other, there is a high probability of fires spreading quickly\.

Here, the school doesn’t have enough teachers and so students have lessons only three days a week\.

Today I was working with J\., a 17\-year\-old guy\. When I asked him to bring me to a place that makes him happy, he drove me in front of the closed school without a second thought\.

Which kind of future are we guaranteeing for them?

At the moment, Yazidis feel like they are the group abandoned by everybody and left to take care of themselves, without basic rights and any hope for the future\.

For their Memorial Day, Yazidis from Bajed Kandala Camp asked permission to come back to Sinjar\. To return to their land, closer to their homes just for one day\. It has been denied\. Sinjar is still full of mines and has been declared unsafe\.

“Everyone wants to go out from Iraq\. There is no future here for us,” is the message they sent to the world\.
