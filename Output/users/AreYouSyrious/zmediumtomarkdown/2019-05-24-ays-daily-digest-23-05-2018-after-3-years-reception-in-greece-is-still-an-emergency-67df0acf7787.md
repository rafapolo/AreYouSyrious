#### Feature: After 3 years, reception in Greece is still an emergency

[Refugee Support Aegean \(RSA\) researchers conducted interviews with individual refugees and families living in five refugee camps in Northern and Central Greece \(Central Macedonia, Epirus and Thessaly\)](https://rsaegean.org/en/reception-crisis-in-northern-greece-three-years-of-emergency-solutions/#2-4_vulnerable) \.


> Three years after the implementation of the EU\-Turkey ‘Deal’ and despite the reality of ongoing arrivals of refugees, the Greek government has not been able so far to create a functioning reception system\. Short\-term emergency solutions are being implemented until today\. Any increase of arrivals is viewed as “unexpected\.” 




RSA state that “the Greek government never managed to move on from an emergency reception approach” to long\-term solutions or even just mid\-term ones\. As a consequence of the practice of using data and forecasts for electoral campaigning, “the numbers of refugees in need of shelter exceed those anticipated by Greek authorities for a third year in row\. As a result, refugee camps in the mainland became once more overcrowded while substandard reception conditions have a detrimental impact upon the physical and mental health of their residents”\.

> Camps that have ceased to operate in 2017 because of conditions re\-opened their gates in spring 2018\. Tents are being set up in the camps and then dismantled depending on the needs, and hotels are rented as short\-term shelters during the winter without seemingly any plan for what comes next\. Until today only three out of the 28 camps operating in the mainland have the required legal basis\. 





The lack of prospects and independence, the substandard conditions, and the risk of eviction and unequal opportunities have fueled fights and protests, underlining the, “need for a functioning reception system for recognized refugees and asylum\-seekers with the objective of finding dignified long\-term solutions that will allow also their integration in local societies\.”

Many of the people interviewed by RSA spoke of feelings of abandonment, giving a bleak picture of their life in the camps\.

> They spoke of overcrowding and unequal housing options resulting in tensions among the refugee population in the camps and frequent fights\. They described how the remoteness of the camps and the decrease in services and gradual withdrawal of the UNHCR and NGOs had worsened their situation\. They reported increasing difficulties in accessing primary health care after the take\-over of health care services in camps by the National Organization for Public Health \(EODY\) \. Protests linked to conditions have frequently taken place particularly in [Diavata](https://rsaegean.org/en/reception-crisis-in-northern-greece-three-years-of-emergency-solutions/#post-5180-endnote-17) , [Filippiada](https://rsaegean.org/en/reception-crisis-in-northern-greece-three-years-of-emergency-solutions/#post-5180-endnote-18) and [Koutsochero](https://rsaegean.org/en/reception-crisis-in-northern-greece-three-years-of-emergency-solutions/#post-5180-endnote-19) camps\.

GREECE
#### ARRIVALS

Arrivals on the Greek islands have not made the headlines for a long while, but the lack of attention by mainstream media does not mean that people have stopped trying to cross the Aegean Sea or that numbers are decreasing\.

ITALY
#### People on the Vos Thalassa found not guilty

Local media [report](http://www.alqamah.it/2019/05/23/assolti-i-presunti-rivoltosi/) that the court of Trapani, in Sicily, have ruled not to proceed against the two asylum seekers that had been charged for provoking a “revolt” on the Vos Thalassa in August 2018\.

The ruling refers to the Vos Thalassa/Diciotti case\. In the summer 2018 Italian minister Salvini, Italian media and police had loudly pointed at the two people as provokers and authors of a “revolt” on board of the Vos Thalassa vessel, after having being rescued and threatened to be returned to Libya\. The people were later transferred on the Diciotti boat that was held for days in the Sicilian port\. For this same case, Salvini was under investigation, but Italian Parliament voted to grant him immunity\.

FRANCE
#### Facebook censor police violence exposure

UK
#### Open letter to British PM to speed up and increase the transfer of children from Northern France

11 humanitarian organizations working in Calais and Northern France, both Franch and British, have written [an open letter to Theresa May](http://safepassage.org.uk/resource/an-open-letter-to-the-prime-minister/) , setting her a deadline to fill the current Dubs quota of 480 places for unaccompanied children and urging her to, “enable children subject to acutely vulnerable circumstances to swiftly reach safety,” in the UK, by increasing the total number of places available\.
#### RefuAID & SLC partner to provide English Language certificates for refugee doctors

[RefuAid](https://refuaid.org/) and the [Specialist Language Courses](https://blog.specialistlanguagecourses.com/blog/) have partnered to provide English language certificates for refugee doctors in the UK who are ready to be employed in the NHS\. RefuAid works with hundreds of refugees and asylum seekers to give them the language skills and the professional training they need to enter the labour market\. They mentor a number of doctors who are ready to work but need the IELTS or OET English language qualification to register with the GMC\. These are high level, high stakes tests and require specialist training to pass with the grades specified\.
