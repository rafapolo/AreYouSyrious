### Riot in Moria

Another fight broke out in the hotspot of Moria, Lesvos, among the camp residents on Monday, [Lesvosnet](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1652972374920129/permalink/1983598251857538/) and independent volunteers confirmed\. The riot resulted in the destruction of the camp’s medical centre near the northern gate of the area, when some entered it to protect themselves and others attacked them\.

It should be noted that the situation due to the increasing flows in the camp is explosive since in it there are about 6,300 residents in an infrastructure for 3,000 people\.

Lesvos Solidarity [raises awareness](https://www.facebook.com/pikpalesvos/posts/2066728616935892) , that in ten days, on 20th April, the trial of the so called Moria 35 will start\. “On 18 July 2017, 35 people were arbitrarily arrested during a violent police raid in the “African Section” of Moria camp after a peaceful protest”, the volunteers remember\. Still, the policed crashed it using tear gas and arrested 35 people, who were not involved in the following clashed\. They highlight: “There seems to be no individual evidence against them\. They now risk up to 10 years in prison and could be excluded from the right to international protection\. There is evidence of police violence during the arrests, and in the police station\.”

Four of the defendants receive assistance from Lesvos Solidarity, including the payment of lawyers and court fees\. To support them, you can donate on this [fundraiser](https://lesvossolidarity.org/en/donate-en/financial-donations) \. There are also several possibilities to show solidarity by taking action\.

Dental health care is a tough topic, especially in dire conditions like in Moria or other hotspots\. No wonder, that the Health\-Point Foundation experiences busy days at the moment\.

But luckily, there is not only pain, frustration and discrimination on the islands — mostly thanks to volunteer efforts\. The Flying Seagull Project [came](https://www.facebook.com/samosvolunteers/posts/958527444325416) a second time to Samos to entertain the children and draw some smiles in their faces\.

Volunteers of the [Refugees Foundation Serbia](https://www.facebook.com/izbegliceusrbiji/posts/2125423214135311) used the last day of the spring holydays, to hike in the mountains with residents of a camp close to Belgrade: “For one day they were able to forget their worries, and that they live in the camp for far too long now\. Spending day in nature, hiking, volleyball, card games, and eating on the grass field brought smiles to the faces of our friends and warmth to our heart\.”

L’Auberge des Migrants faces logistic problems as two of their vans broke and another already had collapsed\. To buy a new van for their distributions, transfers and logistic operations, they are now calling for 15,000 Euro\.

### The Netherlands
#### Bad conditions for children with illnesses or disabilities in AZC’s \(asylum seeker centres\)

Asylum seekers’ children with serious illnesses or disabilities are seriously affected by the living conditions in asylum seekers’ centres according to health professionals, doctors and trusted persons/counsellors\.

RTL Nieuws [has researched](https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nederland/slechte-omstandigheden-in-azc-voor-kinderen-met-ziekte-of-handicap) two harrowing cases in Amersfoort: One about 6 year old Zuzu suffering from down syndrome and 15 year old Qiyas suffering from epilepsy\. Both boys live in AZC’s which are not appropiate to treat their conditions\. According to Defense for Children, these are not incidents because dozens of sick and disabled children are living in these conditions in AZC’s\. The organization has seen an increase of similar cases from 40 in 2016 to 57 in 2017 and has started an investigation\.

However the AZC in Amersfoort is not the only place where sick and disabled asylum seekers children have to live in inadequate conditions, it happens everywhere in the Netherlands\. The situation sometimes gets so bad, that children are transferred to the hospital immediately\.
### Denmark

New deportations took also place from Denmark, activistis demonstrated at the airport to prevent it\. So far, there are no further information available\. We will give updates, as soon as we have access to\. If you have them, please get in touch with us\.
