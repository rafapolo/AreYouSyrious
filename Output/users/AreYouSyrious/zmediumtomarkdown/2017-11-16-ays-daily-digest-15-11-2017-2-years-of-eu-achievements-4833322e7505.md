**Feature: 2 Years of EU “achievements”**

A week after two dead children washed up on the beaches of Lesvos, the European Commission has published a [press release](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-4484_en.htm) listing its perceived achievements in the last two years\. This is part of the run\-up to the European Council in December, one of the main bodies involved in negotiating between EU and non\-EU countries and international organisations\.

They state that ‘irregular crossings’ into Europe have dropped by 63% in 2017 due to “ _collective efforts to protect the EU’s external borders, cooperate with partner countries to tackle the root causes of irregular migration, improve the protection of migrants and win the fight against smugglers\.”_

From the ground we can tell you what this looks like — Turkish and Libyan Coastguards firing on refugee boats, the rape, torture and slavery of people seeking sanctuary trapped in Libya, the death of children from cold weather on Greek islands, the [false imprisonment of a Dutch journalist](http://harekact.bordermonitoring.eu/2017/11/15/greece-releases-dutch-reporter-taken-for-smuggler/) accused of people smuggling by Greek police, even though he had ID and Press Cards, because he had brown skin\.

First Vice\-President Frans Timmermans is said to have stated that: _“Since 2015, we have made real progress through our joint work to manage migration better in a comprehensive way\.”_

A large part of Timmermans job is ensuring that the [EU Charter of Fundamental Rights](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/fundamental-rights/charter/index_en.htm) is adhered to\. The Charter describes the EU as a haven for Human Rights:


> Conscious of its spiritual and moral heritage, the Union is founded on the indivisible, universal values of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity; it is based on the principles of democracy and the rule of law\. It places the individual at the heart of its activities, by establishing the citizenship of the Union and by creating an area of freedom, security and justice\. 





Under the heading ‘Addressing Root Causes and Saving Lives’ the report states that as part of the €3 billion deal to support refugees in Turkey “ _one million of the most vulnerable Syrian refugees now receive monthly electronic cash transfers\.”_ Yet it is well documented that of the approximately 3\.5 million refugees in Turkey many are forced into low paid labour including [children as young as 7 exploited in garment factories](https://business-humanrights.org/en/an-estimated-250000-syrian-refugees-working-in-turkey-vulnerable-to-exploitation) \. They continue to say that “ _the EU Trust Fund for Africa is increasing stability and resilience by supporting economic development and migration management in countries facing crises of different natures and emergency situations\.”_ While [local media reports](https://www.africanindy.com/news/dozens-of-tortured-bodies-discovered-in-libya-11993286) that 28 bodies showing signs of torture have been discovered in a mass grave in Libya due to the ongoing civil war\.

The situation in Libya for refugees was condemned yesterday by UN monitors who visited detention facilities and said they found _“ [thousands of emaciated and traumatized men, women and children piled on top of each other”\.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-41983063)_

While the EU commission states that _“medical help and assistance is being delivered to migrants, including in detention centres,”_ the UN calls their support of Libya in returning people to detention ‘Inhuman\.’

The report clearly states that more returns and deportations must take place\.


> With return rates at EU level remaining unsatisfactory, this is an area which requires the commitment of all to ensure concrete progress is made\. \[…\] The EU should also continue collectively exploring the mobilisation of all incentives and leverages to achieve progress on return, as endorsed by the European Council\. 





Even though there have been countless situations were this has endangered lives, such as the [return of Afghan asylum seekers from Denmark](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/afghanistan-police-beat-asylum-seekers-danish-officers-deportation-flight-kabul-refugee-returns-safe-a7739176.html) who were then beaten by police in the airport\.

#### **Right to Work and Right to Travel: Rumors and Facts**

The [Athens Volunteers Information and Co\-ordination Group](https://web.facebook.com/groups/AthensVolunteersInformation/?ref=group_header) have collected information on recent rumours spreading across the local refugee community\.

**Refugees who have asylum in Europe CAN ONLY WORK IN THEIR HOST COUNTRY**

Over the last weeks, there have been rumours that refugees can work in countries other than the one that they have been given asylum protection in\. In particular, the rumours suggest that people can travel on their 90 day travel documents and work in either Germany or the UK\. This rumour is not true\. Refugees who have asylum in Europe can only work in their host country, nowhere else\. The timing of such rights in the host country can differ depending on the laws of each country\. Refugees who have been given asylum in one country do not have the same rights to work in other EU countries as EU citizens\.

Non EU citizens need to apply for a Working Schengen Visa and get a residence permit before entering the Schengen territories for work purposes\. Only citizens of USA, Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland, as well as EU citizens can apply for their residence permit after entering the Schengen territory without a visa\.

Read more: [https://www\.schengenvisainfo\.com/working\-schengen\-visa/](https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/working-schengen-visa/)

If anyone is suggesting that it is possible to work in countries \(which are not the host country\) then this is incorrect and most likely it is illegal\. Please note that these are common rumours that traffickers and smugglers use when they intend to use refugees for prostitution or slave trades\. Therefore single women/girls and young men/boys need to be extra vigilant\.

**Refugees rights to move in EU countries \(apart from the 90 days travel\)**

People granted refugee status in an EU country can get the right to move to most other EU countries if they’ve been living here “legally and continuously” for five years\. But there are exceptions: the UK has chosen not to be covered by this law\. So refugees in an EU country like Germany would need to become citizens of that country in order to benefit from free movement rights and travel to the UK\.

The length of time to acquire citizenship varies across the EU\. For example, refugees are entitled to citizenship after eight years in Germany\. Refugees can apply for citizenship after five years in Italy and four years in Sweden, according to the European Union Democracy Observatory, but the outcome of the application depends on income and other factors and it is at the discretion of governments\.

#### Authorities launch strike on Lesvos

Yesterday Spyros Galinos, mayor of Lesvos, launched a general strike for next Monday as an act of protest against the lack of action of central government regarding the overcrowding of the islands, media [report](http://www.ekathimerini.com/223273/article/ekathimerini/news/lesvos-reaches-breaking-point-mayor-declares-general-strike) \.

With a total local population of 32,000 people, there are at the moment around 8,300 refugees on the island\. 6,000 are living in or around the detention centre in Moria, which is geared for 2,000 people, and has around 1,500 people living in unheated tents or sleeping rough\.

Around one hundred refugees started to gather in Aristotelus square, Thessaloniki this morning\. Responding to a call diffused over the last few days on social media, they are demonstrating against the deadlock situation they are in: continuous delays in the reunification program, unwillingness of many European countries to welcome more refugees, impossibility to leave the country, malfunctions in the Greek reception system\. Some tents have been set up and, according to [media sources](http://parallaximag.gr/thessaloniki/symvainei-tora-stin-plateia-aristotelous) , one of the participants threatened to self\-immolate with petrol\.
From many different nationalities, refugees arrived from Athens, Lamia, Lesvos, Chios, as well as from the camps in the north of the country\.

The majority of them are young men, but there are also women and children\. The aim of the demonstration is to reach the northern border on foot\.

_“Even though the so called Balkan Corridor is closed, they are committed to reach Northern and Central Europe, where their relatives live\.”_

At around 19\.30 the group started the march, but the police blocked the road to the border before the city’s train station\. Demonstrators occupied the street for some time, confronting the police\.
#### Journalist Sakir Khader released in Greece

According to [media sources](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/dutch-journalist-sakir-khader-detained-greece-171114103715340.html) , Dutch journalist Sakir Khader was detained on Monday at the Greek\-Turkish border while reporting on refugees crossing into Greece via Turkey\.

The reporter had joined a group of about 50 Syrians as they crossed a small river that demarcates the border between Greece and Turkey near the town of Didymoteicho\.


> I have been detained for 30 hours and treated badly, I was not allowed to make calls and kept on getting ISIL\-related questions, I was on my way with a group of refugees to Athens to see how refugees are now entering Europe, we were met by police at the border and I was mistaken for a smuggler, even though I showed them my press cards\. 





He was handed a suspended five\-month prison sentence on Tuesday for entering a restricting military area without permission\.
#### Volunteering opportunities and call for donations

#### **Cona refugees marching towards Venice**

Yesterday a group of 300 refugees left the reception centre in the ex\-military base of Cona with the intention of walking to Venice and meet the prefect\. Last night they slept in Codevigo, on buses\.


> They don’t want to return to Cona, because the conditions are not liveable\. The ex\-base is unfit to host people; basic services and paths for inclusions are not guaranteed\. 






> We want immediate solution, we denounced the bad conditions in Cona months ago, no one listened\.

From [Melting Pot Europa](https://web.facebook.com/meltingpoteuropa/) ’s [account of today](http://www.meltingpot.org/Cona-Ve-Richiedenti-asilo-protestano-e-lasciano-il-centro.html) :
- 12\.00: The prefect arrives in Codevigo and meets the refugees\.


At the same time, in Cona, the centre was occupied by the refugees who stayed there\. Workers are outside\.

> “We want to close this concentration camp” 



- 13\.50: The meeting finishes\.


The prefect and the head of local police said that they don’t have _technical solutions_ to relocate the refugees\. They instead proposed to go back to the Cona centre and meet again in 5 days\. The group of refugees refused to go back and decided to stay in Codevigo\.


> “We are ready to camp here until humane solutions will be found”\. 



- 14\.40: The centre in Cona is still occupied\. They invite the prefect inside to see first\-hand the horrible conditions\. Three demands are made:


1\. To close the centre in Cona;

2\. To find alternative accommodation for all the refugees of Cona, providing social inclusion projects and guaranteeing basic services;

3\. To know how their friends in Codevigo are and what will happen to them\.
- 16\.50: The group of asylum seekers in Codevigo are marching towards the town centre\. They intend to ask for the church to open to host them for the night\.
- 17\.05: Those who were occupying Cona centre decide to leave and reach the other group in Codevigo\.

- 22\.30: The church stays closed and the mayor decides not to intervene\. A double shame\. Asylum seekers are sleeping outside the church\.

Tomorrow they want to reach Venice and the Prefect office, together with the activists that are arriving from the surroundings\.

As an absurd epilogue, an asylum seeker that was trying to reach the group in Codevigo on his bike was run over and died in the evening\. Even after this news the church was not opened …
