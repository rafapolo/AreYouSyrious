After Serbian authorities failed in trying to convince refugees currently sleeping rough in **Belgrade** and in the **north** , near the Hungarian border, to **voluntarily move** to organized official sites, they decided to forcefully evict the refugees\.

This morning before the sunrise, there was a fast and secretely organized police action by which 109 refugees squatting in Belgrade were taken on buses and sent to Presevo\. This happened between 4 and 6 a\.m\. According to reports more than 300 police in riot gear, Gendarme, and anti\-terrorism officials, wearing helmets and shields, surrounded the buildings behind the main bus station where over 700 refugees live in empty warehouses\. Police forced people to get on buses with lies and threats\. Preševo, where refugees were taken to, is from where constantly people get pushed back and, moreover, contacts in Macedonia report semi\-regular pushbacks with people being dropped at the border\. These are all yet another indication of cleansings of refugees that are taking place in Serbia\.

Many refugees tried to hide, fearing being put in closed camps or being deported to Macedonia and Bulgaria\. In such circumstances, one man fell from a roof and broke his leg\. There are reports of many other various injuries\. Refugees fear being pushed back, which is more than a legit concern seeing the Serbian state intentions\.

Along these lines, Serbian authorities requested humanitarian organizations to stop distributing food and aid to migrants and refugees in the center of Belgrade\. Herewith, the state is making it unbearable for refugees to stay\. Even Are You Syrious? is now re\-considering its mobile kitchen plans, as cooking for refugees in Serbia would mean breaking the law and facing severe fines\. Seeing the overwhelming hunger and the lack of food provided by the Serbian state, this is heartbreaking\.
### Numbers
- Kelebija 100

8 people were killed, and tens of people were injured by 14 airstrikes on civilians neighborhoods in Douma city\. The people were hit by Assad and Russian warplanes’ bombs\.

Here is a message from a person living inside the targeted areas:


> The neighborhood that I live in has been attacked very hard by the warplanes that caused large destruction and lots of suffering of us here\. Our neighbors lost their 6 year old child, and 2 other children were killed here\. We were searching for victims under debris and fixing our home for the whole day\. 




### UN says 250,000 Aleppo residents could starve if emergency resupply fails

Residents in Aleppo’s eastern rebel\-held region are being handed out the last remaining food rations, the UN says\. The organization’s aid convoys have been unable to access the area since July\.
### UN Presents Plan for Saving Syrian Aleppo

The United Nations are proposing a plan consisting of four parts for saving Syrian city of Aleppo, Senior Adviser to UN Special Envoy for Syria Jan Egeland said Thursday\.

“We are urging the following four things: medical supplies in to the kneeling medical facilities in east Aleppo; medical evacuations out of east Aleppo for the estimated 300 or so patients that are in urgent need of medical evacuation, together with their families; the third element is food and other urgent supplies, humanitarian relief in to east Aleppo, and the fourth element is more medical personnel in to provide medical relief in east Aleppo\. None of the four elements are conditional on the other\.”

### Tensions on Samos after clashes between residents and refugees

The tension was palpable in the town of Vathi on the island of Samos on Wednesday, in the aftermath of clashes between migrants and local youths late Tuesday\.

Migrants claim that they were attacked by a group of hooded individuals\. However, locals insisted that the stone\-throwing brawl was started by migrants “who circulate and drink in the center of town every night creating trouble\.”

The fighting was broken up by riot police\.

Meanwhile, migrants continued to arrive this week at overcrowded accommodation centers on eastern Aegean islands\.
### Refugees set fire in Chios hotspot to protest their living conditions\. Samos refugees marched for justice\.

For one more time, frustrated refugees and migrants stuck in the hot spots of the islands of Chios and Samos launched protests\.

In the hot spot _Souda_ on Chios, the protest started Wednesday noon when young camp residents having block the street leading to the camp with garbage bins, which they later set on fire\.

Workers left the camp in panic\. The fire spread damaging three mobile units used as clinic, store for medical material and for food distribution\.

In the hot spot of Samos, refugees and migrants marched through the streets at 10 o’clock in the evening demanding dry clothes and tents\.
### Job\-search in Greece made easier

For those migrants and refugees eligible to work in Greece and currently looking for a job, a great number of job adverts are published in English every Thursday on Generation 2\.0 for Rights, Equality & Diversity website\.

### Paris opens its first humanitarian migrant camp

After two and half months of building, the official “humanitarian” Paris migrant camp and reception centre will open its doors on Thursday\.

The new camp is located in a disused hangar, near Porte de la Chapelle, to the north of the city near Gare du Nord\.

It will act as an official reception centre for migrants — mainly single men — who have just arrived in Paris\. Women and children will be taken straight to specific accommodation\.

“The idea is to create a place where every newly arrived migrant can be welcomed and offered dignified, humane shelter,” said Bruno Morel, head of the Emmaus Solidarite charity running the centre\.

The most agree that the camp is good news, but Baam’s post from September 23rd is still relevant: They argue that the 400 beds are insufficient and complain about the temporary nature of the centre\. They also say that people will only be able to stay up to ten days and no team of lawyers is planned to orient and help refugees in their asylum procedures\. After the ten days, asylum\-seekers will be sent to CAOs in the province, from where they could be deported to countries like Hungary and Bulgaria, according to Dublin Regulations\. Baam also says that the French Office for Immigration and Integration \(OFFI\) will be present inside the centre to “accompany” people in their administrative procedures — the group worries that this will transform the centre into a place that sorts between “good” and “bad” migrants\.
#### Spain
### Exhibition

This saturday in Madrid, Spain, there will be a photography exhibit and round table about the situation of refugees in Greece and Europe \(all photos were done in Idomeni and other camps in Greece\) \. The goal of this exhibit is to create awareness of what’s happening here and in other countries\.

Here are the details: Exhibit “Beyond Borders, Más allá de las fronteras”
Saturday, November 12th at 19:00 hrs\.
Centro Cultural Galileo, Calle Galileo 39, Madrid, Spain

Entrance is free\.
#### Germany
### Germany boosts aid to U\.N\. in Africa to deter Europe\-bound migration

Germany on Monday pledged a 61\-million\-euro \($67\.44 million\) hike in funding for U\.N\. relief operations in Africa so that fewer of its people undertake perilous odysseys to Europe, which has struggled to absorb an influx of migrants since last year\.

The extra funding lifts Germany’s total contribution to the U\.N\. refugee agency UNHCR to 298 million euros for 2016, Foreign Ministry officials said\. Its total humanitarian budget for 2016 was 1\.28 billion euros, up from just 105 million euros in 2012\.
