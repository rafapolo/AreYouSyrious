[After three years in prison on Lesvos Akif Rasouli and Amir Zahiri have been acquitted](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid02iGHwpoQZHMyDinBVR8WaNBMu1dUJyjLKRfp1KjjB8GotUpvodZCNiX1xki8MzSCxl&id=537806056) by the appeals court and released\. The two young men from Afghanistan had been sentenced to a total of 100 years in prison\.


> Upon hearing the verdict, his 9\-year\-old daughter broke into tears when she would see her father again\. They spent 3 years in prison without a single witness, not a single piece of evidence linking them to trafficking\. — [_Iasonas Apostolopoulos_](https://www.facebook.com/iasonas.apos?__cft__[0]=AZU6qvPU1ofR4aDRDKyCIRCoXaz1P_UgmcZ8-0iEHQ-DLlYNkm9otBPtAnFx3kPSomyzQbDjwueIU0M09qzvc831lnl4QE5-42ci-gRRODMsoeBMJVeldFj70VUPTZ2KkHaGUICH5TykMbMbw2GZZbDi-x1pu5dcEV0pb5RRX3EjaJUg4_73R0HU6uwdjdftoLI&__tn__=-]C%2CP-R) 





Their trail was postponed for a second time in April 2022, adding a further 8 months to their unjust and unjustifiable sentence\.


> They gave me 30 seconds to speak and put me in prison for 50 years\. I am an Afghan citizen and a refugee\. Why are they doing this to me? It’s unfair\. — [_Amir Zahiri_](https://thepressproject-gr.translate.goog/o-amir-zachiri-kai-o-akif-rasouli-tha-perimenoun-allous-8-mines-adika-sti-fylaki-tous-katadikasan-se-50-chronia-gia-diakinisi-choris-kanenan-martyra-katigorias/?_x_tr_sl=el&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=sc) 





This sentence was handed down after they were accused of trafficking by port guard\. Amir has always been clear that he only drove the boat briefly to save his family’s lives when their trafficker abandoned them in the middle of the sea after the Greek coast guard tried to push them back to Turkey\. In this case, it is only the pushback and the false imprisonment of these men which count as criminal actions\. In both instances it is the Greek state which is in breach of the law\.


> Amir and Akif symbolize thousands of prisoners\. It is a tactic of Greece and Italy to mass imprison random refugees, naming “trafficker” anyone found near the steering wheel of the boat\. 





> Their prosecution is punishable and constitutes criminalization of the very asylum and the right to asylum\. — [_Iasonas Apostolopoulos_](https://www.facebook.com/iasonas.apos?__cft__[0]=AZU6qvPU1ofR4aDRDKyCIRCoXaz1P_UgmcZ8-0iEHQ-DLlYNkm9otBPtAnFx3kPSomyzQbDjwueIU0M09qzvc831lnl4QE5-42ci-gRRODMsoeBMJVeldFj70VUPTZ2KkHaGUICH5TykMbMbw2GZZbDi-x1pu5dcEV0pb5RRX3EjaJUg4_73R0HU6uwdjdftoLI&__tn__=-]C%2CP-R)

Other cases of criminalization are still ongoing\. [On Monday the 5th of December Pieter Wittenberg trial was held in relation to the ERCI case](https://www.facebook.com/HIASGreece/posts/pfbid02wFjVo1Ki72K6HVcxqXWx251KfGbmNVJPJx7W3rCJktajBQYc1GEwMXr6Abd7Ey87l) which has numerous defendants including [Sara Mardini](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/11/17/activists-in-greece-face-charges-for-assisting-incoming-refugees) \. The charges include human smuggling and financial crimes\. The investigation began in 2018 and is still ongoing with the usual absence of evidence, dubious claims and a lack of witnesses\. These cases seem designed to break the spirits of people on the move and those who work alongside them in solidarity and yet people continue to struggle and fight for a fairer world of equality of movement across borders\.

**SAR**
#### Rescue needed in the Atlantic

53 people have now been at sea for 3 nights and can no longer be contacted\. MRCC Rabat has not responded to requests for rescue despite the boats location in their search and rescue zone\. [Delaying rescues in this manner](https://www.msf.org/least-30-people-feared-dead-after-tragic-rescue-central-mediterranean) and [non\-assistance has shown time and time again to cost lives and is illegal under international maritime law](https://www.biicl.org/blog/31/migrant-crossings-in-the-channel-non-assistance-securitisation-and-accountability-under-international-law) \.

#### Evacuations from Geo Barents

[Two women and five children have been evactuated from the Geo Barents](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/45269/two-evacuations-from-geo-barents-after-baby-born-at-sea?fbclid=IwAR3tJ68_s76Gn4BUn--XssRNSb5Ca0kt3jp0WUJj3VwwgRXEKbZmiegKHuM) though 248 people remain onboard awaiting a safe port\. The first mother gave birth on the boat and endured seven hours of labour at sea brought on by the stress of the journey she had undertaken from Libya\. At first Italian authorities suggested that they would evacuate only her and her newborn, leaving her three other sons on board\. They have now all been accepted on Lampedusa along with [33 people from the Louise Michel](https://twitter.com/MVLouiseMichel/status/1601203775238070277/photo/1) \. The other pregnant woman who is also at full term has been taken to Malta\.

[A young boy of fourteen](https://twitter.com/MSF_Prensa/status/1601198989269151744/photo/1) who was travelling alone and suffering from abdominal pain has also been taken from the ship to Sicily\.

[261 people have been given safe harbor in Bari](https://www.ilpost.it/2022/12/09/humanity-1-migranti-sbarco-bari/) , Italy from the Humanity1 Vessel\.

Being held at sea and prevented from landing after long and arduous journeys is in itself a traumatizing experience and this practice must end\.
#### Iuventa to be Restored

The Court on Trapani has ruled that extensive maintenance work must be carried out on the Iuventa in order to restore it to the condition it was in before the seizure in August 2017\.


**GREECE**
#### Police Violence

In a week which [commemorated the murder of 15 year\-old Alexandros Grigoropoulos](https://thepressproject.gr/the-murder-of-alexandros-grigoropoulos/) by the police and [during which the police shot another unarmed 16 year\-old, Kostas Fragoulis, in the head](https://racistcrimeswatch.wordpress.com/2022/12/06/1-1397/) , No Name Kitchen have been collecting testimony about police violence against people on the move in Patras\.

#### People trapped on Evros Islet

On the 8th of December Alarm Phone were informed of a group of people trapped on an islet in Evros\. The officer they contacted at the Soufli border guard station then informed them that they had searched the area and found no one\. However, this islet is divided between Greek and Turkish territory and [it is likely to be the same area were people were trapped during the summer](https://twitter.com/lk2015r/status/1601279830204370944?t=gV_jBBshj4X7W9RwqA1YSg&s=19&fbclid=IwAR1b1z4aKS8QR8-PwTaIpyk0-oZSQMc-79NxQguFrpgnFj_2IHvQr_gSt-0) when both countries refused to initiate rescue [leading to disagreement between political parties in Greece](https://twitter.com/g_christides/status/1559834010452467713) \. [The Greek Ministry of Citizen Protection has stated that the coordinates which were shared are not in Greek territory](https://www.tanea.gr/2022/12/09/greece/evros-synagermos-gia-omada-metanaston-se-nisida-anikei-stin-tourkiki-epikrateia/) \. [Either side’s ability to accurately state the division of the territory of this tiny islet has also been called into question](https://endiaferon.github.io/evros-islet-border-facts/) as it is based on a map from 1926 of poor scale\. Meanwhile the use of people in distress to further arguments between two governments puts people’s lives at risk\. [In August this led to the death of a five\-year\-old girl\.](ays-news-digest-10-8-22-a-5-year-old-girl-died-on-evros-her-family-still-remains-there-helpless-869b6d619c2d)


The individuals who were on the islet have not been heard from since their families raised the alarm and their fate is unknown at the time of writing\.

**BULGARIA**
#### First Video of EU border shooting

This week Lighthouse reports published the video of a young man, 19\-year\-old Abdullah Mohammed, being shot at the Bulgarian border with Turkey along with his testimony of his experience\. [The vehicles seen at the scene and the uniforms worn by the men present in witness videos match those of the Bulgarian border force](https://twitter.com/LHreports/status/1599796147140194304) \.

Please be aware that this tweet shows the non\-fatal shooting of a teenager\.

His group was pushed back. Footage shows some of them throwing stones at the Bulgarian border in protest.

**SWITZERLAND**

A press conference was held on the 9th of December outside the UNHCR headquarters in Geneva highlighting the treatment of people on the move in Libya\. Today \(10th of December\) they call for a march through Geneva\.


There have been [many reports written about the situations faced by people on the move in Libya](https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/libya/report-libya/) and [those who are returned there](https://www.rescue.org/uk/press-release/irc-extremely-concerned-about-safety-migrants-and-refugees-being-returned-libya) by the [EU funded Libyan Coast Guard](https://reliefweb.int/report/libya/eu-funded-boats-abusive-libyan-coastguard-underline-european-complicity-grave) \. The situation in detention facilities have been described as so bad that [they may amount to crimes against humanity](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/03/1114842) \. In October of this year the bodies of 15 people on the move were found in Sabratah\.


> Eleven charred bodies were found inside the docked boat with a further four wounded bodies found outside\. — [_UNSMIL_](https://twitter.com/UNSMILibya/status/1579104323648491520) 





These murders are thought to have been carried out by rival traffickers\. While Libya remains in an unstable and dangerous state with no single government it cannot be considered a safe country for people on the move and people must not be returned there\.

**EU**
#### Black sites, cages and torture

A further report from Lighthouse highlighted the continued use of cages at EU borders which [we reported about in 2019 in Bosnia](https://ba.voanews.com/a/bih-migranti-u-kavezima/4886022.html) \. They also discovered shipping containers in Hungary & prison vans in Croatia which are being routinely used by authorities to imprison people & prevent them claiming asylum\.

This wasn’t an isolated incident. Today we place it in a wider system at EU borders reliant on black sites, cages &amp; torture
