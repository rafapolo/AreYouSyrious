### Feature: The Mediterranean remains the deadliest route

More than 111,000 people have made it to Europe by sea as of 16 December, the IOM reports \(via [InfoMigrants](http://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/14000/more-than-110-000-migrants-arrived-in-europe-via-mediterranean-in-2018) \) \. At the same time, around 2200 deaths were recorded\. According to its Missing Migrants Project, this equals almost half of the 4400 deaths worldwide\. But both numbers are assumed likely to be higher, as it is hard to keep track or even find out about about every incident\. A huge increase in deaths could be seen at the route between North Africa and Spain this year\. While 224 were reported in 2017 to have died trying to cross the sea here, there have been 744 in 2018 so far\. Compared to the previous years, the number of people arriving in Europe dropped from 358,000 in 2016 \(5000 deaths\) and 168,000 in 2017 \(3100 deaths\) to now 111,000\.

But at the same time it should be noted, that more than 6600 people on the move were recorded as having died within Africa since 2013\. This year alone 1386 deaths were registered on the continent\. However, these numbers are not necessarily accurate — and probably higher\. The records “are based on surveys conducted by the Mixed Migration Centre’s Monitoring Mechanism Initiative,” the IOM [states](https://www.iom.int/news/gmdac-over-6600-migration-deaths-recorded-africa-2013-just-tip-iceberg) , saying those surveys only represent a small fraction of the overall number of people on the move in Africa\. They admit: “These thousands of deaths are likely a substantial undercount of the true number\.”


> Starvation, dehydration, physical abuse, sickness and lack of access to medicines are causes of death frequently cited by the migrants who reported deaths on routes within Africa\. 





Adding both numbers, it means that 3600 out of 4400 — 80 percent — of the people, who die while migrating, leave from African countries\. Just yesterday, Nador [reported](https://www.facebook.com/Nador.new2019/photos/a.152984038796994/366300704131992/?type=3&theater) another incident off the shore of Morocco and more than 230 people attempting to reach Europe\.

### Morocco

The Association Marocaine des Droits Humains reports, that dozens of people have been arrested at the central station in Nador\.

### Greece

Human Rights Watch [collected](https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/12/18/greece-violent-pushbacks-turkey-border) evidence of violent push\-backs at the Greek\-Turkish land border\.


> “People who have not committed a crime are detained, beaten, and thrown out of Greece without any consideration for their rights or safety,” 




said Todor Gardos, Europe researcher at Human Rights Watch\. The team interviewed 26 people in Greece in May and in October and November in Turkey\. They described 24 incidents of push\-backs across the Evros river, which marks the border between both countries\.

Although there is no physical violence against people on Samos, the harsh weather conditions still make the people suffer\.

[Action for women](https://www.facebook.com/actionforwomenCH/posts/1509681245843026?hc_location=ufi) is looking for female translators on Chios\.

On Lesvos, activists [called](https://www.facebook.com/pikpalesvos/posts/2241163159492436) for demonstrations in Mytilene today\. They demand that racist attacks be treated as such by the authorities\. In the beginning of December, a Bangladeshi worker was attacked by a man with a crowbar\.

IOM [revealed](https://greece.iom.int/sites/default/files/MONTHLY%20NEWSLETTER%20REINTEGRATION_NOVEMBER%202018.pdf) , that some 3800 people from 29 countries returned from Greece to their country of origin within the framework of the assisted voluntary return programme \(AVRR\) between June 2016 and November 2018\. With 1500 people returning, the Pakistani were the biggest group followed by Georgians with 500 people\. However, it is questionable how voluntary this move really is\. Like in other countries, for some this might be the only alternative to not being deported by force\. According to IOM, 2200 of these people are considered vulnerable cases\.

The [Mobile Team for refugees in Greece](https://www.facebook.com/mobileinfoteam/photos/a.1800063030222418/2338542279707821/?type=3&theater) reports that the asylum offices in Thessaloniki and Athens will be closed on 25–26 December and on 1 January\. Longer waiting times should be expected over the holidays\.
### Serbia

As winter approaches in Eastern Europe, the living conditions of the people become harder and harder\. For some this is the second or even third winter at closed borders\. “People keep returning from push\-backs insufficiently protected, claiming that police officers took away their clothes,” No Name Kitchen [says](https://www.facebook.com/NoNameKitchenBelgrade/posts/640469219684699) \.


[![No Name Kitchen]( "No Name Kitchen")](https://www.facebook.com/NoNameKitchenBelgrade/posts/640469219684699)


But at least for some the snow can also mean joy and a feeling of ordinary life\.

### Germany

After the ECJ [confirmed](https://rp-online.de/politik/deutschland/europaeischer-gerichtshof-kanzlerin-merkel-handelte-in-fluechtlingskrise-legal_aid-16786653) in July 2017 that Angela Merkel acted in accordance with the Dublin regulation when keeping open Germany’s borders and allowing refugees to enter the country in autumn of 2015, the Constitutional Court in Germany has [now](http://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/14002/german-court-rejects-afd-s-complaint-over-angela-merkel-s-refugee-policy?fbclid=IwAR25HhTp5p8ApT9UPVKPYboNTP4QcF6VOuUxhyPStIpxGsbikLzhUR8uc70) also rejected three complaints of the far\-right AfD against this decision\.
### France

The basic rights of people in Northern France as well as in Paris have been violated for years\. This has not only been known for a long time already, but also recognized by France’s ombudsman for human rights, Jacques Toubon, saying this was “unprecedented”, as [Yahoo/AFP report](https://news.yahoo.com/migrants-france-suffering-unprecedented-abuses-rights-ombudsman-153137517.html?fbclid=IwAR3aFohWgz1RcJam6dsEI6KzsyQ5sze4-SmqULL-Kv91_pG-iWQUUtuXj6A) \. People have been “in a state of extreme destitution, deprived of all shelter and preoccupied with trying to fulfill their basic needs: to eat, to drink and to wash”\. He further criticized that the situation has significantly worsened since the demolition of the Calais Jungle in October 2016\. The authorities are trying to make the people invisible and criminalize them, using tear gas, taking away their belongings\. In only one year, NGOs on the ground recorded 153 incidents when tear gas was used\.

Solidarité migrants Wilson in France is looking for volunteers to help with the next food distribution on Tuesday, 25 December\. Tomorrow, on Thursday, they will be at Avenue du Président\-Wilson to provide tea, coffee and toast\.

### Denmark

Up to 2000 people came together in Copenhagen as the Financial Act of 2019 was passed in Parliament\. This includes, that all refugees should be only temporarily accommodated in Denmark\. The day before they’d given out Christmas letters in more than 30 out of 52 municipalities all over Denmark: Christmas letters to fellow humans saying: “All we want for Christmas is a future for our children”\.
