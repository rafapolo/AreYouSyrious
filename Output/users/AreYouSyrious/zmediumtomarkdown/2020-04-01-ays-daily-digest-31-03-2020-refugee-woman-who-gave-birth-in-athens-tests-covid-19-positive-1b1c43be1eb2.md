### FEATURE: A woman who gave birth on Sunday at a hospital in Athens, tests positive for COVID\-19\. She was living in a refugee camp in Ritsona, northeast of Athens\.

She was tested on Tuesday, as well as the baby and the baby’s father\. Both of them were found to be negative\. According to Greek media, the government response includes:


> “The National Public Health Organization \(EODY\) has sent a team to the camp to investigate whether the unnamed woman was infected there or after leaving the facility\. EODY will also try to trace everyone she may have to come into contact with\. 





> Authorities at Ritsona have created isolation quarters for people displaying symptoms of Covid\-19\.” 





[10 of the hospital staff](https://www.lesvosnews.net/articles/news-categories/ellada/thetiki-gynaika-ston-koronoio-apo-ti-domi-filoxenias-metanaston?fbclid=IwAR1sYYI-bCxoZH3MKKs-LTDjQdkchFkGIDEX_vCU9c2CEsTu4_KeXCIn6sA) who came into contact with her are in quarantine\. It is still very unclear as to where she got the virus, because another person who she lived with tested negative as well\.

The narrative in the TV media however has not been kind\. Καμιά Ανοχή explains:


> “The media tv narrative did not miss an opportunity to frame the news with xenophobic hints, as if what we were missing in the deadly pandemic It’s the excess of racism and misogyny\. 





> Stop \(putting the\) blame on people, especially those and those that the state consciously left in the horrible concentration camps\. In Ritsona Live 2800 prosphýgisses and refugees in miserable conditions, as in Moria, Bial and in every outdoor prison created to shut up the hope of the refugees for a new life\.” 




Of course a pregnant woman whose living in a refugee camp has contracted the virus\. Pregnant women all of the world have gotten the virus during the pandemic\. It’s not a shock that the lack of resources and attention given to refugees, and being generally prepared, has resulted in this woman’s unfortunate situation\. We cannot change what people didn’t do in the past, but we can try our best to change the response moving forward\. **Greece needs to alleviate it’s refugee camps\. Greece must evacuate the islands\. Solidarity now\!**
#### TUNISIA

The Middle East Monitor is reporting that the Tunisian Foreign Minister Noureddine Erray is mobilizing financial support for Palestinian refugees during the pandemic with the UNRWA\. The Foreign Minister stressed that Tunsia is behind the Palestinian cause\.

![“This morning at 01\.30, **two life rafts carrying 39 people, 7 children, 12 women and 20 men** , was found drifting close to the Greek sea boarder outside Dikili\. **According to the statement from the passengers, obtained by TCG, Greek coast guard had put them in the rafts and left them at the Turkish sea border\.** In one week six life rafts carrying refugees has been detected by TCG, similar statement has been given in all six cases\. The rafts have been found from Datça in the south to Dikili in the north, a stretch of 170 miles\. To pick up people from boats heading to Greece, inside Greek waters, force them in to life rafts and leave them in a helpless state at the border, would be a violation of international maritime law, if this in fact is the case\. The last two incidents was most likely heading to Lesvos south\.” Photo by [Aegean Boat Report](https://www.facebook.com/AegeanBoatReport/posts/801935850329521?hc_location=ufi)](assets/1b1c43be1eb2/1*Q0oirGVNuNxK6rWzFiwvbg.jpeg)

### Here is some tragically excellent footage by ReFOCUS Media Labs and edited by Yousef Eldin on the situation in Lesvos

[This is reality](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-52095552/coronavirus-protecting-yourself-in-a-migrant-camp?fbclid=IwAR25mAA3ZhhEbrVzs8tKLtCD52M1PKG3ZiSzsovKbq8oytgCLaPxJngJ1aE) …and it’s looming\. Brace yourselves for what April and May might bring\.

Stand by Me’s facility on Lesvos was destroyed in a fire on Tuesday morning\. Since this is the third organization on Lesvos having problems with fire, the investigators are not ruling out arson\.

### Greek Media reported that Greece will open some ports to accepting people from Libya, so that they can relocated to other member countries\.

[Crete](https://www.efsyn.gr/efkriti/koinonia/237296_stin-kriti-oi-metanastes-apo-ti-libyi) seems to be chosen as the first port:


> “Specifically, the government appears to have accepted Crete as a place of destination for immigrants, which will be engaged in a business aimed at monitoring the eastern Mediterranean region to prevent alleged arms trafficking in Libya, it said in a statement\. Member of Heraklion, Syriza, Socrates Vardakis\.” 





Human Rights Watch said in a report on Tuesday:


> “Greek authorities are arbitrarily detaining nearly 2,000 migrants and asylum seekers in unacceptable conditions, and denying them the right to lodge asylum claims, in two recently established detention sites on mainland Greece, Human Rights Watch said today\. Authorities claim they are holding the new arrivals, including children, persons with disabilities, older people, and pregnant women, in quarantine due to COVID\-19, but the absence of even basic health precautions is likely to help the virus spread\.” 




_“If the government is serious about preventing COVID\-19 transmission and illness among migrants and asylum seekers, it needs to scale up testing, provide more tents, and give people enough toilets, water, and soap, and put in place prevention interventions,” said Belkis Wille, senior Crisis and Conflict researcher at Human Rights Watch\. “Forcing people, some of whom are at high risk of severe disease or death, to live in dirty and unsanitary conditions, cramped together in close quarters, is a recipe for spreading the virus, not to mention is degrading and inhumane\.”_ [Read the full report here\.](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/03/31/greece-nearly-2000-new-arrivals-detained-overcrowded-mainland-camps?fbclid=IwAR3MOSCPTcMkvwE98SgyLaD--AGkww18SIA398uNeC4GPyN0IEQh49XaxkY#)

#### CYPRUS
### At least 175 people are stranded at sea after Cyprus is refusing to accept them due to COVID\-19 fears\.

As part of a new law, only Cyprians and others with special permits are allowed to enter into the country during the pandemic\. The police boat came near enough to the overcrowded dinghy for a police translator to speak in Arabic about the new rules\. [Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/cyprus-pushes-syrian-refugees-sea-due-coronavirus-200330091614066.html?fbclid=IwAR2XpibzIlBsY0vgomHqdApM9UqldmRRjCYohJGbUpb8KdkzKhNtsXXQqdA) spoke to a few persons on board and one of them said:


> “It was very crowded, the waves were high and the boat was moving a lot\. I held my children tight\. The police said you cannot enter because of the coronavirus, we said we were joining our husbands and families and if you are scared about coronavirus you can put us in a camp alone or quarantine\. But they refused and then the boats started to circle\.” 




Suspending asylum now is against international law\. We must protect the most vulnerable persons from contracting this virus\.

#### SLOVENIA

In the ECRE ‘s 2019 update on the aslyum system in Soleniva, they give an overview of the main changes since the 2018 report:

**_“Asylum procedure_**
1. _Effective excess to the asylum procedure continued to be the main problem in 2019\._
2. _The lengthiness of the procedure increased significantly\. Asylum seekers had to wait up to 15 days to be able to lodge their application for international protection and, by the end of the year, more than 30% of individuals had waited more than six months for the first instance decision\._
3. _Only 85 people were granted international protection in 2019\. For the first time Eritrean asylum seekers were issued negative decisions on their asylum applications\._


**_Reception conditions_**
1. _Reception capacity…lower hygienic standards and health risks\._
2. _A systematic solution for unaccompanied minors was not found in 2019\._


**_Detention of asylum seekers_**
1. _Due to the increase in numbers of asylum seekers and the backlog of cases, applicants were de facto detained on the premises of the Asylum Home or its branch while waiting to lodge their application for international protection\._
2. _No legislative changes were made in 2019, however the Supreme Court decision on the provisions of the IPA in March 2019 suspended the detention of asylum seekers due to the lack of provisions defining the ‘risk of absconding’\.”_

In Italy, the affect of the management of the COVID\-19 outbreak and worsening conditions for those already precarious and locked up have lead to riots inside prisons\. 





> With borders closed and flights canceled, deportations are not possible\. Judges have liberated many people from detention centers\. **The CRAs however are not empty\. Throughout France, they have been filled with foreigners released from prisons\.** 





> In Calais, in CRA Coquelles, after the initial releases, only two people were in detention\. Last week, there were 76 people\. With the CRA under construction, there is place for no more than 60 people\. \(Update: at the moment, there are “only” 8 people, all of them were brought in directly from prison\. \) The association which is supposed to provide legal support inside the CRA has been physically absent, and will continue to be so, since confinement measures have been put in place in France\. Visits are not allowed\. The PAF \(Police Aux Frontieres — border police\), to protect themselves, has suggested closing the CRA\. Only one nurse is working\. People are not able to receive any supplies from outside\. There is a lack of soap and shampoo, enough for one shower a week\. 





> In CRAs, detainees are [speaking out](https://abaslescra.noblogs.org/tag/coronavirus/) against worsened conditions and detention\. 





> [**During a turbulent time, once again, the state punishes more those already in precocity\. Abolish detention centers\! Abolish all prisons\!**](https://calaismigrantsolidarity.wordpress.com/2020/03/30/cra-coquelles-packed-cra-coquelles-bonde/?fbclid=IwAR1_POZL304qEXTQtx_ofsDuTvEKwagJZ0P5qsFb71DHPNLe-GxbEZAlkD4) 





[Several organizations](http://www.rfi.fr/fr/france/20200330-coronavirus-l-impossible-confinement-migrants-calais) have written to the UN to demand that it force the French state to protect the 1,200 people living in Calais from COVID\-19\.

Also for our French speakers, [this video](https://www.facebook.com/FRANCE24/videos/263809048090095/?__xts__[0]=68.ARC6tAn4HKJrWWjqXs5mA8GFeqv8CAishacS0eziuSckBSHnEIJStggRC9OfJAkcMOhKpAvApxhcdZq7b9uhln1kfhF7YWKtgsNS3QeO-SVy5iquu9yGxl2_HtkmLcUAsZdufQJnVHGFotZilW8LtCKwF5w4p2rnmsX5gyUCgBD6iU0DxGGRHFWt5QJQUNOla_tFNX3Ri7wcgxuSo2JYi6HiGv3aCw6HzSFGVJG92m4sRSfDTJXd12LfaVNQA3lstcIVx8YYHXZTpo0MBrRWqcmaLFTQocoMy05t70JFgfqIEo7IjJor-HEothDTFeNtSqYg9VPp9UOOdDYb4cpALQkvpezCtsVX&__tn__=-R) talks about the hundred of refugees who are still living on the street in Paris and what you can do to help them\.

We need solidarity to protect all those living on the street and in refugees camps everywhere\!
#### DENMARK

The Danish MEP Margrethe Auken calls in the [daily Information publication](https://www.information.dk/debat/2020/03/sf-evakuer-flygtninge-hoejrisikogruppen-graeske-flygtningelejre?fbclid=IwAR0UATTYib2FrjyTW2m0GWLIrus6PUSLxbLgfkxs4uo2_h8oy8QB--YW4Rs) for an immediate evacuation of the most high\-risk and vulnerable groups in the Greek refugee camps and for and for increased economic support to the Greek islands in light of the Corona virus crisis threatening the refugee camps:


> “Danish society is already under pressure, but we must be able to take care of the weak — even outside the country\. If the COVID\-19 breaks out seriously in the Greek islands, hell is loose and thousands will die\.”

### In a demonstration outside of Oslo on Tuesday, 7499 pairs of shoes were placed on Ulvøya beach\.

[Each pair of shoes](https://www.aftenposten.no/norge/i/RReyM8/plasserte-ut-7499-par-sko-paa-strand-i-oslo-for-demonstrere-for-barn-paa-lesbos?fbclid=IwAR3JlT7YwrXBOqEJ7hOp5Zx2hmeiQThIvyIsbfLOOg09LHKI9GODXK1BJCM) represents a child or young person stuck living in Moria and as a refugee on Lesvos\.

Originally, the shoes were going to be placed in front of the Norwegian parliament, but plans changed due to the pandemic\. One single pair of shoes will be placed the capital’s steps on Wednesday in solidarity\. An online demonstration will be happening at the same time in the afternoon\. 9,000 people are counting have signed up for the demonstration on Facebook\.

> **Join us for a webinar on 2 April** , organized by the CCCM Cluster and PHAP, to learn about COVID\-19 prevention measures critical to the work of Camp Managers and others working in displacement settings\. You will hear from WASH specialists, as well as experienced Camp program staff who have recently been involved in setting up special measures to prevent the spread of disease and develop key messages for populations living in temporary settlements\. A representative from Sphere will also provide guidance for how the Sphere Handbook can be a useful tool for practitioners in this situation\.”
