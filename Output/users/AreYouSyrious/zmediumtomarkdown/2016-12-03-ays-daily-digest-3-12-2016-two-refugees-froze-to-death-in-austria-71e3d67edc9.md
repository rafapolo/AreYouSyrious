### AYS DAILY DIGEST 3/12/2016: Two refugees froze to death in Austria

_Another devastating day in Europe: people froze to death, die in the sea while trying to cross, deprived of freedom of movement, deprived of freedom and basic human rights\. All this in Europe millions are dreaming about_


![According to the MSF, 2016 was the deadliest year in the sea for people who are trying to cross and come to Europe\.](assets/71e3d67edc9/1*j4XtP9oZfwS8hMcDb3KeCA.jpeg)

According to the MSF, 2016 was the deadliest year in the sea for people who are trying to cross and come to Europe\.
### FEATURE STORY

This insane policy of close border is taking more people’s life every day in Europe\. Devastating news today are coming from Austria: two refugees, a man, and a woman have been run over by truck that was leaving a wagon train\. It happened at the station of Wörgl, Tirol, near the city of Innsbruck\. Police assumed, that they froze to death before\.

Another refugee, man, has been injured and transported in serious condition to the University Clinic in Innsbruck\.

None of the refugees had any documents with them\.

The train started in Verona and crossed the Brenner, which is 1\.400 high\. It was freezing cold there last night\. This route is the fastest way from Italy to Germany for many refugees\.

Authorities are investigating what exactly happened\. According to the first available info, the three were hiding on a car carrying truck and were crushed during the unloading of lorries\.

A few days ago, an Eritrean boy of 17 years died in the Bolzano station, overwhelmed in trying to board a freight train in Austria\.
### Sea

Aquarius, [Doctors Without Borders](https://medium.com/u/893ddca64e30) and [SOS Mediterranian France](http://www.sosmediterranee.fr) boats rescued 143 people from a rubber boat on Saturday\. Many people were saved from the water\. MSF doctors treated several cases of hypothermia\. So far this year, MSF teams have rescued 19\.708 people\.

In the past three years, 11\.701 people have died in the Mediterranean\. Only this year, at least 4\.690 men, women, and children have died while trying to reach Europe by the sea from Africa and Turkey, which is almost 1\.000 more than last year\. **MSF claims 2016 is the deadliest year so far\.**


> “Despite the shocking figures and the immense loss of life, the European response in the Central Mediterranean continues to focus on deterrence measures rather than on saving lives,” the MSF said\. 





Out of total number of arrivals to Italy, 16 percent are kids, 88 percent are unaccompanied\. The youngest unaccompanied kid MSF team met this year was 8 years old\.

Last night, boat Phoenix by [MOAS team](https://www.moas.eu) rescued a small wooden boat carrying 44 people, including 3 children\. Last night, around 130 people landed in Cagliari and on Sulcis’s coasts\.

Spanish authorities reported rescue of 92 persons traveling in five makeshift boats\. Among those rescued were 63 people from sub\-Saharan Africa, officials said without specifying their nationalities, and 29 Algerians\.

Most of the people were taken to the port of Malaga, southern Spain\.

The group included three women and a child as well as a boy who had to be hospitalized after suffering from hypothermia\.
### Greece

The issue of unaccompanied children among refugees remains the unresolved issue all over Europe, as well as in Greece\. [Local media are reporting](http://www.ekathimerini.com/214269/article/ekathimerini/news/migrant-children-await-hostel-spots) that more than 1\.200 children are now on waiting lists to be relocated to one of the country’s special hostels for vulnerable children\. Government sources are estimating that around 2\.500 unaccompanied minors are among over 62\.000 refugees in this country\.
### Useful info for refugee from The Mobile Info Team

**_How do you get the birth certificate_**

If you give birth while in Greece you must provide your newborn baby with a birth certificate\. Generally, it is advisable to get help from an organization or volunteers in your camp with that\. More info about this and other important issues for refugees in Greece could be found at t [he Mobil Info Team FB page](https://www.facebook.com/mobileinfoteam/posts/1878796765682377:0) \.

### Bulgaria

Out of 160 million euros, EU relocated to Bulgaria for refugees, around 80 per cent will be spent on border protection and security\.Other 20 percent will go on improving capacities in asylum centers\. Apparently, 50\.000 euros will be spent to repair the damage caused during clashes in Harmanli center on 24 November\. Part of the center will be turned into the closed facility, while the center in Pastrogor, near the border with Turkey, will be fully transformed into a closed facility\. That will cost around 1\.1 million euros\. Bulgaria’s outgoing Interior Ministry Rumyana Bachvarova has said authorities are preparing to restrict the movement of migrants within Bulgaria’s territory\. [Authorities plan to set up parameter within refugees in Bulgaria will be able to move](http://www.novinite.com/articles/177784/Bulgaria+to+Curb+Movement+of+Migrants#sthash.AO3jSJbj.dpuf) \.

Additionally, Bulgarian government will invest money EU tax payers are giving them to increase security measures in the camps because, as they said, “the moment a center becomes closed, it generates aggression\.” So far, nobody in EU objected these plans or said anything about violence used by Bulgarian authorities during unrests in Harmanli, or everything that happens after\.

Plan about increase security measures and limits on freedom of movement for refugees in Bulgaria were announced this summer when the government approved measures that pave the way for the introduction of a restricted movement regime\.
### Serbia


> Good, news from Serbia\. Kelebija Community Center will reopen on Sunday\. 
 

>  
 

> “We are having to reorganize our services at the moment, so we are limited to charging, wifi, and respite in heated tents, but in this terrible weather, it’s better than nothing\!” 





[Earlier this week we reported](https://medium.com/@AreYouSyrious/ays-daily-digest-01-12-the-strongest-have-been-broken-5c60b1d610dc#.8tzvsmr8o) on attempts by the Serbian authorities to crack down on some spots they deem obnoxious, and the first victim was this community center\.
### Hungary

Hundreds of people protested today in Budapest against Ahmed H\. conviction and for freedom of Roszke 11\.

Ahmed H\. from Syria has been jailed for 10 years on terrorism charges in a case that has become a cornerstone of the country’s crackdown on refugees, as [we reported earlier this week](https://medium.com/@AreYouSyrious/ays-digest-30-11-winter-arrives-in-force-to-greece-bb9f750b8e99#.fq5jspqbl) \. Ahmed was arrested on the Hungarian\-Serbian border in September 2015 and accused of orchestrating clashes between refugees and police\.
### Italy

In Pordenone, northeast Italy in the Friuli\-Venezia Giulia region, around ten people are living outside in the cold weather, sleeping in blankets, wrapped in coats and fed by few volunteers and private citizens\. The area where they sleep, a parking lot, is known to local as the Bronx\. They are asylum seeker who obtained their status, but they do not know how to find a house and a job\.

Volunteers from Rete Solidale are taking care of them, bringing blankets, clothes, shoes, food\.


> “The number of people sleeping in Bronx parking lot swings widely, they are not bound to the territory, usually between 3 and 10 people\. They could be helped by finding a house, but they are residents abroad, and this drives us mad: it would be really easy to find a solution to shelter them,” [Rete Solidale told the media\.](http://react-text: 205 http://messaggeroveneto.gelocal.it/.../notti-al-gelo-l...) 




### Germany

Despite protests and news about more atrocities and instability, the German government is determined to deport people back to Afghanistan\. [New deportations are planned for December\.](http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/bundesregierung-bereitet-sammel-abschiebung-von-afghanen-vor-a-1124211.html)

In October this year, Germany signed an agreement with Afghanistan about deportations\. Number of NGOs protested claiming that Afghanistan is not a safe country, but it did not change the plan\.

Even more, the government announced the plan to set up a camp in Tunisia, close to the Libyan border, so refugees who are saved crossing the Mediterranean will be brought there\. From this place, they should be able to apply for asylum in Germany or other EU countries\. This is their plan to reduce the number of people trying to cross the Sea\.

These tents are the home of dozens of refugee children at the Serbian/Hungarian border\. The SIRIUS\.HELP team tries to make conditions more livable for children and their parents\.

_“The past few nights have been at sub\-zero temperatures around Izmir\. It’s frigging cold\. We keep meeting more and more new arrivals who have next to nothing\. Over the past 2 weeks, we’ve met and documented another 500 people who just arrived from Syria\. Heard stories of long, tiring journeys, little belongings left to people’s names\. Now, essentials needed to keep warm get borrowed\. We wanted to address heating needs as part of the winterizing project\. And with the sharp drop in temperatures, we also wanted to act fast\. With around 500 families in total and roughly 3,000 people documented, we asked where heating was needed\. Close to 200 families, 1,000 people, urgently needed heating\._

_So rather than giving heaters as a handout, we subsidized and asked for £5 contributions, so the deal was roughly “half/half”\. This was a good idea, people thought\. And it allowed us to help 50% more people off the initial investment, by reinvesting the £5 contributions back into buying more subsidized heaters\. Over the last week, we delivered what was asked 200 heaters\.”_
