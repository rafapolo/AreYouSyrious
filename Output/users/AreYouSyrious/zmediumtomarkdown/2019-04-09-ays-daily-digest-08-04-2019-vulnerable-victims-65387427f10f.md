### Libya

As new fights erupt in Libya, people on the run and detainees are trapped in the middle of the conflict\. Journalist Sally Hayden [received](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/04/libya-detained-refugees-terrified-clashes-tripoli-rage-190407172920412.html?utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&utm_content=5caa962be6dfda0001dca51d&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=facebook&fbclid=IwAR3a7Lr3h_OG-f0ZNrwwK9bKmijX5ZvBVM7Tk-Ur2-Td35TQV-xnXsyyNJM) information about 600 people in Qasr bin Ghashir detention center in urgent need of help, as they are lacking in food and water\.

Because of this unsafe situation, MSF renewed its appeal to evacuate people trapped in the country and not send back rescued people in cooperation with the so\-called Libyan Coast Guard\. According to [IOM](https://twitter.com/IOM_Libya/status/1115207313957191680?fbclid=IwAR2x-wa2ROZteyneBKiSCfucT_93KXigKXdM1MuwTkDpnXOzi7Ry3Qk5W8o) , more than 2,800 people have been displaced since the beginning of the conflict in Tripoli and more than 1,300 people in detention centers near the clashes are at risk\.

> > This is the 3rd time in the past 7 months that #Tripoli has seen conflict, yet many trapped in detention are there because of EU policies that enable the Libyan Coast Guard to return people to #Libya in violation of international law. #Libya is clearly not a place of safety.

### Sea

It has been three months now that the Open Arms has [not been able](https://www.facebook.com/proactivaservice/photos/a.232810050083187/2353572078006963/?type=3&theater) to operate in the Mediterranean\. At the same time, Europa Press [reports](https://twitter.com/europapress/status/1114998326057947141?fbclid=IwAR3b-Ps1yU3JVBVN4T7RJ9prooHlfmr92cPSuASe51Kt4OuIT_qp1N81_4w) that the number of people crossing the sea to Spain in March has dropped by 37%, while the number of deaths has risen by 179%, compared with the earlier month\. For 63 people the crossing had a lucky ending: they were rescued by the Alan Kurdi\. But since 3rd April they are waiting to disembark at a safe harbour\.

> > Manuel ha 6 anni e, insieme alle 63 persone soccorse con lui, dal 3 apr è bloccato in alto mare a bordo di #AlanKurdi senza un porto sicuro in cui approdare. 

Proviamo vergogna per quest’Europa  crudele, incapace di garantire i diritti umani dei più piccoli, dei più vulnerabili. https://t.co/zv3HR6CFpE

### Belgium

[Plateforme citoyenne de soutien aux réfugiés Bruxelles](https://www.facebook.com/bxlrefugees/posts/830348857304078) is looking for volunteers on Tuesday to pick up and transport 120 beds between 12am and 7pm\. The adress is Porte d’Ulysse, 6 rue du planeur à Haren, behind Decathlon\.

### Germany

A man from Ghana has been attacked in a train in Munich\. Media [report](https://www.abendzeitung-muenchen.de/inhalt.am-rosenheimer-platz-muenchen-rassist-schlaegt-mann-aus-ghana-glasflasche-ins-gesicht.21a26f7c-f1b0-4e37-b378-6f83ee4b0fe6.html?fbclid=IwAR34FQPW1gF2EvsVEmcoFe2YyQWla4w8W4eUMd9lPSzp3tvdNH1Khot2Tbc) that he was first insulted by a racist and later hit in the face with a bottle\. The attacker escaped and the federal police is investigating the case\.
### Austria

Austrian and German media [report](https://www.rtl.de/cms/susanne-b-aus-salzburg-ist-fassungslos-braeutigam-kurz-vor-trauung-nach-italien-abgeschoben-4320445.html?fbclid=IwAR2v1bkpLlPWqf_PIK_tAl9OcSFk-yM0cJDg-s128fg4l0GAF9mjjh0kf6U) that a man from Gambia was detained only minutes before his wedding\. He is supposed to be deported to Italy because he is a Dublin case\. It seems that the procedure itself was legal, as the marriage would not have changed anything about his status\. However, the action has been criticized\.
### Denmark

MOVE published a shadow report to the UN Committee on the Eliminiation of Discrimination against Women with the focus on migrants and asylum seekers\.

### Europe

With almost 55,000 requests, Germany had the most outgoing Dublin procedures in 2018, Asylum in Europe reports\. The 25,000 cases incoming were the second highest value after Italy with 31\.000\. France had some 45\.000 outgoing requests\. “These figures indicate that nearly one in three asylum seekers in Germany and France were subject to a Dublin procedure”, they conclude\. At the same time, France, Italy, Croatia, Cyprus, Malta and Poland were among the countries increasing the use of the Dublin procedure in 2018\. In most of the countries, the number was lower than in 2017\.
