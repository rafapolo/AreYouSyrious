### AYS DAILY DIGEST 22\.03\.2018: Madina Hussiny’s Family At Risk of Forced Return to Serbia…Again\.

_Croatian authorities possibly to return at\-risk families to Serbia, families left in bureaucratic limbo for days\! How bureaucratic and physical violence intersect // Turkey criticized for suppression of Kurds and for repelling Syrian refugees // Greek Afghan Community of Migrants and Refugees Office Attacked by Nazi Group // Portugese Asylum System fails refugees // Volunteers in France remember young refugee Nour, whose severe mental health was neglected by his caretakers // Germany to proceed with dysfunctional and discriminatory migration management plan\. // Finland’s rejection of asylum seekers not due to policy, due to ambiguous practice\._

### FEATURE: Vulnerable families again subjected to institutional violence, risk being pushed back quietly\.

On the night of March 21, AYS was again contacted by Madina Hussiny’s family members from the territory of Croatia with the intention to seek asylum\. AYS team immediately informed the police, Ombudsperson, the family’s lawyer and UNHCR\. Our volunteer went to the border and he was present when the police accompanied them to the police station\.

He had a brief interview with the police and he repeatedly stressed that they wanted international protection\.


> In the morning of the same day, AYS contacted the police, and we were informed that the family is still in the station, that they expressed the intention for seeking international protection in Croatia and that the following procedure would include their arrival to the reception center Porin\. 




However, today we were informed that the family has been transferred to Tovarnik center, which is a transit center, mostly for readmission, at the border with Serbia\. The family’s lawyer has sent the letter to the Asylum Department of the MoI, urging them to ensure that the family is registered in the MoI database as asylum seekers and get the registration document that will permit the transfer to the reception center, in accordance with the Croatian law\. It should be known that this is the FOURTH attempt of the Hussiny family to claim asylum in Croatia\. The first of their attempts resulted in a pushback and the death of their daughter, six year old Madina Hussiny — a pushback that is still denied by Croatian authorities in spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary\.

AYS also checked the information for another family \(A\. \), whom we met last Thursday \(March 15\) at the border, after we got the information that they are in Croatia, that they want to seek asylum and that they need urgent medical help\.

After contacting the police and the ER, our volunteers came to the spot and witnessed a possible push\-back attempt of the family\. Immediately, AYS volunteers called the ambulance that intervened soon and the two girls from the group were taken to the hospital in Vinkovci, accompanied by the police and AYS volunteers\. It turned out that one of the girls has a serious health condition and requires medical treatment and operation\.

However, as stated in the medical document, the copy of which is in the possession of AYS, “the patient has refused to be hospitalized, since she is going to Zagreb with her family in order to regulate her status as asylum seeker in Croatia”\. We were sure that we will soon see the family in Porin, as we got the information that the rest of the family has expressed the intention to seek asylum at the border police station\.


> Yet, today we got the confirmation by the Tovarnik transit staff that they are still accommodated there, even after seven days from the expression of the intention to seek asylum and despite the medical urgency for one of the family members\. We wrote to the Head of Croatian police, MoI Department for Asylum, and the Border police, as well as to the Ombudspersons and UNHCR, asking for the reasons of this detention\. 




This is another link the chain of ongoing systematic disregard for international humanitarian law and practice\. As AYS and CMS continue to report, pushbacks are a regular occurrence, yet there is a continued effort to suppress reports of this, with government officials first denying, theorizing that asylum seekers have made up the story, and occasionally admitting that such incidents do occur, but are not official policy\.

Additionally, arbitrary and unlawful practices by the Ministry of the Interior and the Security and Intelligence Agency were brought to light as dozens of people saw their asylum claims dismissed on the basis of being considered a threat to Croatia\. The individuals remain barred from being able to see the grounds upon which they are labelled a threat \(many of these individuals being women and children and the elderly\) \. As a result, unease and a mistrust of the Croatian Asylum System is pervasive\. With this backdrop, is it any wonder that people drop out of the system and chance safer pastures elsewhere? Hope dies last, but when faith in an institution is destroyed, it is nearly irreparable\.

The most perverse twist of this is that people are then punished and demonized once again for resorting to alternate methods of securing their safety\. How many times have we heard “well if they only came _legally_ or via _procedure_ — why don’t they need to use these shady ways?” In short, by making the procedure nearly inaccessible and completely dysfunctional, the state can engage in violence and intimidation against people on the move without getting its hands dirty\.

People then abandoning the system that’s against them is in turn used to justify further stigma and demonization of people who are simply desperate to live a normal life\.

This demonization helps to normalize and dismiss conversations like the below\. These messages were received by a juvenile Iraqi with refugee status in Croatia; he had been previously attacked by a group of youths and had to be rescued by his father and brother\. Although the incident is reported, and most people would agree that this kind of hate is exceptionally bad, many “good normal” citizens will simply dismiss these kinds of attacks as fringe and go about their day\.

We must address discrimination and systematic oppression of refugees on every level of our societies, whether it is at the institutional level where they are being slowly but surely pushed into harms way through bureaucratic negligence or at the personal level, over a cup of coffee with one’s friend who “just doesn’t understand why they don’t come normally\.” All of these forms are interconnected and are forms of violence\.
### TURKEY

A [recent report](https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/03/22/turkey-mass-deportations-syrians) from Human Rights Watch reveals that Turkish Security Forces have intercepted thousands of Syrian refugees and prevented them from entering Turkey and claiming asylum\. Moreover, these refugees were returned forcibly to Idlib\.

“Turkish border guards have shot at asylum seekers trying to enter Turkey using smuggling routes, killing and wounding them, and have deported to Idlib newly arrived Syrians in the Turkish town of Antakya, 30 kilometers from the Syrian border\.

The Russian\-Syrian military alliance’s December offensive against anti\-government forces in Idlib has displaced [almost 400,000](https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/latest_developments_in_north-western_syria_20180313_final.pdf) civilians, according to the UN\. They have joined more than 1\.3 million others trapped inside Idlib in insecure, overcrowded camps, and in makeshift camps in fields near the closed Turkish border where they are under constant threat of attack and lack food, clean water, shelter, health care, and aid\.”

In the wake of the siege and fall of Afrin, an estimated 100,000 people have fled\. Additionally, Turkey recently came under [criticism from the UN](http://theregion.org/article/13084-un-report-details-violations-of-human-rights-against-kurds-in-southeast-turkey) which published a report on systematic oppression of Kurds inside of Turkey\. In the aftermath of the attempted coup against Erdogan in 2016, many people have disappeared, been dismissed from their positions in work and in one year along, over 700 buildings in Suriçi have been razed\.

_“Credible NGO sources indicate that in the first quarter of 2017, the total number of violations in South\-East Turkey amounted to 7,907 and included 263 incidents of torture in detention, the report said\.”_

It remains unclear what consequences Europe’s “Ally” in refugee hosting will face after these report\.
### GREECE


_Lesvos_

A 26\-year\-old Syrian man in Moria attempted to self\-immolate yesterday\. Although he was not successful, he suffered severe burns and is currently in the hospital\. The horrors of those stranded in Greece seem to mount higher and higher\.

No Border Kitchen Lesvos notes that another rash of arbitrary arrests as well as a pre\-trial hearing for those arrested have come about after the peaceful protests on March 14th \(protests that were disrupted by police tear gas\) \. The individuals arrested have not been given access to a lawyer and are charged with attempted murder for setting bins on fire, perplexingly, on March the 12th\. Several of those arrested were not even present in the camp during the time at which the events in question took place\.

The office of the Afghan Community of Migrants and Refugees in Greece was subjected to an arson attack on the 22nd around 1pm\. There will be a press conference today at 12 noon regarding the incident which, thankfully, resulted in no casualties, but did result in serious damage\. The widely\-denounced attack was committed by the Nazi organization **Crypteia,** which would seem to be named after the ancient Spartan institution designed to train young men for battle\.
### MALTA

The Ministry of European Affairs and Equality \(MEAE\) announced at a recent press conference the implementation of a 2 million euro grant aimed at promoting a proactive approach to integration\. The press release, which occurred at a joint conference between the MEAE and the Ministry of Home Affairs and National Security, also detailed the Maltese’s governments acknowledgement of the diversity of push factors involving people arriving in Europe which include not only war, but also economic factors and global climate change\. In an encouraging note, the statement also included a commitment to a proactive \(as opposed to a reactive\) approach to integration, centering full support and specifically highlighting the need for psycho\-social support for incoming people\. Additionally, this was placed in the context of the continuing trend of European attitudes which is manifesting a rightward and xenophobic swing; therefore the efforts to integrate and \(may we highlight\) fully support newly arrived people is part of an approach to combat and counter this\.

### PORTUGAL

In an article in Portuguese media, it is noted how the ineffective, irregular, and slothful asylum and reception system in Portugal continues to drive people out from the system, in search of security\.

“The speed with which, two years ago, organizations volunteered to welcome refugees stands in stark contrast with the length of procedures, for example, the regularization of the resident status or family reunification\.
People who came fleeing persecution return to their countries or leave Portugal\. This is because ‘the Portuguese refugee reception system works in a miserable way,’ [says Francesco Vacchiano](https://www.publico.pt/2018/03/22/politica/noticia/be-aponta-criticas-que-sao-erros-do-governo-no-acolhimento-dos-refugiados-1807574) \. ‘It does not work to provide people with citizenship rights\. The system does not take into account that people do not just want to live, they want to live a dignified life’, he emphasizes\.”

This is a pattern seen across Europe and is one that has been warned about by activists and volunteers alike for years now\. However, governments continue to DENY the reality of migration and the need to welcome humans fleeing dire situations and, instead, drag their feet, giving people no other choice\.
### SPAIN

“Volunteers and volunteers of proactive open arms call for demonstrations in front of the European Union offices in Spain\.

The Open Arms ship has been immobilized in pozzallo \(Sicily\) since Sunday, 18 March, under a research process led by the catania prosecutor’s office, which considers the organization as a criminal organization promoting illegal immigration”

A Solidarity statement for Nour was posted in volunteer groups for Paris and other locations


> “To the memory of Nour and to denounce the failure to take care of unaccompanied minors in Paris An isolated minor supported by the office of Social Assistance to Children \(ASE\) Paris died due to the lack of appropriate follow\-up Call for the rally Wednesday, 21 March, at 18 p\.m\. City Hall Square He is Malik Nurulain but preferred to call him Nour\. Nour died on 14 February 2018, found drowned in the seine in Paris\. He was 17 years old\. As a victim of torture, he had fled Pakistan at the age of 15\. 





> In France for a year, under the responsibility of Social Assistance to Children \(ASE\) in Paris, he had recently benefited from subsidiary protection granted by the french office for the protection of refugees and stateless persons\. For the past five months, he has been staying alone at the hotel without adequate supervision and in great mental distress\. He had already been taken over twice in a psychiatric hospital before the ASE decided to put him in the hotel because he had no place in a home\. A few months after his placement at the hotel, he was saved from a first attempt at suicide in the Seine and supported for the third time in a psychiatric hospital\. 





> When he got out, he was once again relocated to the hotel, alone to confront of his trauma\. His lifeless body was fished seven days after he left the hospital\. The legal officer of this unaccompanied minor, ASE, had maintained him at the hotel in an environment that is clearly inadequate to ensure his protection and despite the proven risks of suicide and repeated reports of his community \(friends, associations, ad hoc administrator\) \) As a result, we denounce the inaction of the ASE in Paris which, in our view, showing no assistance to anyone at risk\. 





> … Like many other exiles, Nour risked her life to seek protection from France\. It was not the exile that killed him, but the failure of the care system for unaccompanied minors in Paris\.” 




### GERMANY

The coalition government in Germany is planning to go ahead with a plan for managing refugees and asylum seekers that is set to fail, in direct contravention to common knowledge about integration and successful support\. The CDU\-SPD coalition seeks to replace the current system and implement “all in one” centers where asylum seekers will have to submit their application and wait \(for up to 18 months\) on their protection decision\. According to the plan, families with children will be allowed to leave after 6 months\. Additionally, those who receive status will be allowed to leave, but it remains to be decided how\.

_“Catarina Lobenstein, writing in Die Zeit, says the proposed asylum centers represent a switch from a policy of decentralized accommodation to one of mass concentration camps\. According to Lobenstein, those working in similar centers that already exist in the Bavarian cities of Bamberg and Manching — potential models for the coalition’s planned centers — have long complained about the conditions there\._

_Lobenstein also suggests that such centers are a recipe for failed integration\. Studies have shown that contact with German\-speakers, the ability to work and to send children to regular school are the best ways to ensure integration and wellbeing among asylum seekers\.”_

### FINLAND

A recent study of shift in acceptance rates of Iraqi refugees between the ages of 17 and 34 found that there was no corresponding legislative change to account for the drop in acceptance\. Rather, increased suspicion and stricter vetting based off of this suspicion accounts for the majority of these cases\.

“Nea Oljakka of Turku University noted that human rights violations were much the same in 2015 and 2017\.

“ ‘Applicants cited torture, kidnapping and other kinds of violence\. In 2015 it was still believed that these kinds of abuses were an indication that there was a danger that \[they\] could also face similar threats in the future,’ she commented\.

By 2017, immigration officials no longer held that view, researchers said\. Migri officials also evaluated applicant’s fears\. In 2017, they were viewed as unwarranted unless applicants could outline in detail who the threat came from, as well as why and how the rights abuses constituted persecution\. In effect, in 2017, applicants were required to provide more detailed evidence of persecution than before\.”

However in spite of knowledge of this ambiguous increase in stricter vetting, there was no provided metric, meaning that the system remains unclear and relies primarily on a lack of transparency rather than concrete, documented legislation\. This is a serious issue as official rely more and more on “gut instincts” and ambiguity in the law to justify their decision to reject someone, potentially sending them back into dangerous situations\.
