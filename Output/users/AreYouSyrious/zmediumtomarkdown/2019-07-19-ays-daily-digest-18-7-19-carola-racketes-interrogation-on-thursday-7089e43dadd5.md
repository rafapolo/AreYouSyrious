> > #CarolaRackete arrived a few minutes ago at the public prosecutor’s office here in #Agrigento. Prosecutors will question her as part of an ongoing investigation linked to a different proceeding in relation to charges for people smuggling. #SeaWatch3 https://t.co/s226mr5dfo

Carola remains under investigation and faces up to 15 years in prison\. OHCHR continues to express concern over her trial and the larger effect on the public perception of sea rescue\.


> “This prosecution could have a chilling effect on migrant rights defenders and on civil society as a whole” — Michel Forst, Special Rapporteur on human rights defenders 





This can already be seen in the mistreatment and disrespect towards the judge who released Carola from house arrest\.


> “Ideological political accusations made against a judge by authorities of the executive simply for fulfilling a well\-established norm of public international law establishing a duty to rescue persons in distress at sea **constitute a serious breach of the principles of judicial independence** and the separation of powers\. 





> The duty to respect and abide by the judgments and decisions of the judiciary constitutes a necessary corollary of the principle of separation of powers,” — Diego García\-Sayán, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers 





In commenting on her interrogation on Thursday, [Sea Watch](https://twitter.com/SeaWatchItaly/status/1151801143565201409?fbclid=IwAR3_vNhPwh3owS7YeztN6S1bZK3AOSgJahr2H6SsizUGXM2cZjKWCaPMODw) tweeted:
#### “Our Captian is serene and will explain to investigators how she has fulfilled her duty to rescue those found at sea and \(was\) left to it by the whole of Europe\.”

### Libya

MSF, like others continues to note that **the Tajoura detention center** cannot remotely constitute a humane living situation due to the violence and complete disregard of human rights through Libya’s lawlessness\.

After the horrific airstrike on 2 [July](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/libya-immigrants-detention-tajoura-centre-jeremy-hunt-airstrike-a9010821.html) , it’s estimated that 60 people were killed and 70 people were injured\. Doctors described the scene with bodies everywhere, _“and body parts sticking out from under the rubble\.”_ It was a scene that must have haunted the 90 people who were intercepted in the Mediterranean last week, and forced to return to Tajoura\.

MSF reiterates that the cycle of violence to people living in Libyan detention centers doesn’t just need condemnation, it needs action\. Europe needs to stop supporting and working alongside Libya\.


■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 
> **[MSF Sea](https://twitter.com/MSF_Sea) @ Twitter Says:** 

> > #MSF calls, once again, for the immediate closure of #Tajoura detention centre and the evacuation of all detained refugees and migrants out of Libya. The forced return of people fleeing #Libya must stop, the cycle must be broken.

### Sea

[Mediterranea Saving Humans](https://mediterranearescue.org/news/sul-web-ce-una-macchina-organizzata-per-boicottare-il-soccorso-in-mare-denuncia-di-mediterranea-alla-polizia-postale-mentre-riparte-la-raccolta-fondi/) warns of a recent cyber attack their campaign experienced on their website:


> “The IPs of the computers from which the cyber attack started which, on 9 July, sabotaged our site for more than two hours were all from the Moscow area\. This act of piracy and the many reports, which started within a few minutes, which suspended the fundraising promoted via Facebook for a week, show the existence of an organized network, with considerable resources and probably coverage by institutional apparatus, **which intervenes on command to strike solidarity and rescue operations at sea on the Internet** \.” 





They are currently back online\. If there was ever a time to support sea rescue, it’s now\.
