### The systematic use of pushbacks at Greek borders

It has been reported time and time again that the Greek Hellenic Coast Guard, the police, the border guards, the army, and FRONTEX have all taken part in the illegal practice of refoulement\.

There are many ways in which refoulement takes place, for instance, an individual who has reached the mainland may be detained in an old warehouse, police or army vehicle until the night when the refoulemount is planned to take place\. They are usually detained in awful conditions, and are often not provided with any food, water, or medicine\.

As reported across many news outlets, the practice of refoulement has been extended to the Aegean sea in the form of ‘pushbacks’\.


> “In the 89 incidents of illegal pushbacks, affecting approximately 4,500 persons, recorded by the Border Violence Monitoring Network in the 2020 Annual Torture Report, almost 90% involved serious mistreatment and torture, while 52% of the victims were minors\.” 





The systematic use of pushbacks suggest it is the preferred method of refoulement on the Greek/Turkish border\.


[![]()](https://www.scienceopen.com/hosted-document?doi=10.13169/statecrime.10.2.0238)


AYS, among several other organisations, have regularly reported on pushbacks\. There have been several pushbacks reported on the Greek coast this last week\. For instance, [The Aegean Boat Report](https://aegeanboatreport.com/2022/08/20/just-another-pushback/?fbclid=IwAR2YevtxogYC5_Nz5L3ac7Kb1R61p8kzJkRPN4ROYO3BwKvznB8ApWuZmG0) wrote of a group of nine individuals who reached Leros on 15th August, and were in hiding\. Contact was lost before any assistance was provided, and on 16th August a boat was found drifting in the Aegean\. The Turkish authorities rescued the boat, and the Aegean Boat Report has identified this was the same group who had reached Leros and were pushed back\.

This follows another pushback that took place on 14th August, when a boat with 46 people on board was found drifting off the coast of Cesme, Turkey, after being pushed back from Chios\.

■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 


And another pushback that look place in Lesvos where a group of 19 people, including eight children, arrived on Lesvos in the early hours of 12th August\. They went into hiding, and contacted the Aegean Boat Report\. However, they lost contact with them before they could reach them, and that afternoon, the group were found drifting on a life raft off the coast of Dikili, Turkey\.

Protests have been taking place across Athens in response to the reports of pushbacks and the inhumane treatment of refugees and asylum seekers in Greece\.

It is also very important to note pushbacks are not unique to Greece\. This illegal practice is taking place along borders in many other EU countries, such as, [Lithuania](https://t.co/VHnBa5R6on) , [Latvia](https://twitter.com/ecre/status/1558045928682029058) , [Croatia](https://twitter.com/LHreports/status/1445814415446581259) , and others\.
#### POLAND
### Report reflecting on the last year at the Polish\-Belarusian border


> The crisis on the Polish\-Belarusian border has revealed not only that Poland has no migration policy, and the migration policy of the entire European community is inadequate to the migration challenges posed by the modern world\. 





Large, international organisations stated they were not able to enter the border zone without an invitation from the Polish government\. Other organisations didn’t seem to make enough effort to fight the political obstacles that prevented them from entering the border zone\.

Ruhi Akhtar, from Refugee Biryani and Bananas, posted on Facebook about this case\.


> From this boat arrival some people made it to quarantine\. Eight others were pushed back, three of whom died, reported to have been handcuffed and thrown into the sea during a pushback to Turkey\. One of the boys who was pushed back solemnly recounted this incident and how he watched his friends drown\.

#### MOROCCO
### As many as 52% of individuals from migrant backgrounds in Morocco do not have access to the COVID\-19 vaccine


> Out of that percentage, 70% refused to get vaccinated while the remaining 30% wanted a vaccine but couldn’t obtain it, a survey carried out by the International Organization for Migration in Morocco shows\. 





Out of those who refuse the vaccine, the reasons can vary from not having enough information on the vaccine to being scared of the side effects\.

The IOM conducted this research in order to boost their awareness campaigns and better understand the views of migrant groups towards getting vaccinated\.

As part of the Dublin Regulation, another 1826 individuals were deported back to the first EU country in which they had claimed asylum\.

It has become apparent that the Government have been using ‘mini\-charter flights’:


> The left\-wing faction, meanwhile, sharply criticized the practice of so\-called ‘mini charter flights’, which refer to deportation flights with no more than four persons who are obliged to leave\.

#### NETHERLANDS
### The Dutch reception process has been heavily criticised as asylum seekers have been left out on the street at Ter Apel, the main reception facility, for months\.

It was closed last week due to a fight breaking out, but the Red Cross has now reopened the facility\. This last weekend, around 300 people have been forced to sleep outside the centre\.

> “In the Netherlands we don’t have a refugee crisis\. There is a political crisis that has resulted in people in Ter Apel sleeping outside\.” — Martijn Van der Linden, Refugee Council spokesperson 





The Council is calling for improved access to clean water, adequate food and healthcare, privacy, and showers\.
#### UK
### The Home Office is concerned about young asylum seekers lying about their age

52 individuals who entered the UK irregularly over the last 10 years have succeeded in registering as underage when in fact they were aged 30 or older\.

Around 1500 individuals attempted to claim they were underage, but this claim did not often pass the initial assessments\. The rate at which individuals try to falsely claim to be underage has risen exponentially in the last few years\. This is partly due to the fact the UK government has been tightening their migration policies, creating greater desperation among those arriving\.


> According to UK legislation, migrants whose appearance qualifies as 25 years of age or younger are to be treated as children under the law — unless it is proved otherwise\. However, testing methods to deliberate the age of migrants are limited, with many false claimants falling through the cracks in the system\. 





The idea of running medical tests has been put forward in the past, such as conducting X\-rays to look at an individual’s bone structure\. However, human rights organisations have raised concerns of the ethics of such testing\.
