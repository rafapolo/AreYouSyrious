**Woman Dies in Melilla Shelter, Morocco Loosens Border Controls**

The tiny Spanish enclave of Melilla is currently hosting countless stranded people in homeless shelters and camps\. One of those people was a 34\-year\-old Moroccan woman [who was found dead](https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2020/05/302657/moroccan-woman-dies-in-melilla-homeless-shelter/?fbclid=IwAR0ZEN6lwxx5p2butW2VZFZwYv-v9KeQ9Jk6q8lygyUEtrbFaymUq0CCmNc) in a homeless shelter, bleeding from her nose and ears\. Authorities suspect a heart attack, but are still investigating\.

The woman was stranded in Melilla after her employers fired her, and could not return to Morocco because it closed all of its borders abruptly due to the pandemic, even to citizens\. This has trapped thousands of Moroccan citizens abroad, but they are not the only ones affected\. Countless people on the move find themselves stranded in the Spanish enclaves bordering Moroccan territory— they cannot go back to Morocco, and Spain refuses to transfer them to mainland Europe\.

Early on Friday morning, the Moroccan government [announced it would reopen](https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2020/05/302671/morocco-to-repatriate-500-citizens-from-melilla/) its borders and work with the Spanish government to repatriate 500 of its citizens that are currently stranded in Melilla, hopefully preventing another death like this one\. However, NGOs like [No Name Kitchen](https://twitter.com/NoNameKitchen1/status/1261307819510374402) are afraid that the Spanish government might use the border reopening as an opportunity to conduct illegal pushbacks of people trying to reach Europe\. There are many people who are not Moroccan but are [caught in legal limbo](https://twitter.com/SolidaryW/status/1261262747452542977) in Melilla because there are deportation orders against them, but they were not able to exercise their right to appeal due to the pandemic\. Unfortunately, the Spanish government could deport them on a technicality even if their legal battle is not over yet\.

We want to take this opportunity to remind our readers about the conditions people stuck in Melilla are living in, as we reported in our [last digest](ays-daily-digest-15-05-20-another-death-related-to-the-official-camps-in-bosnia-and-herzegovina-e3f72a3222d) \. People are forced to live in tents that flood every time it rains, soaking all of their possessions, don’t have enough food, and cannot leave the camp even when they need to be hospitalized\. The organization Coordinadora de Barrios has [filed a report](https://cadenaser.com/ser/2020/05/14/sociedad/1589456148_085543.html?fbclid=IwAR3Kysng6F9rXfSiIeec82HuaD1Z3Zo9eYN6OHCZWp3ZPxMBBWXNafYzrqI) with the office of the State Attorney General, asking them to investigate and protect the rights of children and vulnerable people trapped in these conditions\.

It is good that Morocco is reopening its borders, but it is horrible that the reopening could be used for nefarious purposes and that it took a tragic death for that to happen\. We do not know about the conditions in the shelter the woman was living in or the details surrounding her death, but it is possible that the stress of the conditions she was living in contributed to her heart attack\. It is too late to do anything for this woman besides offer condolences to her family, but it is still possible to improve living conditions in Melilla and allow people to get to where they want to go\. Preferably before anybody else dies\.

SEA
### Malta Replacing Captain Morgan Boat With…Bigger Captain Morgan Boat

The Maltese government [is sending out](https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/larger-captain-morgan-ferry-deployed-for-rescued-migrants.792263?fbclid=IwAR3u10W6r9RUHv-Oyv5a-e6X-kdp-4uVi3ixBXOBvi3jz1sCsy4lIKDjIrg) a third Captain Morgan day cruising ship to replenish supplies and to serve as an offshore holding center for people on the move\. It is relieving another boat owned by the same rum company which is smaller and even less suited to holding 110 people on board\.

Just a reminder that each one of these vessels is costing the Maltese government 3,000 euros per day\. It is still choosing to detain people on ships that are not designed to hold this many people overnight, let alone for days on end, instead of letting them land \(the fact that it is choosing ships named after a rum brand’s mascot adds to the indignity and absurdity of the situation\) \.

AlarmPhone [reported](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1261246748464484357) on another boat full of people on the move in the Maltese SAR, but they were not notified of any rescue operation\. It is unclear what happened to that ship and its passengers\.

For a roundup of the recent situation in the Mediterranean, who has been allowed to dock and who is still stranded at sea, read this [report](https://www.ecre.org/med-78-to-quarantine-on-italian-ship-163-still-stranded-amid-spike-in-departures-and-depleted-rescue-capacities/?fbclid=IwAR0bhHOQF5dzOGZ6ZCv8TSFb9gZjVVryC1m19g3gocZT38zfywKJCtSt8V8) \.

GREECE
### Turkish Man, Victim of an Illegal Pushback, Now in Jail

A Turkish man who [tried to claim asylum](https://twitter.com/VassilisTsarnas/status/1261286410029617152?fbclid=IwAR2izYMasaniNkdWxtfTpwyLWrVY5BZFK3cdXv4tewBAdE4W6gAqMqONYtQ) in Greece a few weeks ago has been imprisoned in Turkey\.

The man landed at Symi on May 6th\. The local authorities are trying to deny that any group of people on the move landed on Symi recently\. However, the man was in contact with a Turkish woman living locally via Whatsapp\. He even shared an ID photo and his location with her so she could put him in touch with a lawyer to begin preparing his asylum application\. They eventually lost contact and when the lawyer contacted the local authorities, they said there was no landing\. It is possible that he was pushed back in one of the life rafts that have been found near Symi in the past, although we do not know any details about his journey\.

A few days later, the man [was convicted](https://www.vice.com/gr/article/wxqqzx/h-istoria-toy-toyrkoy-fyga-poy-feretai-na-perase-sth-symh-kai-bre8hke-pisw-sth-fylakh) in a Turkish court of involvement in the 2016 coup and accused of being a Gulenist\. He denies all the accusations and says he was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time\. He had already been in jail, in 2016, and a Turkish journalist living abroad had published a letter from him proclaiming his innocence\. The man had a clear case for asylum, if only he had been allowed to apply\.

Greece’s asylum service [will reopen](https://www.ekathimerini.com/252733/article/ekathimerini/news/asylum-service-reopens-on-may-18-residence-permits-extended-by-six-months?fbclid=IwAR03LgrGB1amCGzEjrF4X9xfCykZ6KbAsTPEd-bjEDqdiTVxBCCHA30WfIA) on May 18th, although only half the staff will go back to work\. All residence permits were extended by 6 months to avoid an influx of applicants that would flood the system\. Although the asylum service has been closed for over two months, they did [not make any preparations](https://twitter.com/rspaegean/status/1261378733723836419?fbclid=IwAR1VfkH7kZsAyn7GmXnHOAV8rJyGw7Jw4wysiGCF5yvta4Hf-N2YLYypjBU) for the influx of requests they are going to get, so the next few months are probably going to be chaotic \(well, more chaotic than usual\) \.

Stand by me Lesvos [reported](https://www.facebook.com/www.standbymelesvos.gr/posts/632296434030049?hc_location=ufi) that a total of four people living in Megalo Therma on Lesvos tested positive for covid\-19\. Hopefully, they will be able to get better and the virus will not spread, but given the conditions in Greek camps that is not likely\. Most asylum seekers in Greece [do not have access](https://twitter.com/rspaegean/status/1261382107169017863) to healthcare, even if they have the right paperwork, because of technical issues\.

Human Rights 360 published [a report](https://www.humanrights360.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/During-After-Crisis-Evros.pdf?fbclid=IwAR0VBn1UhKZufrdpqXMLwf_kCKd2fvvREfv3NWXrj2r8ClWyBCxrdDA2WcY) on the Evros border crisis, summarizing what led to the crisis, the illegal pushbacks and restrictive measures adopted in reaction to the crisis, and the current situation\. Interestingly, the report talked about a temporary camp that the Greek government built at Kleidi of Serres, a small town near the Bulgarian border, that almost caused an international incident\. The Bulgarian Foreign Minister posted on his Facebook page that housing people so close to the border was causing tension and that Bulgaria was ready to defend its borders by any means necessary\. Unfortunately, this xenophobic, violent rhetoric is not unique to Bulgaria but seems to characterize EU policy as a whole\.

Two men from Afghanistan will receive jail terms and fines of over a thousand euros for [allegedly participating](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/24789/greece-two-afghan-migrants-receive-jail-terms-following-riots?fbclid=IwAR1JdxmrwaJ7itng7wzV7UiGQQ6ACAeSQ6Tm4YDrkYSlm4FKTPOq0eds4EI) in a riot that took place in a camp in northern Greece\. The media is not sure what camp the incident took place in, as the government is not being specific and there are several in the region\. The one near Thessaloniki in particular is notorious for being “unsuitable for detention,” according to the Greek Council for Refugees\. Protests have been breaking out all over Greece recently against unsanitary conditions, prolonged detention, and illegal detention of children\. People on the move, even potentially innocent ones, are thrown into jail for damaging property, but who will face jail time for creating these living conditions that get people sick and kill them?

ITALY
### Stricter Measures on Northeastern Border

After reports that arrivals were increasing rapidly from Slovenia to Italy, the interior ministry said it would take “ [urgent, immediate action](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/24784/measures-against-migrant-arrivals-in-northeast-italy?fbclid=IwAR3lOxWWmkh-j40laEOdmLfl8KJ6vs5S-1gmqE8wFf6gSkR2-bW_a_yq0xk) ,” according to the government of the Friuli\-Venezia\-Giulia region\.

The police union warned that numbers of arrivals are increasing rapidly, stretching the police force beyond its capacity\. They also said that finding protective equipment and maintaining social distancing and quarantine is difficult in these crowded conditions\.

The Italians promised they would work with Slovenia to increase Schengen border surveillance\. Unfortunately, this means there will probably be more violence along this border in the future\.
