#### FEATURED

German minister Seehofer met with his colleagues from France, Spain, Great Britain, Italy and Poland, and proposed to shift the decisions on asylum applications to the external borders of the EU, so as to reduce the number of incoming refugees, reports [_Die Zeit_](https://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2019-10/horst-seehofer-spd-asyl-pruefung-eu-aussengrenze-moeglich?utm_content=zeitde_redpost+_link_sf&utm_source=twitter_zonaudev_int&utm_medium=sm&wt_zmc=sm.int.zonaudev.twitter.ref.zeitde.redpost.link.sf&utm_campaign=ref) \. He reportedly aims to prepare a draft proposal to replace Dublin when Germany assumes the rotating EU Presidency in the second half of 2020\. He proposes “that asylum seekers rejected in EU countries to be repatriated” to the external borders of EU\.
Interestingly, Greece didn’t take part at the meeting\.

So far, it seems his other counterparts backed the new proposition according to which asylum seekers with the prospect of being recognized as refugees will then be relocated to those EU member states willing to accept them\. There, at a second stage of the procedure, the asylum application will be finally decided\.

In such a version, criticized by ProAsyl, a number of questions remain unanswered — what happens to those who first appear in one of the ‘inner’ countries, regardless of means, but particularly those arriving in EU countries by airplane? Also, what will happen to asylum\-seekers who concluded the first stage of procedures but no EU member state wants them? 
And also, what happens to people’s right to choose?

We will report on this as things develop further\.
#### LIBYA

According to the recent official statements, the EU will continue training Libyan Coast Guard forces to improve their efficiency and ability to manage search and rescue operations in Libyan territorial waters\.

“The EU insists on rejecting violence and respecting international laws and humanitarian standards while rescuing migrants,” said their spokesperson\.

The past months several reports on the abuse of migrants and refugees in Libya have been published\. One more dreadful than the other\. The UN has been accused of being partly guilty of it, as they fail to admit that they cannot handle the situation\. On Tuesday heavy gunfire broke out in the capital, Tripoli, which lead to the release of hundreds of migrants from Abu Salim detention center\. Both UNHCR and other witnesses confirmed the information, Reuters [said](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-libya/migrants-released-amid-fighting-in-libyan-capital-seek-refuge-with-u-n-idUSKBN1X82MK?fbclid=IwAR0sxXSwvKjZ41x0Kpy0iYCWoe-RpJUi6Nu2l7xDz8AcYbmBtDCXcMnkN6A) \.

It was reported that a few hundred people released from the detention center made their way towards the UNHCR resettlement center in Tripoli, the GDF\. The UN\-center has been heavily overcrowded, and the situation there is not according to the standard it should be\. People have in fact also been trying to [escape the GDF\.](https://twitter.com/sallyhayd/status/1188846230790688771/photo/1) Also, the number of places in the UNHCR’s GDF\-center strangely continues to drop, as noted by journalist Sara Creta:

Journalist Sally Hayden, who’s in direct contact with several refugees and migrants, published this thread with more information on the conditions in Abu Salim\. She wrote that people had walked out of the detention center after the Libyan guards tried to lock them up by force\. Since the beginning of the year they have been able to move around, a bit, in exchange for being given food:

Meanwhile, UN’s Charlie Yaxley said on Twitter that:

#### SEARCH AND RESCUE AT SEA

France, Germany, Italy, and Malta reached a deal in Valletta, on Malta on 23 September to try to avoid rescue ships being held up for weeks while countries decided their fate on a case\-by\-case basis\. In line with that decision, the people rescued by the SAR crews of Ocean Viking and Alan Kurdi will be taken in by France, Germany, and Italy, it is [reported](https://www.france24.com/en/20191029-paris-berlin-and-rome-to-take-194-migrants-rescued-from-med?fbclid=IwAR1u3pVpX6EETHiCxc71s16r-wfWW349v0K4Bs6POGqyxSNuiWWRZckV-D4) \.
#### GREECE

#### Constant threat of eviction

NoBorders posted a video from Exarchia, where the police and military presence is a constant reminder nowadays of potential evictions\.

Fortunately, there is still resistance\. Photographer Nicolas Koutsokostas is reporting on a pro\-refugee march in central Athens\. The new asylum bill, which will further marginalize people on the move in and through Greece, was the reason for the protest\.

### Islands
#### 35,097 people stuck now

The Greek government today released [new numbers](https://infocrisis.gov.gr/6634/national-situational-picture-regarding-the-islands-at-eastern-aegean-sea-29-10-2019/?lang=en&fbclid=IwAR15AdWArt8gS2LHbEK8x-l9TAownIARPl-zG2Zfz3Jcs5n58SmDSm7Icow) for the islands\. They said that 35,097 people now live on the Greek islands, which is far more than there have been since 2015 and 2016\. Even if the authorities move 10,000 people off the islands as they announced they would before, it is very likely that they will fill up again before the winter months\.

Only between Tuesday and Wednesday 596 people arrived, according to Aegean Boat report\. Thirteen boats in total landed on the islands, find more details [here\.](https://www.facebook.com/AegeanBoatReport/posts/683891198800654?hc_location=ufi)
