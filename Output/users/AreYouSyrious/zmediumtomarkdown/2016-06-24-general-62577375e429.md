### **214,691 arrivals by sea in 2016**

[News that Moves](https://newsthatmoves.org/en/almost-four-times-more-arrivals-in-europe-by-sea-in-2016/) reports that the International Organization for Migration \(IOM\) says 214,691 migrants and refugees entered Europe by sea in 2016, compared to 59,000 last year during the same period\.

Greece received over 157,000, while Italy saw more than 55,000 refugees arrive\. 1,352 asylum\-seekers reached Spain and 28 landed on Cyprus\.

An additional 1,020 lives have been lost at sea this year compared to last year\. Total deaths so far this year total 2,861 compared with 1,838 through the first six months of 2015\. This means one in every 20 people who crossed since the beginning of the year have died in the sea between Libya and Italy\.

IOM Libya also reports 153 fatalities were confirmed by Libya’s coast guard, which has recovered the remains of dozens of drowned men, women and at least one child, mostly from Sub\-Saharan African countries\.
### **441,800 asylum applications received by Germany in 2015**

In an analysis of Eurostat data for 2015, the Centre for European Policy Studies says Germany received 441,800 applications, out of a total of 1\.2 million, making them the biggest receiving State\. Hungary received 174,435 and Sweden a total of 156,110\.

In the EU as a whole, the top four countries of asylum applicants were Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran\. 98% of Syrians were granted protection status in the first instance between October and December 2015, Eritreans 93% and Iraqis 80%\.

### Dancer’s suicide highlights misery of Syrian refugees in Lebanon

[Voa](http://m.voanews.com/a/dancers-suicide-highlights-misery-of-syrian-refugees-in-lebanon/3389352.html) reports on the suicide of a famous Syrian refugee dancer —the author says these acts of despair are increasingly prevalent among refugees living in Lebanon\. The article states that many refugees face resentment and discrimination over Syria’s role in Lebanon’s 15\-year civil war and are living in constant fear of deportation — a 2014 UN Population Fund [study](http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/YSA-SyriaCrisis-FullReport.pdf) found that 41% of Syrian refugee youth have considered suicide as an option to the hardships they face as refugees in Lebanon\.

### Syrian teenager shot trying to return from Greece to Turkey

Greek police say a teenage Syrian refugee has been injured after being shot by an unknown man while trying to illegally return to Turkey, from which he had entered Greece months earlier\.

The 16\-year\-old, together with a 21\-year\-old Iraqi, had bought a small inflatable dinghy in which they planned to cross the Evros river, on Greece’s northeastern border with Turkey\.

Police say both men were threatened Thursday by two men in a boat from the Turkish side, who fired at them with a shotgun as they ran away\.
### Turkish entrepreneur helps Syrian refugees

In a bit of good news, [UNHCR](http://www.unhcr.org/news/stories/2016/6/576aa2104/the-man-who-changes-lives.html) reports on Levent Topçu and his association, who has renovated an abandoning building, making it suitable for several families to live in\. He also provided them with food but most importantly, helped them get work permits and employs them inn his factory, paying them the same wages as their Turkish counterparts\.

### Riot in Skaramangas

A riot erupted in Skaramangas camp, resulting in several injuries, including two men who had to be taken to the hospital\. In addition to injuries, there were many broken doors and windows\.
