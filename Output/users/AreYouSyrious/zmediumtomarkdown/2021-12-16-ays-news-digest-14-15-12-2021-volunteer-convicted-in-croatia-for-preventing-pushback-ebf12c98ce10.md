Dragan Umičević has been convicted in the Croatian courts\. The following statement was issued on the matter\.

Dragan was charged with providing support in seeking asylum to the family of little Madina, a six\-year\-old Afghan girl who died during illegal expulsion from our country\. The European Court of Human Rights has expressly ruled that Croatia severely violated her right to life, her family were exposed to torture, that Croatia denied them access to legal support and international protection, obstructed the investigation into her death, and exposed our activists and lawyers to systematic harassment so that the case would not reach the European Court for Human Rights\.

Dragan is a collateral victim of the pressures described above\. This is a man who acted in accordance with law and morality, and the show trial against him, besides being in direct contravention of the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia and the verdict of the European Court of Human Rights, is a continuation of intimidation that we as a society must not agree to\.

By the verdict of the authorities, he now has to pay a fine of 60,000 kunas \(which is a precedent in our judiciary\) and 1,300 kunas in court costs\. The court knew for certain that Dragan was a retired Croatian Veteran, whose monthly income is 5,000 kunas, and who has no way to cover this enormous amount\. We will not and must not allow Dragan to carry this burden alone\. The AYS Association has already covered all the steep legal costs earlier, and we will also need additional funds to continue the unfortunately expensive legal battles\. Now our priority is to cover Dragan’s fine, and then future legal expenses\.

Please help us with payment to our IBAN HR6824020061100765183 \(for Overseas payments: SWIFT/BIC: ESBCHR22\) \. The account holder is the AYS Association, Erste bank\. In the payment description you can put “for Dragan” or a message of your choice\. Everything we collect will go towards covering the penalty and the further legal battle\. In memory of little Madina, we will direct all possible surplus to directly support her peers who are currently in our country and desperately need our help\.

In solidarity with Dragan, yours AYS\.

An organisation has been [denied NGO status](https://twitter.com/rspaegean/status/1468860469762936835) by the Greek authorities\. Legal advice organisation [RS Aegean](https://rsaegean.org/en/joint-statement-by-19-org-ngo-registry-rejection/) have made a statement about the decision\.

The new, prison\-like, entry gates to Malakasa Camp [have been ‘celebrated’ by authorities\.](https://twitter.com/MigrantsSoli/status/1471074870331064321?fbclid=IwAR0tmA_FrDuuoqLtcnVFlI8pKZgjihXz8cabpGk-Xa7yJknvj36o0RWNn_c)

[This post provides evidence](https://twitter.com/zubeyirkoculu/status/1471155356793556999) for pushbacks from Greece to Turkey [whilst this one details](https://aegeanboatreport.com/2021/12/14/the-shipwreck-of-civilization/?fbclid=IwAR1pbz5Fminj3cMqhI_yTanMxraeO6CG0ZiSQ0WFJ3d2-C-1YCTRGXaz4qE) the daily struggles of new arrivals and those trying to help\.

Meanwhile, editor Far Right tabloid Makelio [was found guilty](https://twitter.com/VassilisTsarnas/status/1471138547549753347?fbclid=IwAR1ipkMuzAE_YGit7OYcvkDnLv2m0rUhopFZsq7GxOmgOxYkhOITvxC1No8) of inciting racism against people from Pakistan\.

[Complaints about conditions and missing donations](https://www.facebook.com/MoriaCoronaAwarenessTeam/posts/213140963648415) have been raised by residents at Kara Tepe camp\. Donations since the fire on Lesbos equate to approximately 500 Euros per person, yet facilities remain lacking\.

These are in addition to protests at Ritsona Camp — details are shared about the [lack of appropriate food](https://twitter.com/parwana_amiri/status/1470717213598527493?fbclid=IwAR3OWn2eqH9V68MqYbRTn7y994_bDiNM8WUsdjmTOqBRb1Bjd6HOSD-OgY0) and the [length of time waiting](https://twitter.com/parwana_amiri/status/1470720071165267976?fbclid=IwAR1T_QyG-cyhhMBgsBFS9jjDVBFDxa_2CsomOZ4aKZePgZm-QcXE-EAXKkY) \.
#### SERBIA

[Publicity around a violent pushback](https://twitter.com/APC_CZA/status/1470413209530159107?fbclid=IwAR0uuWNacmI9zaNvIWAakn6vbfoAdRf0mCkfEoIGVznj1AXQvKqV8xX9eoQ) from Romania to Serbia has included an accusation that Frontex is involved\. The claim is that the Romanian police and army collaborated with Frontex in order to illegally expel people across the border\. This comes as [further reports of violence at the Hungarian border](https://twitter.com/APC_CZA/status/1471135753338036225?fbclid=IwAR2_lwA7iLTIa9U2BO93WoZ0CgugNXLkaps7Zdu8l9wnsW7SC7acfKvojVE) with Serbia included Czech members of Frontex as well as local police\.

The conditions faced by those in Serbia [is shared via a personal story](https://www.facebook.com/NoNameKitchenBelgrade/posts/1379113099153637) of someone living in a tent near the Croatian border\.
#### BELARUS — POLAND
#### Syrian nationals deported, facing danger

[Syrian nationals have been returned to Syria from Belarus](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2021/12/would-be-syrian-refugees-flown-back-belarus-despite-visas?fbclid=IwAR053Ekf7_u_FJm5Detz6UlGiskC9UPL8dz8GwySdYNynEtCKKVw9Y2eCDw#ixzz7F9qnM7bA) , facing danger to their lives\. There were 100 people on the flight and they faced interrogation on their arrival\. The Syrian regime considers people who flee to Europe a threat to the country\.

[A delegation involving Iraqi officials](https://twitter.com/DrAhmedAlSahhaf/status/1470527147148206088?fbclid=IwAR3tpr9ZeTZP6KcBuWth-8A_2xVj2VSutevXFN6EklFCTbBBbrrJFTblVVU) is travelling from Warsaw to the Poland\-German border in order to facilitate the return of Iraqi nationals, [where reportedly 403 people are staying](https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/iraq/14122021?fbclid=IwAR1ipkMuzAE_YGit7OYcvkDnLv2m0rUhopFZsq7GxOmgOxYkhOITvxC1No8) \.

[Four hundred twenty return permits have been issued](https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/iraq/15122021?fbclid=IwAR1ipkMuzAE_YGit7OYcvkDnLv2m0rUhopFZsq7GxOmgOxYkhOITvxC1No8) to those stranded in Belarus\. The permits will allow people to return to Iraq — more than 3,000 people have already returned from Eastern countries to Iraq\.

But whilst the number of people both arriving and currently in Belarus is dropping, there are still many people who remain in terrible conditions, and [journalists and humanitarian groups are still banned](https://twitter.com/MarGorczynska/status/1470777618941231113?fbclid=IwAR053Ekf7_u_FJm5Detz6UlGiskC9UPL8dz8GwySdYNynEtCKKVw9Y2eCDw) \. [This Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/FundOcalenie/status/1471163770017927170) describes the process of communication in an attempt to assist a group with claiming asylum\. Contact was eventually lost\.

#### FRANCE
#### Further evictions in Northern France, are they legal?

[Further evictions took place in Calais](https://twitter.com/HumanRightsObs/status/1470798941474144263?fbclid=IwAR3UIrl69lS9Is8QY1W1OBk2ar5l_u5PIDJosilmBFGq8SK2JVicmYzBiiM) , as is so frequently the case\. Tents were taken by authorities leaving people vulnerable to winter weather\. [Organisations are challenging](https://twitter.com/HumanRightsObs/status/1471122686541766662?fbclid=IwAR3SHo5H5Z3RfUaQYRe3ztk0vyJFBuGwUbL9Ay_TDrV2JDGVzdOSsiVfcZc) the legality of the constant evictions at the court in Dunkirk\.

There is an appeal to provide fire wood for the winter conditions for people sleeping rough in Calais\. [More information here\.](https://www.helloasso.com/associations/l-auberge-des-migrants/collectes/projet-woodyard?fbclid=IwAR3OWn2eqH9V68MqYbRTn7y994_bDiNM8WUsdjmTOqBRb1Bjd6HOSD-OgY0)
#### GERMANY
#### Young man died in Germany, after surviving Belarus and Poland

[The story of the sad death](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/37196/kurdish-refugee-baxtyar-anwar-reached-germany-only-to-die-there?fbclid=IwAR0VXIk8Twvw-eYQ73JUSS62yDHTk8YI4o0c5YlVJEEiXSd7F4u0i4m_t6k) of Baxtyar Anwar who died in Brandenburg demonstrates the extreme suffering faced by people in Belarus and Poland\. The 25\-year\-old from Iraqi Kurdistan had previously attempted to reach Western Europe to forge a new life outside of the camp he lived in with his family in Kurdistan\.

Despite ongoing travel restrictions, deportation flights have taken place from various German cities\.

The City of Berlin [has pledged to take in 500 refugees](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/37226/city-of-berlin-to-accept-500-afghan-refugees?fbclid=IwAR0VXIk8Twvw-eYQ73JUSS62yDHTk8YI4o0c5YlVJEEiXSd7F4u0i4m_t6k) from Afghanistan over the next five years\. The people being accepted will be identified as ‘particularly vulnerable’ by UNHCR — likely campaigners and activists against the Taliban regime\. Berlin has also announced a broadening of family reunification rules — allowing for members other than just spouse and children to be included\.
#### UK
#### Delays and changes to UK Afghan Resettlement Scheme

The Afghan Resettlement Scheme — for those who assisted British forces during the war — [has yet to be launched](https://twitter.com/SkyNews/status/1470681565017563137?fbclid=IwAR2c-WNreCdjPkWfUcNwp6qLohWDLC8a8t0FH-Pbz87_V5cDzvSh_pxA3V0) \.

Four months after the Taliban took Kabul and the British government promised help amidst a media frenzy, the scheme has left people stranded and in danger\.

#### EU
#### Further policy changes — Human rights at the Eastern border

The EU Commission has [announced changes to the governance](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_6821) of the Schengen area\. The statement concerns both internal and external border controls, allowing internal checks to last up to two years\. Additionally, it appears that chain pushbacks \(involving several countries\) are to be formalised and more patrols at external borders will occur\.

The Left responded with a strong and [critical statement](https://left.eu/commission-schengen-proposals-a-major-setback-for-fundamental-rights/?fbclid=IwAR0AOcXKB2-8xkvB1uiyG7e4SeTpY461-JIEMWixEZrkDOQdyH-bhpiaSEA) :

This comes as [drones with tasers](https://twitter.com/_PMolnar/status/1470688923210891264) are unveiled for use at the US/Mexico border\.

The European Council on Refugees and Exiles have published a response to the proposed policy changes regarding the Eastern Border countries\.

“ [ECRE does not support the measures proposed](https://ecre.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ECRE-Comments-COM_FINAL.pdf) , which will have an adverse effect on the right to asylum without adequately responding to the situation at the EU’s borders with Belarus\.”
