### Dangerous road from Fallujah

At least three children and an elderly man drowned in the Euphrates River over the weekend as they attempted to flee the Iraqi city of Fallujah\. At least 200 people have successfully crossed the river using inflatable rings or makeshifts rafts made up of refrigerators and tires, [the International Rescue Committee reports](http://www.rescue.org/press-releases/children-drown-hundreds-fleeing-fallujah-risk-lives-crossing-euphrates-river-31159) \.

The IRC’s Iraq Country Director, Aleksander Milutinović, said:


> “The world has become used to seeing refugees risking everything by crossing the open sea and are now seeing reminiscent scenes at the Euphrates River\. From dawn to dusk, desperate Iraqis are risking their lives by crossing the river by any means necessary\. The Iraqi authorities urgently need to provide safe passage for all those fleeing Fallujah to ensure their lives aren’t further placed at risk\.” 





50,000 civilians are still thought to be trapped inside the city of Fallujah\.
#### Greece
### 17 new arrivals to Lesvos

According to the official sources, no new arrivals were registered in Greece over the last 24 hours\. However, volunteers from the Spanish group [Proactiva Open Arms](https://www.facebook.com/proactivaservice/) , are reporting about a boat with 17 people, including 3 children, one of them only month and a week old, arriving at Lesvos last night\. All are from Syria\.

Government sources identified 52,578 refugees and migrants on the Greek territory on Monday\. According to the Refugee Crisis Management Coordination Body’s figures, 27,002 of the refugees are in northern Greece, 14,568 are hosted in the region of Attica, 8,430 on the Greek islands and 2,578 are hosted in different areas in central and southern Greece\. Refugees and migrants in central Greece reached 2,295 on Monday, while those located in southern Greece came to 283\.

The Greek government announced today that changes have been made to the type of food distributed in refugee centers due to Ramadan\. The timing of food distribution is also adjusted, the migration ministry announced\. At the same time, the Education and Religious Affairs Ministry has announced that the capital’s Peace and Friendship Stadium \(SEF\) in Neo Faliro and the Olympic Stadium \(OAKA\) in Maroussi will be made available for Muslims wishing to celebrate the end of Ramadan at the beginning of next month\. Groups wishing to use the facilities should forward applications in writing to the board of SEF or OAKA by June 17\. Muslims in other areas of Greece are advised to contact local authorities to find out about prayer areas\.
### Riots and fire in Souda camp

Today in Souda camp on Chios, a group of inhabitants set the fire causing damage to several offices and some tents\. Allegedly, this was their way to demand relocation to Athens\. However, this way of protesting is damaging for all residents who are already in a very harsh situation\. Firefighters and riot police were called\. One firefighter was injured\.

Due to the fire, probably about 400 people now have no shade or shelter\. EASO were about to start admissibility interviews in Souda this week, but now they have no offices to do that and the asylum procedures, which are required before the Greek authorities can allow the refugees to continue to Athens for the next stage of the asylum procedures, will probably now be delayed\.

Several similar protest occurred over the last couple of week in different camps in Greece\. AYS reported about fires in a hot spot of Moria, Lesvos, and fire at hot sport on Samos\. In Moria, several people were badly injured while hundreds were left without temporary shelter\.
### Moria — security concerns

Frequent incidents of violence are reported at Moria camp, according to the News That Moves\. Refugees are claiming that local authorities are not doing enough to protect them\. Refugees told [News That Moves](https://newsthatmoves.org/en/refugees-in-lesvos-camp-authorities-arent-protecting-us/) that is was the lack of an adequate police presence, the availability of alcohol and the failure of Greek authorities to separate single men from families that had created a dangerous environment at Moria\.

An Afghan man, who identified himself as a leader of the Afghan community at Moria, said it was usually intoxicated single men who caused problems at the site\. “The fight last week broke out when an Afghan and a Pakistani were separating two Nepalis fighting each other, for some reason that is not known yet,” he said\. “But most of the fights are caused by drunk single men\.” Police already admitted there is no enough officer in Moria\.

The Afghan community leader explained that Afghans at Moria had taken security into their own hands by taking turns to act as guards at the entrance to their compound\. “We have two men from us guarding the Afghan family compound 24/7,” he said\. “They change shifts every two hours\. We don’t allow any strangers to enter\. This way we are protecting our families and ourselves\.”
### Relocation from Hara to began soon

According to the [Northern Lights Aid](https://www.facebook.com/Northernlightsaid/?fref=nf) team, this morning busses arrived at Hara camp to transport residents to government\-run camps\. People were invited embark buses voluntarily\. Police announced more buses will come in the following days, and a mandatory eviction is likely\. The situation in Hara remained calm and peaceful today\. We will follow developments\.

### Serbia is a transit point for refugees

Although over one million people are estimated to have passed through Serbia during the past two years, only 34 expressed a desire to remain during 2015\. Fewer than half that number have sought refugee status so far during 2016, [Balkan Insight reports](http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/few-refugees-seek-asylum-in-serbia-05-29-2016#sthash.3FT2oW1S.KuAitzzw.dpuf) \. “It is hard for refugees to stop in Serbia, at the gate of the EU\. They ask themselves why to stay in Serbia when the economic situation here is so bad,” says Radoš Đurović, director of Belgrade\-based NGO Asylum Protection Centre\.

Đurović says refugees get little or no help from the state regarding immigration\. But he is convinced that even if there were more help, refugees would not stay in Serbia\.
### Call for volunteers in Subotica

### Refugees are continue to flee from southern Sudan

After five years of war in southern Sudan, thousands of refugees are continuing to flee, placing further pressure on already strained resources in neighboring South Sudan, the [UN Refugee Agency said](http://www.unhcr.org/news/latest/2016/6/575176254/five-years-south-sudan-conflict-refugees-still-flee.html#_ga=1.105980800.2083943860.1463497055) \. So far in 2016, more than 7,500 refugees from the region have arrived in Yida in South Sudan’s northern Unity area\. In May alone, nearly 3,000 people reached the area, which is already home to some 70,000 refugees\. With the conflict in Sudan intensifying, thousands more are expected in the coming weeks\. The refugees are mainly from Heiban, Um Doreein and Al Boram counties, in South Kordofan’s Nuba Mountains\. They spoke of escalating violence, including ground attacks and aerial bombardments there\.


> “The recent arrivals also cite lack of food and no access to schools for children as reasons for leaving, especially in and around Um Doreein\. Most people are arriving by the truck while others come on foot or by bicycle, traveling up to seven days,” UNHCR spokesperson Adrian Edwards said\.
