#### Feature:

Messages of support have been spreading for the captain Pietro Marrone of Mare Jonio, who is currently under investigation for the crime of ‘facilitating the illegal immigration’ and ‘the violation of Italian Navigation code because the captain refused to stop at the order of a military ship\.’

On the way back to Italy, \(12 miles\) from Lampedusa, the military police ordered Pietro Marone to stop the vessel, which had 70 people on board, and turn off the engines\. However, at the time the sea was extremely rough with 3 meter waves, and the captain refused to follow these orders, in the fear that it would bring the ship into a critical situation endangering the lives of everyone on board\. A truly heroic and noble decision\.

He has been quoted as saying that he would do it all again to save the people’s lives\. _“What was I supposed to do, let them die?”_ he said\.

Luca Casarini, the mission chief of the migrant rescue NGO Mediterraneo, has also been placed under investigation for complicity in the rescue efforts of captain Pietro\. The Search and Rescue vessel in question ‘Mare Jonio’ is run by the Rome based NGO Mediterranea — Which is also under investigation for rescuing people from a sinking boat off the coast of Libya\.


> The rest of the crew, we are free of investigation\. Salvinis cries for the immediate arrest of everyone on board Mare Jonio didn’t work out\. There are protests and solidarity actions taking place all around Italy against Salvini s policy of “Closed Ports” and we are already planning the return of Mare Jonio, committed not to tolerate the political decisions that turn the Mediterranean Sea into a huge graveyard\. — [Iasonas Apostolopoulos](https://www.facebook.com/iasonas.apos?__tn__=%2CdCH-R-R&eid=ARDSTRbh1WMT7mP16VTOf3XRkWPqPdRnnaMzpDOEXp2OZDg2Hbl1azKm04VVMb74US60kEDoR8VKcqMM&hc_ref=ARRcum45q8Ni9XcTSctdntlGUO_m579phhLDVz1S62tCqFbkLffhjaNq1n03bKHGJU0&fref=nf)

#### TUNISIA

Two people have been deported from Tunisia to Morocco according to a joint press release made by FTDES and Alarm Phone\. They report that the men of Senegalese nationality were arbitrarily detained by Tunisian authorities upon their entry to the country, where their documents were confiscated and the authorities prepared the proceedings of their deportation\.

Generally, Senegalese nationals are not required to apply for a visa before travelling to Tunisia\. The two individuals were invited by the Tunisian association FTDES\.

#### MOROCCO

AMediterranean fishing vessel rescued a number of people whose boat had began to capsize off Morocco\. The survivors are from sub\-Saharan Africa and were at great risk of drowning in the sea\.

According to [a report](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/15867/ngo-accuses-morocco-of-campaign-of-targeted-repression) , the [Moroccan Association for Human Rights](http://www.amdh.org.ma/) \(AMDH\) has disclosed that in the year 2018, Moroccan authorities were responsible for 340 ‘irregularities’ that negatively impacted people on the move\. AMDH also reports that 9,100 foreign nationals were jailed in Nador \(including 650 minors who were subsequently released in other areas of Morocco and left without any assistance\) and a further 15,000 were jailed in Tangiers in what they label a ‘campaign of targeted repression\.’

AMDH also explains that Nador has become a ‘migrant free zone’ where people on the move are only tolerated if they remain in reception camps — where they are generally ‘collected’ until they are expelled from the country\. Over 70,000 arrests were made in 2018\.
