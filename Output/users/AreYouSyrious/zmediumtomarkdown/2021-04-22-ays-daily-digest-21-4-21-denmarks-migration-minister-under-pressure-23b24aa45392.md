### Denmark

Denmark’s Migration Minister Mattias Tesfaye is under pressure, according to journalist Benjamin Holst: The report he used to justify his plans to deport Syrian refugees was based on the [Country of Origin Information](https://www.altinget.dk/udvikling/artikel/dansk-flygtningehjaelp-vi-kan-ikke-sende-syriske-flygtninge-hjem?fbclid=IwAR2b5d1R94X9wW_c9Tb2QAeqEr0YwNLxKkC_PF_v6SlEUjQD5XCz42DvWmU) \(COI\), which is usual, “but freedom of movement can be heavily restricted”, reminds Holst\. Lighthouse Reports discovered that an op\-ed piece had been removed, and this has led now to serious criticism\.

In a [new disclosure](https://politiken.dk/indland/art8180941/Nu-tager-11-af-12-navngivne-kilder-afstand-fra-Syrien-rapporter?fbclid=IwAR2b5d1R94X9wW_c9Tb2QAeqEr0YwNLxKkC_PF_v6SlEUjQD5XCz42DvWmU) , Lighthouse Reports has gone public with a statement denouncing the use of their material, showing that 11 of the original 12 sources for the report used by the Danish government to justify the revocation of residence permits for the Syrian refugees in Denmark were overlooked, leaving a general in the Syrian government of Assad as the sole source, who claimed safety for the returned\.

Save the Children is additionally raising [concerns](https://www.savethechildren.net/news/denmark-sacrificing-future-70-syrian-children) , that some 70 children could be affected by the plans of the Danish government\. They are now waiting for the second and final decision and are at risk of losing their residence permit\. Save the Children’s Syria Response Director Sonia Khush said:


> You simply cannot say that any part of Syria is safe\. Such an argument is not in line with international standards and does not reflect the reality on the ground\. 




At the same time, the Danish government plans to increase the requirements for citizenship, InfoMigrants [reports](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/31671/denmark-raises-the-bar-on-citizenship?fbclid=IwAR3TZ6gcotE7BAQ8q66FFdWxU474U7ILVPyYHvCKFF3Vxda6ALVPWwIBOlU) \.
### Greece

Aegean Boat Report collected new evidence of pushbacks, which occurred on 14 and 16 April\. In the first case, 51 people were stopped on their boat by the Hellenic Coast Guard, northeast of Korakas, Lesvos, and then they were deported\. The boat was towed away towards Behram in Turkey and then picked up by the Turkish Coast Guard\. In another case, 48 people were attacked by three men in an RIB, towing them away from Lesvos\.

Meanwhile, Oxfam International criticized the closure of the Kara Tepe camp on Lesvos, where 1000 people lived\. Most of them were considered vulnerable\. “The decision to close the camp was not accompanied by a communicated plan for its residents, some who have already been moved to Mavrovouni in recent days,” Oxam [writes](https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/closure-model-camp-greek-islands-amidst-horrific-living-conditions-cause-concern?fbclid=IwAR3nTGXr4Vcv7WpDpmGym77DeZbL8xkMxA18Y-s_Ra1J2FfAw33n0j2N110) \.

As refugees face homelessness and destitution in Greece, it is not surprising that thousands still try to reach the rest of the EU.

Cláudia Pereira further told the High Commission for Migration \(ACM\), that entities working with migrants will receive four million euros, [writes](https://www.theportugalnews.com/news/2021-04-21/portugal-will-receive-50-more-refugees/59446?fbclid=IwAR3kNzG_gfJhh3VjmdFUjhzQxj0ki6sX29Ngm5j9vq5DJn_4YuLI01z-9-g) the Portugal News\. During the pandemic, the country already welcomed 116 people\.
### France

Minors have been arrested during administrative meetings with the social department for children in Nice, [reports](https://www.infomigrants.net/fr/post/31646/nice-des-jeunes-migrants-arretes-menottes-a-la-sortie-des-bureaux-de-l-aide-a-enfance?fbclid=IwAR0zxv_1pQpfQRC7k5rdtm0kws9us61Mj62MshutBlqkFph9KsYsxrCua98) Info Migrants\. [Additionally](https://www.infomigrants.net/fr/post/31630/france-arrestations-de-trafiquants-qui-detournaient-l-allocation-pour-demandeurs-d-asile?fbclid=IwAR3NKaf7t3trf7TY5B5NJw36yHxDx7JEN0CeVkcFXgYmU1wytNNkIkwNSDU) , police arrested traffickers stealing ADA cards from asylum seekers\.
### Germany

With no running water, no heat, high rents and provisions, refugees are being exploited by an investor, [reports](https://www.rbb24.de/wirtschaft/beitrag/2021/04/gefluechtete-miethaeuser-ausbeutung-berlin-padovicz-werttax.html?fbclid=IwAR0PF4ItVjV4Tpa_gr41cKNMb443QTdZAbOw7EiA3NT8wdlZaCfs3lHovgc) public TV channel RBB24\. A team of the new _Shadowworlds Berlin_ found that suspicious activities can be seen going on in at least four buildings: The Padovicz group of infamous investor Gijora Padovicz leases the flats to the Werttax Group GmbH, which sublets them to refugees through translators who are compensated with several thousand euros as their reward\. Then the families are moved to the dire flats\. With separate contracts for the same party, only parts are covered of the total\. With this, the Jobcenter, which pays the rent as a social benefit, doesn’t know that the rent is higher than it would allow\. According to rbb, the overall rent is much higher than the average in the neighborhood\.

The Padovics group said that leasing the buildings was normal, it keeps its buildings in good shape and is not aware of such incidents\.

With preparations for pulling the military out of Afghanistan, Germany’s defense minister [said](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/31675/520-afghan-translators-may-be-offered-protection-in-germany?fbclid=IwAR3F5o6JggNjdtfFJd8UjroQmBaH-7jk8pkcxvAAafKENCs_B3xzVVA8o6g) that 520 Afghan translators and their families could be offered protection in Germany\. She spoke about a “deep obligation” to not leave the people behind unprotected\.

### UK

After an odyssey of almost two years, two Iranian women have been granted asylum in the UK\. “I can see the future now”, said Sanaz Derikvandi, 33\. It took an article in the Guardian for the two to be allowed an interview with the Home Office\. Care4Calais accompanied them over these years\.

### General

At least 18,000 unaccompanied minors have disappeared after arriving in Europe since 2018\. This means 17 children a day, [calculates](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/apr/21/nearly-17-child-migrants-a-day-vanished-in-europe-since-2018?fbclid=IwAR2jxsTIwbXCY02CG9bEGO5AVAyROO-KYDPNlHAgIWY0KsdxF9f9HPqNiww) The Guardian\. In 2020, some 5800 went missing\. However, the number could be even higher, as the data is often “inconsistent or incomplete”\. For example Denmark, France and the UK provided no information, and Spain, Belgium and Finland stopped after 2019\. A spokesperson for the European Commission said that data collection and cross\-border collaboration need to be improved\.
