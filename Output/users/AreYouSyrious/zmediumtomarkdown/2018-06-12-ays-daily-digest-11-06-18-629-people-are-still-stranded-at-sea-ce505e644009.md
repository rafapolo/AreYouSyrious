#### Feature — Spain pledges to accept Aquarius but crew warns of dangerous journey

As AYS reported yesterday, the far\-right Italian interior minister Matteo Salvini rejected the rescue ship Aquarius for landing as it was approaching Italian waters\. As of writing, the ship is still trapped in the same place it was yesterday, between Spain and Malta\.

The Spanish government has promised today to take in the stranded people\. However, the difficulties for those aboard are not yet over, even if they do dismebark in Valencia\. The port of Valencia is a three day journey, and the people aboard have already been trapped for over 72 hours\. The groups jointly operating the ship, SOS Méditerranée and MSF Sea, have said that the journey to Valencia would not be safe for the 629 people because of weather conditions and their dwindling food supply\.

“The safety and the care of the survivors on board cannot be assured beyond a few hours\. We cannot imagine that political concerns prevail over the humanitarian situation of these hundreds of people just saved from drowning, hours after having left the hell that is Libya\.” [said Sophie Beau](https://sosmediterranee.com/on-instructions-from-rome-the-aquarius-is-stopped-at-sea-between-malta-and-italy-waiting-for-a-safe-port-to-disembark-629-survivors/) , VP of SOS Méditerranée’s international network\.

MSF has called upon European Member States to allow for the disembarkation of the ship at the nearest port because there are multiple people with serious injuries aboard\. “The Aquarius is already well over maximum capacity\. The health and safety of people rescued onboard, inlcuding sick and injured people, pregnant women and children must come first,” said [MSF on Twitter](https://twitter.com/MSF_Sea/status/1006218078449958912) \.

Those saved include 123 unaccompanied minors, 11 infant children and toddlers, and seven pregnant women, according to SOS Méditerranée, the group that operates the ship with MSF Sea\.

Multiple Italian mayors, including Leoluca Orland of the Sicilian capital Palermo, promised to accept the ship in their ports\. Orlanda accused Salvini of violating international and maritime law by turning the Aquarius away, and said that the port of Palermo was “always open” to those in need\. However, docking in an Italian port with only the protection of local authorities could prove dangerous for the Aquarius while they are still under threat from the interior minister\. It was a Sicilian court that impounded the rescue ship Open Arms only earlier this year\.

Some, including EU Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos, were quick to call Spain’s decision to accept the ship as a victory\. However, if the ship does end up going to Spain, this could set a dangerous precedent for the far\-right Italian government\. If Salvini is able to refuse this ship, what will happen to the next one?


■■■■■■■■■■■■■■

> > Welcome the decision of the Spanish Government to let the Aquarius disembark in Valencia for humanitarian reasons. This is real solidarity put in practice, towards both these desperate and vulnerable people and towards fellow EU Member States. #migrationEU [twitter.com/desdelamoncloa…](https://twitter.com/desdelamoncloa/status/1006156067926171649)

According to MSF journalist Agus Morales, “ If the Italian government gets the rescue ship not to reach one of its ports, it will have won a political victory\. and redefine rescue operations in the Mediterranean\. It’s a key moment\.”

EU countries should be doing more to assist each other with the acceptance and integration of refugees\. But doing so on these terms, essentially under threat, is not an act of “real solidarity” as Avramopoulos claims\. It is simply a response to a political hostage situation\. Italian authorites are playing games with 629 lives, as they test how far they can push EU authorities and the limits of international law\.

Real solidarity would be creating a fair system asylum and integration across the EU and reunifiying families across borders\. The celebration of a plan to force 629 people on a dangerous and unnecessary three\-day journey shows just how detached EU migration officials are from the people they are supposed to protect\.

The response to the stranded 629 people is an example of how EU member states tend to act only reactively to arriving refugees\. Action is only taken, if at all, when people are put in grave danger in the public eye\.
### Afghanistan

This monday, [six attacks took place in Afghanistan,](https://www.rferl.org/a/taliban-attack-roadside-bomb-kill-more-than-20-in-afghanistan/29283016.html) killing over 53 people, and injuring at least 41 more\. The rising violence in the country begs the question of how the EU can defend classifying Afghanistan as a “safe third country” for deportations\.
### Sea

SMH ship the Salvamar Arcurus rescued 11 men from a dinghy off the coast of Tarifa\. Later in the day the ship rescued two minors from Maghreb who were on a dinghy\. They were also transported to Tarifa\.

The Salvamento boat Salvamar Gadir rescued 32 men and 1 woman today in front of the Camarinal lighthouse\. The boat was very close to the land, and nine people were thrown into the water right before the rescue\.

The boat Guardamar Concepcion Arenal rescued 44 men and 1 woman from a dinghy 3\.5 miles southeast of Barbate, where they disembarked\.
### Greece
#### Islands
#### New Arrivals

One boat arrived on the island of Oinousas this morning, carrying a total of 36 people\. There were 12 minors, 15 women, and nine men aboard\. The people aboard were transfered to Chios a few hours later\.

According to statistics released by the UNHCR, 662 people arrived on the Aegean islands this week\. In total there are now approximately 15,000 people trapped in the island detention camps\. Another alarming figure revealed in the UNHCR’s weekly report is that 11% of children in the Aegan island camps are seperated from their immediate family\.

The UNHCR continues to prove itself to be very good at observing humanitarian disasters and crafting statistical reports on them\. They are less good at providing for people’s basic needs, and advocating for children and families\. All throughout their reports, the UNHCR cites their “observations”, but there is little mention of action\. Perhaps the UNHCR could clarify their role by changing the name to the agency for refugee observation, rather than protection\.

Action from Switzerland provided a brief update on their ongoing work in Chios today:


> “After the winds died down, there have been 76 new arrivals on Chios for the month of June\. It is a myth that the “crisis” is over\. It will not be over as long as the wars continue and oppressive border systems that have been designed by Europe to keep people out remain…\. Our Athena Centre for Women on Chios is ready for a new week to receive women and girls\. Air condition is on full blast, and barrels of cool drinking water on standby\!

#### Mainland
#### Did Greek Police Murder a refugee in Patras Port?

[Greek media outlets are reporting](http://www.documentonews.gr/article/tragiko-telos-gia-metanasth-poy-prospathhse-na-kryftei-sta-hmiaxonia-ntalikas#.Wx2NgkJMExM.twitter) the death of a 19 year old in Patras Port\. This Port has become infamous as a place where refugees try to escape onto ships to reach other destinations in Europe\. It is very dangerous for those who attempt it, because of unsecured spaces people often hide in, and because of the brutality of the port police\. Last month, Refugee Support Aegean released a report documenting police violence at the Port\. All of the people interviewed by RSA described being attacked by port police when they were found hiding\.

Allegedly the man died after being discovered and beaten by police when he was found hiding under the chassis of a truck\. If this account is true, then his death was not an accident but a murder\. We are still looking for further confirmation on this story\.

The Italian Interior Ministry recently released the data on the number of asylum applications in the country in May of this year\. According to their figures, there were 5,172 total applications in May alone\. The top country of origin was Nigeria, with 623 Nigerian people applying for asylum\.

This past Friday an estimated 5,000 people demonstrated against racism in Milan after the death of Soumaila Sacko, an agricultural worker and union activist from Mali\. Sacko was shot by a farmer in an abandoned area where refugees were regularly picking up corrugated metal plates to improve their tents and barracks\. The farmer claimed to be the owner of the area, as if this gave him the right to murder someone\. It was proven that the area is under municipal control because it’s heavily contaminated\.
### France

For the past four months, the disused building of University Paris 8 Saint\-Denis has been occupied by refugees\. Now authorities have announced their intention to evict these people, despite the failure of the city government to find alternative housing options\. The eviction has been announced for [June 18\.](https://www.facebook.com/ExileesOccupP8/posts/2015676955417366)


![“This is where a group of 6/7 people — men and women — sleep\. On the ground, with no tent, and along a main road — with lots of noise, cars and pollution\. Those in the streets have no camp to go to anymore and so are made to sleep on the ground\. I fear Paris will become more and more like Calais\. Since the evacuation of the camps in Paris, people living in the streets are spread across the north of Paris and sleep on the concrete\.” Photo Credit: [Faces Before Numbers](https://www.facebook.com/FacesBeforeNumbers/photos/a.370049416799720.1073741829.368064216998240/443399666131361/?type=3&theater)](assets/ce505e644009/1*rmZ--dLhyisw97wxNWSdxQ.jpeg)

According to volunteers in the capital, tear gas was used this weekend to chase out migrants at the Porte de la Chapelle right before the breakfast distribution done by the solidarité Migrants Wilson group\.

A solidarity march for refugees will be happening on June 17 in Paris, click [here](https://www.facebook.com/AubergeMigrants/posts/10156105390990339?hc_location=ufi) for more information\.

336 people were evicted from makeshift encampments in Dunkirk today and were brought to reception centers\. The majority of those evicted seem to have been Kurdish refugees form Iraq\. They were living in a former manufacturing plant which was highly contaminated\.

[From Refugee Info Bus](https://www.facebook.com/RefugeeInfoBus/videos/2157243301177753/) :


> Police violence takes place every single day in Calais, and is a usual part of life for the displaced population here\. 





> In [this video](https://www.facebook.com/RefugeeInfoBus/videos/2157243301177753/) , sent to us by a French citizen, a police officer is seen chasing a displaced person with a canister of chemical agent then, as the man attempts to run away from this assault, the officer forcefully kicks him\. 





> This kind of violence, carried out by officers of the law, is outrageous and must stop\. The systematic abuse of displaced people in France cannot be allowed to continue\. 




### Slovenia/Austria

Austrian authorities have announced a large scale military exercise to take place on the Slovenian border on 25 June\. The Slovenian government is protesting the move, saying that the arrival of refugees in Austria does not justify a military presence\.

“We’ve been notified about the planned exercise\. We disagree with the date, location, and the concept of the exercise itself,” Tweeted the official Slovenian police account\.

Austrian Prosecutor Fritz Lang said that the number of reufgees attempting to enter the country form Slovenia was already low, about thirty a day, “largely because of the good work the Croatian police have been doing\.” Apparently, [shooting families and children](ays-daily-digest-9-6-18-dangerous-fruits-of-the-in-securitisation-195b81efa3ec) is included in this “good work” of the Croatian police\.
### Belgium

The European Court has determined that asylum centers in Greece have improved, and based on this finding, Belgium is now allowing asylum seekers to be deported to Greece under the Dublin agreement\. It is hard to tell how the European Court arrived at their decision considering the appalling state of most refugee camps in Greece\.
### Netherlands

The YALLA foundation has created a handbook for refugees who are moving or living in Nijmegen in the Netherlands\. The booklet is currently available in English, Dutch, Arabic, and Tigrinya\. You can access it [here](https://www.facebook.com/yallafoundationNL/posts/1003428013159995) \.
