### AYS Daily Digest 6/8/19 121 people remain with Open Arms while being refused refuge past the grave yard of the Mediterranean

_Updated stats on Greece // Tunisian authorities maintaining their “ignorance” to the outcome of 36 people // Aegean Boat report needs help // Calling on the Home Secretary in the UK // and more…_
### Tunisia

In the latest update from [Melting Pot Europe](https://www.facebook.com/meltingpoteuropa/photos/a.700935699938160/2586210521410659/?type=3&theater) on the 36 people deported to Libya:


> A delegation of activists just spoke with the manager of the garde nationale in Ras Agedir, just a few meters from [\#Libya](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/libya?source=feed_text&epa=HASHTAG&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARAIjfXA_Q0klMFHWt3tgGDnsg2xEcrFx0uwVSvsrgm_85uCsy9XQ68kQTzXbAvoEk8NBZhZhPEDyfOLyFaT2WIGKnzaoJGuhI-CMic8XvtCOmElyLRnPV9uWjqIh03Z4wspNMaR7owhKFOHnJNxpeEbFTCoh10MXQf8UNtGsKFfBbkrgtZZGJN8jCQRT_SeT3YA26sXVgIcvlm7&__tn__=%2ANK%2AF) \. The official position of the authorities has not changed: they argue that they do not have any information about the migrant group\. But the difficulty in denying the evidence was perceptible: urged to comment on the audio published on the press or the statements of IOM, UNHCR and Croissant Rouge, the officer did not disprove the veracity nor tried to disprove\. He just repeated that he was free of information\. 





> That’s why activists decided to stay on the border, reaffirming once again that they will not leave this border until they guarantee the security that all 36 people are safe\.

### Sea

[Giulia Tranchina](https://www.facebook.com/rastajuly/posts/10156847918183621?hc_location=ufi) also reports that there are 2 babies and 3 pregnant women aboard, two of which are at term\. There are a total of 121 people, including 32 minors\. Many people have infected gunshot wounds\.

Tommy Olsen, the creator and sole runner of Aegean Boat Report, who’s reporting on the arrivals in the Mediterranean we all rely on so much, has reached the 80% point of his fundraiser to continue his work\. Yet the remaining 20% is still crucial for him to be able to support his efforts full time\. Please check him out [here](https://www.facebook.com/donate/493847507854590/496482560924418/) \.

A new policing practice in Athens called “Operation net” sounds like a darker chapter in the history of the police in the capital, where abusive police sweeps were common\. Human Rights Watch warns that many of these practices are solely based on how the person in question looks to identity potential migrants\.

Unfortunately another body of a man was found under a bus Agrinio on Sunday\. The bus had German license plates and the man probably mistook the direction and his ability to survive\.

In a statement from [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.it/approvazione-decreto-sicurezza-bis/) on the new “security order”:


> “Beyond the individual norms, what we want to highlight is the clear intent that the decree pursues: limiting and discouraging civil society from fighting for the rights of all\. 





> Although the Viminale data show that in the last year landings have dropped dramatically and that there is no invasion underway, migrants continue to be depicted as the main factor of danger for public safety\. In addition, it has been widely demonstrated that NGOs are not an attraction factor for departures\.” 





[40 people](http://www.ansa.it/sicilia/notizie/2019/08/06/sbarco-migranti-nellagrigentino_a29d183a-0b55-4d4e-9e8b-7bbaf06fa211.html) arrived from Tunisia at Punta Bianca beach on Tuesday\. They were able to get off of the boat before the authorities got there, and no one has taken a “serious initiative” to identify or help them\.
### Spain

A Boat with 9 people arrived Tuesday morning at the coast of Alicante, as the 6th boat located since Sunday\. One boat arrived on Sunday, and four boats arrived on Monday, with at least 48 people arriving in the last 48 hours\.

### Denmark

[Inger Støjberg](https://www.thelocal.dk/20190806/denmarks-liberals-snub-hardline-former-immigration-minister?fbclid=IwAR0GXmxz2T0xhy4iO74EyA7PjSLMvQNxSXyl9VJYgMMQXjia-RfPN4o_lrc) , who enacted Denmark’s strictest immigration policies as the formal immigration ministere, will not the reach the top of the centre\-right Liberal Party\.

The most important impact of this news constitutes that the so\-called shift of paradigm, turning towards repatriation instead of integration, remains unaffected by the shift to the new Social Democrat government\.


> “Støjberg drove an extremely hard\-line immigration policy, bringing in a law allowing Danish police to strip refugees of cash and jewelry to help offset the cost of housing them \(although the law in the end turned out to be purely symbolic\) \. She claimed to have passed more than 100 measures to tighten immigration, notoriously celebrating with a cake when she passed the 50th through parliament\.”
