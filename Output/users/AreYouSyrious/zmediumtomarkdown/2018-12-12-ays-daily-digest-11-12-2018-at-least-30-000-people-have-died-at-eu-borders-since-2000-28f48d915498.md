#### FEATURE: Humanitarian Visa Proposal to Combat Inexcusable Death toll at European Borders \#SafePassage

The European Parliament has asked the Commission to submit a legislative proposal by 31st March 2019 so E\.U\. member countries can begin to offer a humanitarian visa\. Around 90% of people who were later granted international protection reached the EU through irregular means, the EP has reported\. According to the [statement](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20181205IPR20933/humanitarian-visas-to-avoid-deaths-and-improve-management-of-refugee-flows) , “MEPs stress that, despite many announcements and requests for safe and legal pathways for asylum\-seekers into Europe, the EU lacks a harmonized framework of protected entry procedures\.”

429 MEPs voted in favour of the legislative initiative, while 194 voted against and 41 abstained\.

The European Parliament believes a humanitarian visa would decrease the inexcusable death toll of unsafe asylum routes, combat smuggling and exploitation, and improve the use of migration funds and asylum procedures\.

Since the year 2000, over 30,000 people have died at European borders\.

One example of many, which illustrates the lack of safety and security associated with irregular means of travel to reach European countries, is highlighted in a report released by Human Rights Watch, which examines acts of border violence by Croatian police towards asylum seekers entering Croatia from Bosnia\.

[Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/12/11/croatia-migrants-pushed-back-bosnia-and-herzegovina?fbclid=IwAR1MXfy99N2hQ_4T73g1auyshV3AW_b4aOhfYw2jMZT-khwpksdAoCg12PI) interviewed dozens of people who said they were pushed\-back to Bosnia by Croatian police “without due process after detaining them deep inside Croatian territory\.” Even women and children reported being beaten with batons, kicked and punched\. Furthermore, those interviewed reported that police stole their money and confiscated or their mobile phones\. According to the Security Ministry of BiH, 493 people were returned under the bilateral readmission agreement with Croatia between January and 27th November\. 265 of them were Turkish nationals\. “None of the people Human Rights Watch interviewed underwent any formal return procedure before being forced back over the border,” the report noted\.
#### LIBYA

[Libyan Naval Forces state](https://www.libyaobserver.ly/inbrief/libyan-navy-welcomes-halting-non-governmental-organization-activities-mediterranean?fbclid=IwAR3cGepatrAruNLM5XoIGxcVW5uV2hcGJJFfAvL5LNNs7XJtePJsIDoPd50) that the suspension of NGOs performing sea rescue is a positive development for the goals of the Libyan Navy\. In a press statement, Ayoub Qassem, the spokesperson for the Libyan Naval Forces, declared that these NGOs were transferring people from Libya to Europe and are responsible for increasing migration\.

Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders \(MSF\) and SOS Méditerranée organizations, who operated rescues using the Aquarius Vessel, have described the forced cessation of operations as a ‘smear campaign’ by EU governments\.


> ‘Inhumane policies designed to deter migration do not stop people on the move\. They strengthen the corrupt officials and criminal gangs who profit from vulnerable people\. They criminalize and throw vulnerable people into the hands of those who exploit them\.’ — MSF International 





Meanwhile in Libya, there are reports that up to 20 people being detained in Khoms have attempted to commit suicide through ingesting medication \(none were successful\) \. Another message from a detained Sudanese man suggests that he was forced to load weapons during fighting in Tripoli\.

MSF reports that the Libyan Coast Guard has returned more than 14 thousand people trying to flee across the Mediterranean back to Libya\.


> _‘Survivors of torture and exploitation — returned to detention centers where basic human rights are non\-existent and abuse is rampant\.’ — MSF_ 




#### SEA

Helena Maleno Garzon reports that a boat carrying 55 people has sunk in the Alboran Sea\.


> A patera with fifty\-five lives sinks right now in the Alboran Sea\. Hours after signing the [\#PactoMundialMigraciones](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/pactomundialmigraciones?source=feed_text&epa=HASHTAG) fails again\.Rights are not regulated, protected\. 




#### GREECE

According to Aegean Boat Report, 42 people have arrived on Lesvos at 8 o’clock this morning\.

[The situation on Samos](https://www.vice.com/gr/article/kzvxex/fwtografies-apo-thn-agnwsth-kolasi-sto-prosfygiko-kamp-ths-samoy?fbclid=IwAR0j5iYyhcnM0tGEFg-R2di4Ch_5i_JbT0LWwAtET0e_zig6XaMy-IXC0XQ) is critical, despite the lack of media attention\. According to a recent article by VICE Greece, over 4,500 people are stuck on the island, living in facilities built to temporarily accommodate 650 people, and there are reports of garbage, mice and sewage overwhelming the reception centre in Vathy\. A lawyer from the Samos Association has stated that the people living in Vathy are being tortured — completely stuck, with no way forward or back\. The article also alleges exploitation of women in the camp\.

According to a report from AMNA news — Stratis Balaskas, on Lesvos this past Saturday, a 45 year old man from Bangladesh was beaten with a metal crowbar by a 29 year old man from Greece\. The attack, an act of racial violence, has left Eman Oudine with fractures, he has since been treated in hospital\.

**Solidarity in Thessaloniki —** _activists left signs saying: “Dear passengers, be careful not to get infected by the racism disease that spreads on Thessaloniki buses by the racist drivers \(many incidents occurred recently on the buses that go to the refugee camps\) PS if you smell something bad, it’s the bad smell of fascism and nationalism”_

**Solidarity in Athens —** _activists in Athens gathered at Syntagma Square today at 19\.30, to show solidarity with asylum seekers, to stand against the hostile environment that migrants have to face in the whole of fortress Europe_ — City Plaza Squat

#### ITALY

The prosecutor of Ragusa has announced that it has completed the Proactiva Open Arms Investigation\. The crimes that the commander will be charged with will likely include aiding illegal immigration as well as private violence\.

[The case against Proactiva Open Arms was previously dismissed](ays-daily-digest-07-06-2018-italy-closes-its-case-against-proactiva-open-arms-bf099fff554b) by the Italian Judiciary on the 07/06/2018 — it was confirmed by the Judiciary that Proactiva Open Arms acted in accordance with international law\.

Proactiva Open Arms has released a statement saying that they denounce the criminalization of solidarity by the Italian authorities\.

#### AUSTRIA

On the 10th of December, some 70 people gathered spontaneously at the detention center in Vienna to protest against deportations to Afghanistan and Nigeria via charter flights\. The [Refugee Protest Camp Vienna](https://www.facebook.com/RefugeeCampVienna/posts/2134499539935961) says, in this center one 20 year old Nigerian man, who is ill, is currently being detained\.

Despite the falling temperatures to as low as minus three degrees, people in Calais are still sleeping rough\. “Once again, hypothermia is a big risk,” Help Refugees warns, demanding the opening of emergency accommodation centers\. The Refugee Community Kitchen will continue to provide warm meals, and HR will distribute wood\.


[![Help Refugees]( "Help Refugees")](https://www.facebook.com/HelpRefugeesUK/posts/757936791233663)


The problems do not only affect single men but also families\. The Refugee Women’s Centre in Grande Synthe [states](https://www.facebook.com/refugeewomenscentre/posts/552279005197734) that last Friday alone, seven families asked the authorities to be transferred to accommodation centres — but no spaces were available\.


> The 115 service \[the national hotline for emergency shelter\] repeats each time we call that there is no space for families and that everything is full\. We call them several times per week, in vain\. The 115 has even asked us to stop calling\. 





To provide at least them a safe space, the RWC has spent more than 750 euros since last Friday\. Meanwhile, the city hall helped to find temporary solutions\.

In Paris, Refugee Ground Support reports that the so\-called “rat park” has been evicted this morning\.
#### UK

Boats continue to depart from France towards the UK\. There are reports that six people [were rescued](https://www.facebook.com/robert.butler.3367/posts/2104093186323318) in the English Channel, six miles off Dover, last night\.

The Stansted 15 were convicted of terror offences yesterday for their peaceful attempt to stop a deportation flight from the UK to Nigeria, Ghana and Sierra Leone\. “As a result of what we did, 11 people who were on that flight are still in the UK appealing against their removals … The inherent racism and violence of these forced removals remains,” [Pikpa on Lesvos](https://www.facebook.com/pikpalesvos/photos/a.1650078085267616/2236006776674741/?type=3&theater) quotes one of the activists\. In 2018 alone, 99 humanitarian volunteers and anti\-deportation activists faced criminal investigations, the [Institute of Race Relations](http://www.irr.org.uk/news/investigations-and-prosecutions-for-crimes-of-solidarity-escalate-in-2018/?fbclid=IwAR2Q4Sg7gRRHL_FQHZzIVvJmj-c_75KwBXBpGgpvWtrkLlUdHavTq5zXHtU) notes\.
