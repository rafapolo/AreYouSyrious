### Feature: Annual Torture Report released

The Border Violence Monitoring Network has published a torturte report for 2020 covering 286 first\-hand testimonies in the Balkans\. The key findings are the following:
#### Croatia:
- In 2020, BVMN collected 124 pushback testimonies from Croatia, documenting the treatment of 1827 people
- 87% of pushbacks carried out by Croatian authorities contained one or more forms of violence and abuse that BVMN assert amounts to torture or inhuman treatment
- Violent attacks by police officers against people on the move lasted up to six hours
- Unmuzzled police dogs were encouraged by officers to attack people who have been detained\.
- Food was rubbed into the open wounds of pushback victims\.
- People were forced to undress, officials set fire to their clothes and then pushed them back across borders in a state of undress\.

#### **Greece:**
- 89% of pushbacks carried out by Greek authorities contained one or more forms of violence and abuse that BVMN assert amounts to torture or inhuman treatment\.
- 52% of pushback groups subjected to torture or inhuman treatment by Greek authorities contained children and minors\.
- Groups of up to 80 men, women and children were forcibly stripped naked and detained within one room\.
- People were detained and transported in freezer trucks\.
- Brutal attacks by groups of Greek officers included incidents where they pinned down and cut open the hands of people on the move or tied them to the bars of their detention cells and beat them\.
- Multiple cases where Greek officers beat and then threw people into the Evros river with many incidents leading to people going missing, presumingly having drowned and died\.

Together with 12 other organizations, AYS contributed to the BVMN report, which concludes:


> The report presents evidence that we believe shows how the systematic violence used by Croatian and Greek authorities, may in many cases, constitute as torture or inhuman and degrading treatment\.

Reports of Frontex’s knowledge and participation in human rights violations at the EU’s external borders have prompted demands from the German parliament group of the Social Democrats \(SPD\) to replace Fabrice Leggeri, head of the border agency\. They are accusing him of being responsible for the rights violations of people on the move, Der Spiegel [reports](https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/frontex-skandal-spd-fordert-tiefgreifende-reform-der-grenzschutzagentur-a-6a951a12-9ac0-47cb-a5b2-72fa032a585d?fbclid=IwAR2okpVKT4KDex7youVTp6lMxC8pWdxmqVkc1Yw15ZG3HZbeVOJBwYg4JOk) \. Further, the fraction suggests a parlamentiaran control body similar to the one of Europol, with members of national and the European parliament\.

### Syria

The rate of suicide attempts in North West Syria is increasing, Save the Children [warns](https://www.savethechildren.net/news/north-west-syria-number-suicide-attempts-and-deaths-rise-sharply) \. In the first three months of 2021, the overall rate of suicide attempts rose by 86 percent compared to 2020\. Now, one in five suicide attempts for the whole region is made by a child\.


> Of those who attempted suicide, at least 42 are 15 years old or younger, while 18% are adolescents and young people between the ages of 16 and 20\. 




A mental health worker states in the report that 15 percent of their patients had suicidal thoughts\. Most of the suicides, 187, were among displaced people\.

The Syrian Network for Human Rights [reports](https://news.sn4hr.org/2021/05/04/syrian-regime-forces-arrested-civilians-from-the-same-family-in-eqerbat-town-in-hama-suburbs-on-may-3/?fbclid=IwAR22uo3_FXmTtzXsnAhK0zUqU4s6uea61pdcqI7ao9mgclzbA4-jr3csJKg) on raids on Eqerbat town by regime forces\. “SNHR documented that four civilians from the same family, including a retired colonel, were arrested and taken to an undisclosed location”, it is stated\. There were no legal warrants for the arrest, the families were not informed, and phones were confiscated: “SNHR fears that they will be subjected to torture and ultimately classified as forcibly ‘disappeared’, like approximately 85 percent of all detained persons in Syria\.” According to SNHR, at least 131,000 people are detained or forcibly disappeared in such detention centers\.
### Lebanon

Syrian students are effectively being blocked from taking school examinations in Lebanon, Human Rights Watch and the Center for Lebanese Studies has [revealed](https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/05/04/lebanon-allow-syrian-refugee-students-take-exams?fbclid=IwAR25zcm2vSRDVGWpYpumDG2GtgALe6i_d-sIzW6aVRG87_ffDJBtenYXRkI) \. By requiring them to provide documents like legal residence permits, which only few Syrians have, the Education Ministry makes it almost impossible for Syrian students to gain qualifications\. “Lebanon is undermining the hundreds of millions of dollars donors provide to educate refugee children by blocking them from taking school exams,” said Maha Shuayb, director of the Center for Lebanese Studies, a research institute\. 80 percent of Syrians in Lebanon do not have such legal residency\. Both organisations documented the cases of 18 Syrian children whom authorities have blocked from registering for their Grade 9 exams during the current school year, and 10 cases of students ages 18 or older who are unable to provide documents needed to apply for their Grade 12 exams\.
### Turkey

The Istanbul Policy Center [published](https://ipc.sabanciuniv.edu/Content/Images/CKeditorImages/20210503-21054423.pdf?fbclid=IwAR0qnmsy77LwckjyOeojcDMSv7NUcShw9gx5fo7GYp3fBcbCzU9XtTAwMag) an analysis on the impact of the EU\-Turkey cooperation on migrations along the Iran\-Turkey border\. Its report on pushbacks concludes: “Although migrants embark upon arduous treks across the Iran\-Turkey border with a well\-defined goal — to move from illegality to legality — their chances of formalizing their status upon arrival in Turkey are almost none\.” The Center also draws connections from this policy to the pushbacks happening all along the Balkans \(see the segment on the Balkans above\) \. As the EU\-Turkey deal from 2016 failed, authorities there are under higher pressure at their external borders\. Being afraid of pushbacks means that people can “try to travel onward to the EU with the hope of accessing legal protection, which undermines the logic behind enforcing tougher measures in Eastern Turkey”\.

In a report [published](https://www.ekathimerini.com/news/1160489/turkish-coast-guard-hassles-frontex-forces/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&fbclid=IwAR0TARE9X5QbUpVfIDrcCB6AL_KX2C7gaQQ_MobIZdH63SeqCU4Jmdvqf6Y) by Ekathimerini, the Turkish Coast Guard is accused of having violated Greek territorial waters and made dangerous maneuvers close to two ships of the Frontex operation Poseidon\. The incididents took place at the end of April this year\.
### Libya

The International Rescue Committee \(IRC\) [warns](https://www.rescue.org/press-release/irc-extremely-concerned-about-safety-migrants-and-refugees-being-returned-libya?fbclid=IwAR0Y4FokTgjR-fZCJxwBnxxR8AfoIqIbdDR4LKjv8dT-bU4SewXfFeA_ED8) about the safety situation for people being pulled\-back to Libya\. According to their own account, members of the IRC assisted 696 survivors of four cases since Thursday\. This year alone, the total number of survivors is 7000\. People were “immediately sent to overcrowded detention centres, where they are now at grave risk of ill\-treatment, exploitation and violence, and face a lack of access to basic services such as adequate hygiene and sanitation facilities”\. Country director Thomas Garofalo reminds that more than 500 people have drowned in the Mediterrenean this year already\.

The UNHCR [records](https://www.unhcr.org/news/briefing/2021/5/609134f74/unhcr-warns-mounting-refugee-migrant-deaths-central-mediterranean.html?fbclid=IwAR3I52T8o6j2dLSTx6VMGmqs01jU_O35a9Sgsl1tlNX2fDdVtrdg18NJSVQ) a high presence of children among people disembarking in Italy, many of them unaccompanied\. “Many are fleeing from war and conflicts, like in the Sahel where indiscriminate attacks constantly lead to death and forced displacement\. Many are fleeing persecution and being trafficked and sold like commodities,” spokesperson Carlotta Sami highlights\. Sami emphasises that most of the migratory movements happen close to the countries of origin or even within — in 80 percent of the cases\. While commending Italy for keeping its ports open for those arriving in Europe, Sami urges the other countries to show more solidarity:

Similar to the IRC, the UNHCR is aware of “imprisonment and brutalities inflicted with no respect for human life, while survivors often show severe mental health problems as a result of the traumas they have faced”\.
### Greece

The Hellenic Helsinki Accords Observatory \(HRAO\) requests the Athens Maritime Court Prosecutor’s Office to start investigations into 147 incidents of illegal, violent, racist refoulement \(at sea\) or deportation \(from the islands or the mainland\) during the period March — December 2020 with more than 7000 foreigners as victims, different NGOs have documented, according to [Racist Crimes Watch](https://racistcrimeswatch.wordpress.com/2021/05/04/1-1184/?fbclid=IwAR2VdZZjBVYuroJsekuLTuyc3wgGex1wOzPz2pg51Cpj5FZoej7f7-N3XUE) \.

The Hellenic Coast Guard rescued 184 people off the Peloponnese peninsula on Monday evening and transferred them to Kalamata port, UNHCR representative Mireille Girard reports\.

### Spain

The city council in Fuerteventura refuses to accomodate people on the move in hotels, even for a short time, EFE agency [writes](https://www.efe.com/efe/canarias/sociedad/corporaciones-de-fuerteventura-exigen-solucion-inmediato-a-la-inmigracion/50001312-4528132?fbclid=IwAR3GlsLC-orDWP-IGnGZLNu4gwf6CI1fYn8hNfsjHTinHTmT1WZup3NrbZk) \. They demand the Spanish government to “immediately” solve the issue upon arrival and move the people to other parts of the Canary islands or Spain\. The council is reluctant to take appropriate measures due to fears of deterring tourists and increasing social tensions\.

A 17 year old boy was stuck in Las Raíces camp, and transferred to Valencia with other adults, even though he had a birth certificate with him\. elDiario [documented his case](https://www.eldiario.es/canariasahora/migraciones/alcanzar-peninsula-proteccion-equivocada-menor-migrante-derivado-adulto_1_7894327.html?fbclid=IwAR3DfsJpD-kLpkoGH9H6aSPJRzM3AY7YazEEKZ6sTyKQLy8_5QLBnFcrq7E) \.

### UK

After making a Freedom of Information request, the Hope Projects [found out](https://hope-projects.org.uk/justice/?fbclid=IwAR1Zsp04CwIKA_bgmjZM5uzDk4tXnM-LcDHicB4eD3TLUESD-nBh9WQtqQY) that since 2015 more than 15,000 people have been granted asylum or some other form of leave to remain after having had an asylum appeal refused and then making further submissions\. “The asylum system is making many people street homeless and destitute to force them to return home,” the author concludes, warning that the “New Plan for Immigration” does not tackle this problem and instead tries to stop people from “from submitting the new information on which their lives may depend”\.


■■■■■■■■■■■■■■

Meanwhile, hundreds of people seeking protection in the UK have been warned that they could be deported to other European countries, according to [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/683c4d86-fddf-43ee-a721-09ec1fe6ad55?fbclid=IwAR2S0A-H017hQ10WmcIBCcdjYcNHaKUvkf0jyL0EDgyyn0HpenmrPsETC1c) \. However, there are no bilaterial agreements so far, and by leaving the EU’s single market this year, the UK also quit the Dublin agreement\. Therefore the UK government so far has no power to carry out these deportations\.
### Germany

Due to “logistical” problems, Germany postponed a deportation flight to Afghanistan on Tuesday, according to [InfoMigrants](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/31960/germany-scraps-deportation-flight-to-afghanistan?fbclid=IwAR2eWGPrLnBXx_AY6_JBSc-XQio8P_m-FVmy7wba8ufrQXyRTTdZDv8pAqU) \. Officials said that increased security requirements made deportation flights impossible until 6th May\. Human Rights groups urge the government to stop all deportations to the country\.

A resident of an accomodation center in Gudow near Hamburg is suspected of arson at the facility on Saturday, InfoMigrants [writes](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/31967/fire-destroys-asylum-seekers-accommodation-in-northern-germany?fbclid=IwAR3Nixbd1IRxfcW33ZX5pcAZRndkLPjRo4w-s-Xow4Mi2UvI64eQckb8wcY) \. None of the 21 residents nor the staff were injured, but the building was destroyed\. It was the second fire in an accomodation center this year\.
### San Marino

San Marino has approved a legislation allowing families and single persons to host unaccompanied minors living in accomodation centers, InfoMigrants [writes](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/31968/san-marino-approves-legislation-to-host-unaccompanied-minors?fbclid=IwAR3ZVnP5zTJ1RzzumBwai68r_lvlttr_4xzpfjFIeYYzLSv0Q7VTmUv4YEM) \. Requirements inlcude to be older than 25 years, to be able to educate and support the young person, and support contact with the family of origin, if possible\. Reportedly, foster care from the Greek islands should also be possible\.
