### Another refugee dies near Calais

This morning near Calais a man in his thirties died inside a lorry after the driver lost control of the vehicle\. After first reports of an Erithrean refugee, l’Auberge des Migrants and police sources have now said it was an Afghan refugee according to [La Voix du Nord](http://www.lavoixdunord.fr/288325/article/2017-12-29/accident-mortel-sur-l-a26-le-chauffeur-surpris-par-le-geste-du-migrant) \.

Help Refugees reminds us that last week a 15\-year\-old child was killed in a hit\-and\-run incident on the motorway\. He had been formally referred to the state child protection services as vulnerable, and as a potential family reunification case, but no action was taken\.

A few days ago, a 22\-year old young man was also involved in a car crash near Grande Synthe which has left him fighting for his life in hospital\.

Help Refugees says:


> These tragic deaths were entirely preventable\. The emergency accommodation in Calais remains closed, as the local authorities have deemed it insufficiently cold\. The Dublin III family reunification procedure currently takes an average of nine months\. The Dubs Amendment for unaccompanied children is stalled\. The French and British Governments have a duty to protect Europe’s most vulnerable, but are failing to meet the most basic and causing unnecessary tragic deaths at our border\. 





L’Auberge des Migrants adds that the number of refugees living in Calais has steadily increased since the beginning of the year, from 100 in January to 500 in December\. It adds that they are mostly in the region because they cannot seek asylum in France, as the government measures do not work, with refugees forced to give their fingerprints and therefore likely to be sent back to Italy, Bulgaria and other countries\. Police is systematically tracking refugees and destroying their belongings while they take enormous risks each night to cross the border\.

Calais is not the only region where these tragic deaths happen: In the Alpes\-Maritimes region at the border with Italy, 15 refugees have died since September 2016, with the latest falling to his death near the highway last Wednesday according to [France 3](https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/provence-alpes-cote-d-azur/alpes-maritimes/menton/roquebrune-cap-martin-migrant-retrouve-mort-au-bord-a8-apres-chute-1391603.html)

A vigil will be held for the latest victim this Saturday at 18:30 in front of Richelieu park in Calais\.
### Help Refugees calls on authorities to open emergency accommodation centres

Help Refugees also calls on authorities to reopen the emergency accommodation centres in Calais which could shelter 260 people and has provided a [template email](https://www.facebook.com/HelpRefugeesUK/photos/a.123267671367248.1073741830.111893659171316/543386972688647/?type=3&theater) to send to the local Prefecture\. The Refugee Info Bus notes that authorities argued it is “not cold enough” to open the centres, despite freezing winds and heavy rain forecast overnight\.

### Man drowns trying to cross the Evros river

### Migration ministry blames local authorities for conditions on islands

[Ekathimerini](http://www.ekathimerini.com/224504/article/ekathimerini/news/migration-ministry-responds-to-criticism-over-island-camps) also says the Migration Ministry has blamed local authorities for the grim conditions inside island refugee camps, after criticism from the EU’s special envoy on migration, Maarten Verwey\. Verwey had said that the European Commission made funding available to ensure appropriate accommodation for all\. “ _However, the Commission cannot order the creation or expansion of reception capacity against the opposition of the competent authorities,_ ” he added\.

### No Name Kitchen responds to accusations of being the root cause behind Christmas protests

[No Name Kitchen](http://www.nonamekitchen.org/en/criminalizing-humanitarian-aid/) writes about the aftermath of the Christmas protests at the border with Croatia\. It says it reacted to this emergency situation and asked the Serbian police whether their could satisfy their basic needs: tents, food, water, basic medical treatments\. A demand that was accepted\.

However, the Commissariat for Refugees \(KIRS\), the organisation responsible for refugee care, soon accused them in several media of being the root cause of the protest:


> According to them, we made everyone believe the borders would be open because it was Christmas\. It’s not true\. We just offered our help when we realized that a lot of families would sleep outside with nothing to protect them from the cold and the police allowed us to\. We gave them hot food, blankets and tents\. We are very disappointed to see an organisation with such responsibility in this humanitarian crisis that Europe is experiencing, assuming the refugees don’t have the capacity of thinking for themselves and self\-organizing\. We should not forget that, even though some people see them as disabled, they are people who invested their lifetime savings to put on a backpack and travel across half the world with the hope of a better future\.
