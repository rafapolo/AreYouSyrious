#### Police violence during flight boarding to Lesvos/ Rainfalls in Bosnia / Police violence in Morocco / Protest against deportations in London
### Greece

The brother of photographer Arash Hampay, was reportedly kicked and pushed by a police officer at Athens airport, as he was checking in to board a flight to Lesvos\. Video footage released by Hampay shows the incident, which led to an urgent internal investigation by the Greek police, [according](https://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2019/07/29/police-kicks-foreign-passenger-athens-airport-video) to Keep Talking Greece\. 
The news blog also refers to Greek media quoting police sources saying that, “the officer stopped the man to check his papers\. The latter \[Hampay’s brother\] pushed him away\. probably because he was drunk, and then the police officer kicked him as shown in the video\.” Although the kick cannot be verified in this video, he is clearly pushed\. An onlooker in the video even asks the airport staff why this police officer pushing this man\.
