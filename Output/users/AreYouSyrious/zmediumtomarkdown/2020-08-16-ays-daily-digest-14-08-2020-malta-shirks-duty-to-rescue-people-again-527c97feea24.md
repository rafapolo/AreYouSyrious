#### Malta Ignores Duty to Rescue Those in Distress… Again

After [yesterday’s feature](ays-daily-digest-13-08-2020-maltas-authorities-once-again-denied-rescue-7d604890bad4) , we bring another story about Maltese authorities refusing to rescue people\. Early on Friday morning, AlarmPhone [posted](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1294153894390566912) that they were contacted overnight by a boat in distress in the Maltese SAR zone\. Approximately eleven people on board had fled from Libya\.

Later, AlarmPhone were contacted by a relative of someone on board, who said the people reached Sicily safely after the Armed Forces of Malta provided [the people with fuel](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1294335951263666178) \. Their duty was to rescue the people in distress, not send them on a longer journey\.

This pattern of ignoring rescues or pushing them towards Italy or Libya is a violation of international law, which obliges country to rescue ships in distress that are in their SAR\. Additionally, it could cause a diplomatic incident with Italy\. [A similar inciden](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/20/we-give-you-30-minutes-malta-turns-migrant-boat-away-with-directions-to-italy) t occurred in May, when a Maltese navy vessel refused to rescue a boat in distress and gave them fuel and directions to Italy instead\. That incident caused tension between the two states, and this one might as well\. The Maltese government often calls for more European solidarity, but these actions are not likely to endear them to fellow European states, or anybody who cares about basic human rights\.

Meanwhile, 27 people are still on the [merchant ship Etienne](https://twitter.com/seawatch_intl/status/1294244175127379971?fbclid=IwAR0zWXOXxVDz9WSIOCzPX_h3gnVYqhIQUYzuzZgG6GecD1I2YwdgLrwDeis) , 10 days after they were rescued by the cargo ship in the Maltese SAR zone\. Malta is refusing them permission to enter port\. It is unacceptable to play with people’s lives like this, stranding them at sea over and over again\!

#### Assad’s Regime Goes After Palestinians

Yarmouk refugee camp in Damascus was once a vital center for the Palestinian diaspora, but after its destruction during the war, occupation by ISIS and the displacement of many of its residents, its erasure may become permanent as the government is looking to redevelop the area\. You can read more about this [here](https://english.alaraby.co.uk/english/indepth/2020/8/14/the-erasure-of-yarmouk-refugee-camp?fbclid=IwAR2OXNS6_ISqjf6xqsAvovC5Fg7IDyaYVdp7xQUzSzYv6yTeEKWI9SxOVMU) , from _Al Araby_ \.

#### Updates from Vial Camp on Chios

As we reported yesterday, Vial Camp on Chios has been put on lockdown until 25 August because two people tested positive for COVID\-19\. However, it is impossible for people to protect themselves inside the camp due to the overcrowding and lack of access to water and protective equipment\.

There are [reports of protests](https://www.facebook.com/smhumanitario/posts/3238263316265496) and clashes in the camp in response to the lockdown conditions\. People are more than right to be angry since very little concern is paid to their health\. The above photo came from a camp resident, who showed how the food distribution lines were poorly organized despite lobbying to find a different, more socially distanced solution\. They also had [this to say](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=3756858060997741&set=a.279309615419287) :


> No one took any attention of us\. They think we are animals, without any mind\! 





> Just imagine if you were in our place\. 





> I am worried for my mother, she has diabetes, a heart condition and breathing problem\. My mother was registered by the authorities as a vulnerable case, but they didn’t do anything for her\. 





> There are many vulnerable people like my mother\. 





> When we ask them to do something they just say ‘we can’t\.’ 





> If they can’t then who can?\!’
