### Italy

The Italian Coast Guard ship Diciotti arrived in the port of Catania today\. The boat is carrying 177 refugees, who have been trapped at sea for four days now\. Despite landing, Italian interior minister Matteo Salvini refused to allow the people aboard to disembark, demanding that they be distributed among EU member states\. EU officials in Bruseels claim to be currently in negotiations with Italy\. As politicians negotiate, people who have endured terrible conditions in Libya wait on the crowded deck of Diciotti\.

The racism of the Italian government is resulting in hundreds of deaths\. Soon, it may become thousands\. As rescue ships are becoming tangled up in negotiations simply to land, or impounded by EU governments, the crossing has become extremely dangerous\. So far this year, over 1,500 people have drowned in the Mediterranean while trying to reach a place of safety\.
### Sea

With four civil rescue ships still impounded, the Sea\-Watch NGO released a statement today reminding everyone of the crucial work these rescue ships are doing each day\. Despite continued harassment of aid workers, a total of 5,262 people were saved from the Mediterranean sea in the first three weeks of August alone\. As Sea\-Watch wrote,


> It’s despair and not a fictional pull\-factor that is causing people to take this dangerous journey… Distress at sea persists, and the decreasing number of rescuers is putting lives at risk\!

#### School Opens on Samos

While the refugee camp on Samos has only become more overcrowded in the past months, with very few people being moved off the island, there are some positive stories to tell\. An education center has opened on the island, focusing on teens and children\. The center, run by the [Still I Rise](https://www.facebook.com/pg/stilliriseNGO/posts/?ref=page_internal) NGO, only opened up this month but it is already enrolling hundreds of children\.

Despite EU law that every child has the right to an education, Greece provides education to almost no refugee children\. The number of refugee children who are allowed to attend Greek school on the Aegean islands can usually be counted on one hand at any given time\. The UNHCR has failed to advocate for refugee children in this regard\. While many volunteer groups and community centers across Greece are working to provide education for refugee children, these programs typically fall short of being full time schools\.

Yet in the face of institutional failure, certain people stand up\. The Still I Rise education center, called “Mazi,” is working to provide a full\-time, regular schooling program for refugee children and adolescents\. The program not only covers normal school subjects, but adresses social and psychological issues, and aims to empower refugee youth\. You can support the project here\.

It has been reported that last week, the memorial to those who lost their lives at sea was vandalized on Lesvos\. This is the second time the memorial has been attacked\.
#### The Moria detention camp is more crowded than ever

Today the Hope Project on Lesvos posted a video showing conditions inside the Moria camp on Lesvos, where over 10,000 people are now detained\. You can watch it [here](https://www.facebook.com/HopeProjectKempsons/videos/280420849452027/) \. Sometime this week, Refugee Rights Europe will be releasing a report on conditions in the Moria camp\. Among the findings they have already published are the fact that 47\.4% of residents in the camp have been victims of police violence\. Out of the people reporting police violence, 84\.9% described being exposed to tear gas at least once\.

### Austria
#### Austrian Citizens Pay Steep Price for Border Police

The Austrian effort to militarize the 160km border between the country and Slovenia has cost Austrian taxpayers over 40 millions euros a year to maintain\. Despite a slight decrease in the number of people crossing the border, the far\-right Austrian government has made this border a prominent issue\. In the first half of 2017, border police apprehended 10 people\. If you divide this by Austria’s budget for the border, it equals two million Euros spent per apprehended person\.
### France

#### Refugee Rights Europe reports from Calais

The Refugee Rights organization, which has produced a number of detailed reports on the situation for refugees in France, returned from a brief trip to Calais his weekend\. They interviewed refugees in the region, and documented instances of border violence, and the failure of the municipality to provide health services to refugees there\. As RRE wrote,


> We deeply lament the situation and call on French and British governments to seek a sustainable and humane solution, to meet basic humanitarian requirements, and to adopt a non\-violent approach as the default position\. 





A cycle of displacement and return has been going on in Calais since the destruction of the “jungle” camp\. Police often destroy the tents and belongings of refugees in the area, and people are then sent on buses to far away locations, where they often don’t know anyone and have no access to services\. This results in a people slowly returning to Calais, beginning yet another cycle of eviction\.

An independent volunteer who visited the area gave [her own assesmen](https://www.facebook.com/humanaidgreece/posts/583036128758442) t this weekend\- “The Dunkirk camp is hell on earth\. 800 people, including 100 small children live there in awful conditions\. A tarpaulin and some blankets stretched between the trees, a tent for the lucky ones, no or very limited access to water and toilets\. When I was last in Dunkirk there were 1 water point and 3 latrines for the whole camp, and they have been taken away since\.”

During Macron’s presidential campaign, and his first months in office, the French PM promised to get all refugees off the streets and into safe accomodation by the year 2018\. Instead, it seems French authorities are more focused on keeping refugees out of sight\.
### Spain
#### Rescued refugees left on street upon arrival
