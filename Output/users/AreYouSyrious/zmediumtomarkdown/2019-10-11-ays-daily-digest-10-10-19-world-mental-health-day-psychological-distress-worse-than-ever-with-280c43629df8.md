#### More human suffering adding new displacement to what is already the largest displacement crisis in the world

Although the Nato’s secretary general and the EC president [appealed](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-security-eu/eus-juncker-urges-turkey-to-halt-military-operation-in-syria-idUSKBN1WO1TD) to Turkey to avoid adding to the instability in Syria, without anyone’s direct opposition, as everyone knows, Turkey has invaded Syria\. Reportedly, among others, they are bombing Mansoura Dam in Derik which provides 2 million people with drinking water\. According to the statistics of the SOHR, the number of displaced people has exceeded 70,000 people\.

Reportedly, the **aid workers said they had been told to leave by their organisations, and most had done so reluctantly,** thus leaving unsupported the thousands of people who have been displaced multiple times during the war in Syria, having survived unsurmountable atrocities and violence\.


> In addition to the Syrian civilians in the north\-east, there are thousands of women and children living in camps across the area … who rely completely and exclusively on humanitarian aid\. Any interruption to camp services which are already overstretched would put their lives at risk\. — _Save the Children_ 





**Demonstrations and signs of opposition to the attack are present in different areas:**

In the UK, protesters in Bristol have blocked the entrance to BAE Filton, shutting down multiple businesses who trade with Turkey:

#### GREECE

Despite a growing body of research on how displacement impacts mental health, many people live in squalid conditions and with no to scant mental health resources\.

People stacked among trees and reeds, fields full of dirt, plastic and paper, children in the mud and soil, a sharp smell of sewage running through broken pipes, and hundreds of people scattered around private properties in the surrounding area, these are all scenes that have become more and more permanent and tragic, every day, away from the spotlights on the islands of Lesvos and Samos, [media reporters note](https://www.politischios.gr/koinonia/bi-al-otan-oi-lexeis-khanoun-to-noema-tous-mprosta-sten-eikona?fbclid=IwAR1vI1EucRcnD1TjccYIb1xCOWxKydwsdm5XfKYz_Um7rrW9Lg24meCphKg) \.

Roughly 57 % of all refugees and migrants that reached Europe in 2019 so far arrived in Greece, InfoRefugees [report](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FInfoMigrants%2Fstatus%2F1182256712750784512%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR3-J7Ukt09xlcPbQkLjYjHjKVpZ9fDUr8pt5JwPdWuuJLW6hywxUOviqTc&h=AT3H8_oRl2Ng82nJ2gWpd3j_I_sLh9GBqsMwQ9qNHBJKaxIoMG4iOjV356XUHHogH_KXyT4wU9FoA3XgyQpKQgHWeOjU2QVy07x-M8EojQss6r2yiZIXKdS6G30Ndi_vPVFqgRe123P4Tw) \. The month September had 55 landings of boats that had 1881 newly arrived people\. Arrivals are still in rise\.

The psychological distress is worsening for 12,800 children, women, and men who face overcrowded conditions in Moria\. Reportedly, only five schools in Mytilene received refugee children into schools for secondary education\.
### ECHR decides on the detention of unaccompanied minors

The ARISIS\-Social Youth Support Organization filed the application for interim measures, complaining of “conditions that constitute inhuman and degrading treatment” in the case of the 20 young people detained on 20 September in AT Kolon — 14 of them were held for reasons of protective custody and 6 for administrative expulsion\.

The European Court of Human Rights today, on 10 October 2019, issued a ruling on interim measures pursuant to Article 39 of the European Convention on Human Rights \(ECHR\), in which it points out to the Greek Government:

• the transfer of unaccompanied minors detained to police stations and brought to the ECtHR in appropriate accommodation facilities;

• ensuring that the minors are accommodated in accordance with Article 3 of the ECHR and their special status\.

Furthermore, the ECtHR set a deadline for the Greek Government until 11:00 tomorrow to reply:

• Conditions of detention of unaccompanied minors transferred from the Police Departments to the Pre\-Trial Detention Center in Amygdaleza and the impact of such detention on their psychosomatic development

• The actions of the Greek authorities for the transfer of the above minors to appropriate minors and their relative transfer time\.

In addition, the ECtHR seeks a response to the actions taken by the Authorities so far to appoint a Commissioner to all children who have applied to the ECtHR, and to ensure the reception of such children in accordance with Article 3 of the ECHR, including a child who has has already been transferred to a “safe zone” at the Reception Center in Ritsona Attica\.

ARISIS [says](https://www.efsyn.gr/ellada/dikaiomata/214244_asfalistika-metra-kata-tis-kratisis-asynodeyton-anilikon-apofasizei-edda) that in addition to the unaccompanied minors who are still detained in the Kolonos Police Department, many minors are also detained in other police stations, and in addition to the 70 unaccompanied minors still held in PROKEKA Amygdaleas\.
### Thessaloniki

Greek police [say](http://www.ekathimerini.com/245363/article/ekathimerini/news/vehicle-crammed-with-migrants-crashes-near-thessaloniki-3-dead?fbclid=IwAR3rsIp8BsfKYYsCJ58lfOHKetq02vUtiPmaNXdLv04XJ_cILdfEd9XIPyo) three people have been killed in northern Greece and another 12 were injured when “a vehicle crammed with migrants crashed into an oncoming car and fell off a cliff”\.

### RWC and Mobile Refugee Support’s urgent fundraiser

“We are collecting funds to buy tents and sleeping bags for displaced people sleeping rough in Grande\-Synthe\. Following the recent eviction and dispersal of around 1000 women, men and children from municipal shelter, hundreds have returned to the area\. Most are sleeping rough without any access to stable shelter, sanitation or safe drinking water\. The eviction, a very ’temporary’ intervention, has created great uncertainty for the community with many not knowing what will happen to them from one day to the next\.
It has also put an immense strain on aid organisations, who are working tirelessly to meet people’s needs\. The weather has taken a turn for the worse; it is windy, rainy and cold\. People are sleeping on wet ground\. Adults and children are wrapping themselves in cling film to stay warm\.


![](assets/280c43629df8/1*Yq_Qqg3pDmQs3Pby9YFmNQ.jpeg)


Since the eviction on the 27th of September RWC has distributed over 90 tents, an average of 6 tents a day, and of course this has rapidly exhausted our stock\.”

**£8 can buy a 1\-man tent\.** 
**£18 can buy a 4\-man tent\.** 
**£14 can buy a winter sleeping bag**
