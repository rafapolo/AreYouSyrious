### Feature

Following an unannounced trip by Prime Minister Robert Abela, Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri and Foreign Affairs Minister Evarist Bartolo to Tripoli, the Maltese government have announced that they will be working with their Libyan counterparts to set up units to coordinate operations against illegal migration\.

During the meeting, both leaders spoke about the need to strengthen cooperation to ensure that lives are not lost at sea and to combat human traffickers on the ground and at sea\. [_The Times of Malta_ reports](https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/abela-ministers-return-from-libya-after-positive-migration-talks.794840?fbclid=IwAR0ksRRh_voEUzpy5dBzjAhMhjbhGkN_49Q2juuwwkRrJOT8_5PNdFupkI0) that discussions centred on the need for the EU to train the Libyan coastguard further, obtaining funding for reception camps operated by the UN, as well as to build a realistic strategy to slow down the flow of migrants into Libya\.

The strengthening of relationships between Malta and Libya should be viewed with some scepticism\. Both countries have been plagued by [allegations of human rights violations and illegal pushbacks](https://www.ecre.org/med-continued-violations-topped-with-dodgy-deals/?fbclid=IwAR25aK4blgSQCYCt-75Tm4HSiQAgtC0e0g7rGj6jfISMQa-Pei1zk9KaCtg) \. On Wednesday the IOM confirmed that Malta garnered the assistance of a German commercial ship under a Portuguese flag, to return 98 people to war\-torn Libya\. The UN confirmed that, in an unrelated incident, two of the 315 people that had been ‘rescued’ some days prior and returned to Tripoli had died\.

For the refugees who are apprehended and not returned to Libya, hundreds are now being held ‘ [hostage](https://twitter.com/JFCrisp/status/1265549147534393344) ’ on the Captain Morgan vessel outside Maltese territorial waters\. The current number of people being held on this boat is 425\. Amnesty International stated in an open letter to the Maltese Prime Minister, _“Nothing can justify holding people for days without legal basis and in inadequate conditions\. Ferry boats are not suited for long stays nor can they cater for the needs of people rescued at sea\. The need to avoid the spreading of Covid\-19 is no excuse to impose unnecessary, inhumane and discriminatory measures against traumatized people, such as denying their disembarkation\. Lack of solidarity by other EU Member States cannot justify their arbitrary detention either\.”_

Following an incident in which the Maltese armed forces turned away at gunpoint a small rubber boat carrying 101 migrants & refugees, and thereby prevented them from entering Maltese waters, [Italy is now considering to open an investigation against Malta](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/29/italy-considers-charges-over-maltas-shocking-refusal-to-rescue-migrants?fbclid=IwAR2_5dxbosZ4ClcML6Zz05Y24VtAvZB-G64PetdGCd9gIDNh-nK1Zp6a0jk#maincontent) \. On Thursday the Italian government released a new report that confirms the behaviour of the Maltese government and states: _“The conduct of the Maltese authorities in this circumstance is in line with an unfortunately not new attitude on the part of Valletta\.’’_ \. The report adds that the “ _Maltese authorities have often evaded the obligations set out in international conventions on the subject of rescue at sea”\._ The Guardian approached the Maltese armed forces and government for a comment but they have yet to respond\.
### Greece

Aegean Boat Report have recorded another incident of an illegal pushback by the Greek coast guard of a boat carrying approximately 40 people\.

Equal Rights Beyond Borders shared a new report that shows that Greece and the EU are grossly unprepared for an outbreak of Covid\-19 in the Vial refugee camp, on Chios island\. The report cites ‘critical shortages of water, sanitary facilities and medical services’; ‘elderly and immuno\-compromised individuals living in the camp without proper areas to isolate’; and ‘overcrowding that makes social distancing impossible\.’

[Refugees who have received international](https://greekhelsinki.wordpress.com/2020/05/29/2-101/?fbclid=IwAR1e84krQFOB1XTjv9yxUj-QeqFD3o5fMjnPAlqjHBD0jGNILiCnKW6zX_c) protection are being forced to leave apartments for vulnerable people in the Emergency Support to Integration & Accommodation programme \(ESTIA\), hotels under the Temporary Shelter and Protection programme \(FILOXENIA\), Reception and Identification Centres \(RICs\) and refugee camps\. Almost simultaneously, financial assistance in the form of EU implemented and supported cash cards will stop\. These upcoming measures will affect the livelihood of at least 4,800 people who need to leave ESTIA accommodation, 3,500 people who need to leave RICs and hosting facilities, as well as 1,200 refugees who are self\-accommodated and receive cash assistance\.
