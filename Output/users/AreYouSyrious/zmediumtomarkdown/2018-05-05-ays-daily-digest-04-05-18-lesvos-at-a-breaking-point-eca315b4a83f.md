#### Feature

58 people arrived on Lesvos and 46 people on Samos\. Aegean Boat Report says one boat with 31 people was picked up by the Greek coastguard outside Farmakonisi and transported to Leros\.

The [Aegean Boat Report](https://www.facebook.com/AegeanBoatReport/) says that a total of 418 people arrived on Samos in April, while only 185 were transferred to the mainland \(195 according to UNHCR\) \. Samos Volunteers says that there are now close to 2,200 refugees on Samos, of which more than 1900 are staying in the Vathy camp, designed with a maximum capacity of 700\. The UNHCR says that numbers have dropped compared to March, with 544 arrivals\. However, given the importance of seasons and weather in crossing the sea, looking at the same month last year might give an even better indication: In April last year, only 243 people arrived on Samos\.

On Lesvos the situation is similar\. A total of 1,807 new people arrived, while only 1,237 were transferred to the mainland\. More than 7,000 people are now living in Moria, in a camp initially built for a maximum of 2,500 people\. [MSF](http://www.msf.org/en/article/greece-overcrowded-dangerous-and-insufficient-access-healthcare-moria) warns that the situation on Lesvos is reaching breaking point as people are living in squalid, overcrowded conditions, with insufficient access to health care\. It calls on the Greek authorities to immediately transfer people from Lesvos to the mainland\.

The IOM meanwhile has said that more than 10,000 people have returned home from Greece over the last 20 months\.

Help Refugees is continuing its campaign to at least improve somewhat the living conditions in refugee camps during Ramadan\. It is [asking for donations](https://donate.helprefugees.org/campaigns/ramadan-2018/) to provide food for over 12,000 refugees during Ramadan for people in Moria, in the One Happy Family community centre on Lesvos, and in seven camps across Northern Greece\.
### Information for refugees in Greece

Our friend Rando Wagner has posted the following information for refugees who may be hesitant to ask for asylum when this is offered\. The following does not apply to anyone who is lodging a second asylum appeal in an EU country after already being given asylum status in another one:

“If while travelling through EU countries on your way to your final destination you get arrested by the police / border control and they ask you if you want to ask for asylum DO IT please\. Otherwise the police has no choice but to arrest you and charge you with being illegally in their country and if you are using a fake travel document, they will also charge you for this offence\.

Asking for asylum does NOT equal having asylum, in most countries it takes many months if not years\. All it means is that you are registered and legally in the country, you can continue your journey to your final destination but your data will be entered in the same data base as above\.

The bottom line is once you get arrested and fingerprinted whether you ask for asylum or not, your final destination country can legally deport you to the EU country which first registered you\. In some cases they do this and in some they don’t\. It’s not based on the rule of law, but on a case to case basis and no one can predict the outcome with certainty

Greece is a ‘special case’ and to this day I have not heard of a single case where a refugee who was simply registered for asylum in Greece was deported there, apart from a few individuals who crossed by ferry from Patra to Italy, but they all refused to ask for asylum in Italy when stopped by the Italian border police\.

European asylum law is a complete mess, and each case is different, hence I have long ago stopped dissuading anyone from attempting to reach their intended destination, even though according to EU law they should stand no chance\. Anything is possible these days, but it’s nearly certain, in most countries, that failing to ask for asylum will either result in a push back or a criminal conviction\.

The chances of not being deported are the same regardless of the reason for the ‘fingerprint’ \( asylum request, criminal record etc \)”\.

**Information on kindergarten and primary school enrollment**

Refugee\.Info has published information on kindergarten and primary school enrollment for refugees on their [website](https://www.refugee.info/greece/education--greece/special-school-program-for-refugees-6-to-15) \. The information is available in English, Arabic, Farsi, Urdu and French\.

**Information on losing asylum\-seeker white card**

Mobile Info Team has published information on what to do when losing the [asylum seeker white card](https://www.facebook.com/mobileinfoteam/photos/a.1800063030222418.1073741830.1796286800600041/2165305567031494/?type=3&theater) \.
#### Sea
### Route to Spain has become the deadliest one

Salvamento Maritimo says 307 people were rescued from eight boats in the sea between Morocco and Spain\. This comes as IOM says that this route has become the deadliest in the world, with one out of 29 people dying while trying to cross the sea\. So far this year, 217 people have died\. In the Central Mediterrenean, one out of 36 people die while trying to cross\. So far this year, 615 people have died on this route\.

Seawatch’s Moonbird is taking off again after 1\.5 weeks of bad weather and is now patrolling the area in the west of the search and rescue zone\. Seawatch says that the waves are still dangerous, but that people are embarking even in bad weather after such a long time without a chance to leave Libya\. [MSF](https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/libya-time-running-out-hundreds-migrants-and-refugees-dangerously-overcrowded-detention) argues that “time is running out” for hundreds of refugees in the port city of Zuwara, Libya\. Roughly 800 people are detained there, including 500 in the last 15 days:


> “The number held far exceeds the center’s capacity, with floor space so limited it is barely possible to lie down” 




#### Sweden
### More restrictive migration policies planned in Sweden

[Sveriges Radio](https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=83&artikel=6946379) reports the “Social Democrats” are planning more restrictive migration policies ahead of elections this fall\. In 2017 Sweden received around 27,000 people, which according to Helene Fritzon, Minister of Migration, is too many in relation to Sweden’s population of about 10 million people\. According to her, 14,000 is a more reasonable number per year\. The government also wants to extend internal border controls, which according to EU legislation will end in November 2018\.

They also want to make it harder for people to arrange their own housing through friends and relatives, something that makes it harder to trace people after negative asylum decisions, as AYS has mentioned previously\. The relatively new law that made it possible for migrants to arrange their own accommodation will be limited\.

Instead, there will be more centralized and monitored accommodations\. It will become possible to put more people in detention and the time\-limit to apply for asylum again will be doubled, from 4 to 8 years\. As of now, a lot of people are living hidden for four years before applying again\.
#### Serbia
### Medical volunteers needed

Medvint needs [medical volunteers](https://medvint.org/volunteering/) for its projects in Bosnia and Serbia\. Other volunteering opportunities can be found on [Greecevol](https://www.greecevol.info/) \.
#### Bulgaria
### Degrading living conditions reported by anti\-torture committee

The Council of Europe’s anti\-torture committee says it has received allegations of physical ill\-treatment by custodial staff at the Lyubimets detention centre\. It also noted dilapidated, filthy, and crammed dormitories and says absolutely nothing was provided for more than 40 minors accompanying their parents\.
