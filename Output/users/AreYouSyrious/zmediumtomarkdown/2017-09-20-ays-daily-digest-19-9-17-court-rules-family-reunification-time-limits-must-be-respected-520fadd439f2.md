### FEATURE: German court rules on Dublin\-defined family reunification

An immediate end to the limitation of Dublin transfers in the case of family reunifications from Greece to Germany—something many had hoped for—will finally come to pass\.

The right to Dublin\-defined family reunification during the defined 6 months period must be respected, a German court has ruled\.

■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 


This year, in April 2017, the German Interior Ministry drastically limited the number of family reunification transfers from Greece to Germany\. This number is now limited to 70 people per month, which has resulted in long and ever\-increasing waiting times for many applicants who have already been approved\. Due to this agreement, grandparents, fathers, mothers, and children have been waiting to join each other for years\.

At the end of May, T [he Mobile Info Team](https://www.facebook.com/mobileinfoteam/) initiated [the petition](https://mobileinfoteam.blogspot.gr/2017/05/sign-this-petition-to-support-refugees.html) against this decision which has been signed by over 25,000 people so far\. Unfortunately, not much has changed since then\.

The German Interior Ministry, which is responsible for the restriction, justifies this policy by pointing to the logistic problems and claiming there are not enough reception places to host additional people\. However, according to the Mobile Info Team, reception centers in Germany are half\-empty and the country can handle around 800,000 people\.

**“The right to family unity has to be respected\. Families should be able to care for each other in times of illness and to be together in times of grief,”** 
ProAsyl, Germany’s largest refugee support organization, said earlier\.

Prosyl also called for the respect of the best interest of the child during family reunion and the possibility for underage siblings of minors living in Germany to join their parents and be transferred together\. With the legal support they’ve received, these demands are closer to becoming practice\.

The number of 70 people per month who are accepted to enter Germany from Greece on the basis of family reunification is a result of a bilateral agreement and is not aligned with any EU legislative\. This ruling on the individual case is important because it challenges the legality of the entire practice and sets up a strong basis for other future legal battles\.

Even today, people who are waiting for the relocation, protested in the front of the Germany embassy in Athens\.

The Libyan Coast Guard’s interception of 816 people last weekend in Al\-Zawya again shows that aid agencies are prevented from getting the systematic access they seek and need\.

#### GREECE
### Latest arrivals

144 people were officially registered today: 85 on Chios, 45 on
Samos, 12 on Kos and 4 on other Aegean islands\.
46 people arrived in a boat to Samos today\.
### Borderline explosive situation in Lesvos

With more than 6,000 people in the facilities on the island, a steady increase in arrivals and poor politics regarding relocation and care for the people stranded on the island, the mayor of Lesvos wrote an open letter to minister Mouzalas and European Migration Affairs Commissioner Avramopoulos\.


> “The avoidance of measures until conditions worsen to such an extent that we have another crisis on our hands cannot be tolerated, under any circumstances, by the local community,” _the letter says, among other things\._

> **[Choose Love](https://twitter.com/chooselove) @ Twitter Says:**

Concerns are peaking again about the situation on the islands of the eastern Aegean, as some 2,300 undocumented migrants have arrived from neighboring Turkey in the past two weeks alone, Greek media [report](http://www.ekathimerini.com/221767/article/ekathimerini/news/renewed-influx-of-migrants-to-islands-a-concern?fref=gc&dti=1652972374920129) \.

Meanwhile the rate of returns to Turkey of migrants whose asylum applications have been rejected is very slow, largely because many of them appeal against rejections in a bid to postpone their deportation, Ekathimerini [reports](http://www.ekathimerini.com/221767/article/ekathimerini/news/renewed-influx-of-migrants-to-islands-a-concern?fref=gc&dti=1652972374920129) \.

### Chios


> “While Souda Camp has never been a humane or suitable living environment for people, we are concerned that the remote location of Vial and a lack of sufficient transport provision will increase the isolation of displaced people and the detrimental impact of that, and limit residents’ ability to access necessary support services; educational, medical, legal, psychosocial, and activity\-based services available in Chios Town\. The closure of _any_ camp is only a positive step if living conditions and facilities are improved as a result and that is yet to be seen”, _says [Dråpen i Havet](https://www.facebook.com/drapenihavet/?hc_ref=ARRkijphh73fntbP6SNSMhnq_uVJR0iWorUu22KFMI4lnW4wRiHHl5G0nuk_9zkdXnk&fref=nf) Head of Operations_ 





About a hundred people was transferred from Souda by buses today\.

Transfers from islands to mainland remain high\. On 17\.9 less than 13\.000 people were accomodated on the islands\. Due to the the new arrivals two days ago it was slightly more yesterday\.

#### ROMANIA
### A new route?

Last week, a small boat carrying 157 migrants from Iraq and Iran was found off the Romanian coast\. The coast guard also intercepted a boat with 97 migrants, including 36 children\. Another fishing boat carrying 87 migrants was also discovered on September 3\.
The influx has ignited fears that Turkish smugglers are opening up a new route for illegal entry into the European Union, media [report](https://www.neweurope.eu/article/romania-braces-migrant-influx/) \.
 2,800 migrants were caught trying to illegally enter the country since the start of this year\. This is an increase of 1,624 compared to the whole of 2016\.

#### FRANCE
### Evacuation in Grande\-Synthe

In the early hours of this morning, police operation is underway at the Puythouck camp, where between 400 and 420 migrants have lived since the fire at the Linière camp in April\. French authorities and police forcibly evicted the settlement at Grande\-Synthe in the Dunkirk area\.

The entire camp was cleared and the refugees living there were put onto buses to be taken to accommodation centres \(CAOs\) in 10 different regions around the country\.


> “At the last count there were 56 children present and around 40 women\. I can’t let this situation go on anymore,” _the mayor [said](https://www.thelocal.fr/20170919/france-clears-hundreds-of-migrants-from-wood-near-calais) on Monday before the operation\._ 





After several weeks of “peace”, the camp was heavily built up and developed, making the sudden eviction all the more devastating, the volunteers say\.
