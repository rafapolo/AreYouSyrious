### FEATURE — Coronavirus Tears Through German Reception Center

The epidemic has gripped a reception center for people on the move in the southern German town of Ellwangen\. Out of 567 residents, [244 people](https://www.swr.de/swraktuell/baden-wuerttemberg/mehr-infizierte-in-lea-ellwangen-100.html?fbclid=IwAR0XouJWTsXBx_Ny2S5PCVGXHqawoXofWCjspsWdT4TRiT1ox7YjwksNY2A) tested positive for COVID\-19 — almost half of the population\.

The first positive test in the facility was discovered on April 2nd\. Shortly after, six more people tested positive and all were immediately placed in a separate quarantine area within the facility\. By April 5th, the whole facility was placed under quarantine and nobody was allowed to leave the compound any more\. The isolation order is enforced by the police\.

Beginning on April 6th, all residents and staff were tested and the results were published on April 11th\. Previously, the German authorities planned to confine all infected refugees in a special facility in Althutte; two mothers with children were transferred there from Ellwangen\. However, the Althutte facility only has the capacity for 30–60 residents, so the majority of the people who tested positive at Ellwangen will stay in the same facility as those who tested negative\. They are kept in separate wings and the government will conduct follow\-up tests in a few days, however, there is a high possibility of new infections happening\.

Those who are stuck inside Ellwangen are isolated and scared, according to [reports](https://refugees4refugees.wordpress.com/2020/04/13/corona-chaos-in-ellwangen/?fbclid=IwAR3oLePn17NxwJyZ1xAN_jO3Ct8vVcz0QvajdnIOvSZRTT2WhWbWBkrQPtw) from a local support group\. Whole wings that contain residents that tested positive are isolated, but people have not received their individual test results\. Residents of the reception center do not even know if they’re sick or not — all they know is that they are confined in close quarters with someone suffering from a very contagious disease\.


> They have not received any protective equipment or sanitizer\. They are also cut off from the outside world physically via the police cordon and virtually — the only space with Wi\-Fi inside the center is by the kitchen, which people in isolation cannot access\. 




The government, especially the local city authorities, are congratulating themselves on their response, which mostly consists of placing police in front of the center to prevent people from leaving\. One official was quoted as saying, “We will arrange whatever is necessary to prevent the general public from health risks\.” The priority is not preventing spread within the center or ensuring a high standard of care for refugees who get sick, but making sure that Germans stay healthy\.

Whatever happens to the people inside the reception center in Ellwangen does not matter to the authorities\.
#### TURKEY
### People Released from Quarantine Camps Into Uncertainty

The group of people who were initially in Evros were finally released from coronavirus quarantine camps, but they are still far from safe\. Some [reported](https://www.facebook.com/humanstoriesgr/photos/a.1479805312047648/3599809923380499/?type=3&theater) that the Turkish government tried to force them to cross into Greece by sea\. They refused out of fear of violent pushbacks at sea and conditions at Greek camps\. For too long, they were stranded in Izmir and other places along the Turkish coast with no way to move \(bus drivers were charging three times the normal ticket price\) and cut off from outside help by the Turkish government\. Eventually, some were moved to Istanbul by the Turkish police while others who are still stranded in Izmir will [be transferred](https://twitter.com/g_christides/status/1249801943154917376) by a UNHCR bus convoy\.
#### SEA
### Aita Mari Rescues 47 People Stranded at Sea

Over the weekend, we reported on ships that were in distress in the Central Mediterranean with the full knowledge of the EU authorities, who did not conduct a rescue operation\.

The Spanish NGO boat Aita Mari was finally [granted permission](https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/spanish-ngo-intervenes-to-help-migrants-stranded-in-maltese-waters.785291?fbclid=IwAR2QB9-XOHFwJpMSs964YK6zqEO7K5_Xsz88FThJoDUsnxdZ3gyFCdZ35aE) early Monday morning to rescue one group of people stranded at sea, although they were not yet given permission to dock in Malta\. After water [began entering](https://www.facebook.com/smhumanitario/photos/a.921278434630674/2917291138362717/?type=3&theater) their dinghy, all of the rescued people were taken on board the Aita Mari, where they waited for further help while rough weather [rocked the seas](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2639348199628175) \. The people on board the rescued ship had been stranded at sea for four days, including at least one pregnant woman\. Audio of their distress calls can be found [here\.](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=546980222678887) Six people [lost consciousness](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157557114053621&set=a.10150438475713621&type=3&theater) while waiting to be rescued\.

Unfortunately, the Aita Mari did not have enough resources to properly help the people they rescued\. There was [no medic](https://www.facebook.com/seawatchprojekt/photos/a.1579563625595046/2515534935331239/?type=3&theater) on board and they only had half of their crew ready\. After the intervention of Mediterranea Saving Humans’ chaplain, who [contacted](https://newsbook.com.mt/en/they-will-drown-ngo-chaplain-tells-maltese-authorities/) Maltese Bishops to ask for their help, the Maltese army sent a patrol boat to help the Aita Mari\.


In regard to the other boats in distress spotted in the Central Mediterranean, Frontex said that two boats docked in Sicily while at least one more remains in Maltese SAR\. Alarmphone also reported that one boat remains in the area, but they [lost contact](https://www.facebook.com/watchthemed.alarmphone/photos/a.1526182797655958/2635247856749441/?type=3&theater) with it\. They are [working](https://www.facebook.com/watchthemed.alarmphone/photos/a.1526182797655958/2635549033385990/?type=3&theater) to determine how many other boats left Libya recently and are unaccounted for\. Frontex said they will continue to patrol the area, and independent reporters [confirmed](https://twitter.com/scandura/status/1249818368275812352?fbclid=IwAR1KY87UmYKWLGvUX4QjIerSBjIKX0QVkmuSlCEADdgrRKM9p7tUiJseO0o) that Maltese military planes were flying in Maltese SAR space tonight\. However, monitoring the situation is not enough — these people must be rescued\!

#### GREECE
### Coronavirus Hysteria Continues, So Does Inhumane Treatment

The Greek minister of immigration, Notis Mitarakis, formally [denied](https://www.corona24.news/u/2020/04/13/mitarakis-exposes-koumoutsakos-for-the-arrivals-of-refugees-with-a-crown-2.html) a rumor that Turkey was planning to send groups of people on the move that were carriers of COVID\-19 to Greece\. The rumor, which has no basis in truth, was spread by several pro\-government newspapers and even government officials, including Deputy Minister George Koumoutsakos\. The rumor was clearly designed to justify illegal pushbacks and violent treatment of people on the move\.

Instead of spreading lies, government officials should be more occupied with helping the vulnerable people they have abandoned to their fates\. Over a hundred people who have arrived on Lesvos since 14th March have been kept in makeshift [camps](https://mare-liberum.org/en/news/migrants-arriving-on-lesvos-in-state-of-exception) on the beach since then\. They do not have adequate housing, any toilets, showers, or protective equipment\. People who are already in Moria [cannot](https://twitter.com/PHupfen/status/1249657448757178369?fbclid=IwAR1MO__wiDP-Kk1enuzaFXbI3VacgckL8_Q2EKoD2nUdZsvNdPI8Xm3a-Ik) withdraw cash with their government\-issued money cards anymore, forcing them to shop in only two shops that accept these cards\. Not only will this increase crowding, it hurts independent shops organized in the camp that can only accept cash\.

The IOM did [announce](https://www.amna.gr/en/article/449515/IOM-Over-2-000-vulnerable-asylum-applicants-will-be-transferred-off-hotspots-preventatively) that over 2,000 vulnerable people, including everybody over the age of 65, will be transferred away from the hotspots and housed in hotel rooms\. However, much more needs to be done for people still stuck in these unsanitary camps before it is too late\.
### Violence Along the Balkan Route

A group of people on the move in Velika Kladuša , Una Sana canton of Bosnia and Herzegovina, were the victims of brutal treatment\. 
Pictures of their injuries can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/lorena.fornasir/posts/2832543133529432) \(warning: pictures are fairly graphic\) \.
#### SPAIN
### Union of Street Vendors Calls for Regularization of Undocumented People

The Barcelona\-based union [began](https://www.facebook.com/SindicatoPopulardeVendedoresAmbulantes/videos/vb.471268919742418/694108004689246/?type=2&theater) their campaign called “Regularizacion Ya,” calling for the status of undocumented people in Spain to be regulated immediately considering the extraordinary state caused by the epidemic\.

They also called on the government to immediately resolve asylum applications, release all people detained in the CIEs and CETIs in Ceuta and Melilla, and end racist policing\. The union has also been making masks to donate to medical personnel and organizing relief funds for the families of out\-of\-work street vendors\.
#### FRANCE
### Revolts Across French Detention Centers

Revolts were reported in several detention centers, including Vincennes and Mesnil\-Amelot against inhumane conditions during the epidemic\. Residents in Vincennes [reported](https://leparia.fr/sos-22h50-emeute-au-centre-de-retention-de-vincennes-quatrieme-cas-de-covid-19/?fbclid=IwAR1Mwfkl3YFTNoe0CUtc8NhvTSiDgyBSPx67xCPEDiuMKmqNcwO23_HL2ao) four probable cases of COVID\-19, but they have no access to doctors, isolated areas where sick people can quarantine safely, or protective equipment\. One man reportedly had difficulty breathing and the police refused to call an ambulance, saying he had to wait until Tuesday to get tested or receive medical care\. Residents are asking to be released or deported, not to be left to die\.

On Saturday night, 45 people, who were being detained in Mesnil\-Amelot, [occupied](https://www.humanite.fr/sans-papiers-une-revolte-violemment-reprimee-dans-un-centre-de-retention-687677?fbclid=IwAR2x9TP6HDaygW9vNVo32etmqv_U7VQzKG7B3wcsMk_4ItA_StzMk4oUtnk) the central courtyard of the complex and demanded to be released from the unsanitary conditions they are being held in\. The center is not being properly cleaned or disinfected\. There is no protective equipment for residents or police officers, and when residents complain they are beaten by the police\. The revolt was violently suppressed and many residents were beaten\. Their cellphones were taken and some were transferred to detention centers in other parts of France\.

For more information on the situation in France now and the context behind these incidents, stay tuned for our special on France, which is coming soon\.
