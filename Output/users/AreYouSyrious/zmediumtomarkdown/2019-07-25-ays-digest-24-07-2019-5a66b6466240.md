### AYS DIGEST 24/07/2019: 600 people are further endangered at the Tajoura Detention Facility, denied water\.

_All words and little will // More bold pushbacks across the region // Numbers increase in Balkan Route, but decrease on Western Mediterranean // New SAR missions\._

In spite of the statement published a few days ago by IOM and UNHCR, it appears that there remains little to no political will to actually do anything to prevent the abuse and terrorizing of people on the move\.

Turkey has officially suspended the EU\-Turkey deal\.

According to Keep Talking Greece,


> “The migrants readmission agreement with the European Union has been suspended,” Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu announced on Wednesday, following EU sanctions due to illegal drilling in the Exclusive Economic Zone of Cyprus\. 





> In an interview with Turkish private TGRT TV, Cavusoglu stated “we will not wait at the EU door\. The readmission agreement and the visa waiver will come into force simultaneously\. We have suspended the readmission agreement\.” 





This reflects a continuing escalation of the crisis of EU enlargement, with new rules and hoops being put into place for candidate countries\. This kind of never\-ending highway is gambling with people’s lives, and capitalizing on antagonizing locals against refugees\.

There remain ongoing reports of Syrians without registration being intimidated into signing voluntary return forms, and being returned to Syria\. Meanwhile Aegean Boat Reports published a detailed account of the pushback by the Greek coast guard to the Turkish coast guard\.


> In their report 
 

> “ A new video, that identifies the two boats involved, has appeared, showing clearly that the Greek Coast Guard, and Turkish Coast Guard boat Nr\. 21 were involved in this illegal pushback\. 





> In the new footage, we can see the Greek Coast Guard driving alongside the rubber dingy, and after a while leaving them, and then the Turkish Coast Guard arrived\. TCG use their normal method, dragging a long chain after the boat, rippling the engine of the rubber dingy, a very dangerous maneuver, that can put people in the water in seconds\.”

Specifically, the statement was about Libya, and search and rescue in the Mediterranean for that area… and what is the news there?


> In a word, a horror show\. 




600 people in Tajoura detention centre, the one that was hit by a missile, killing dozens, are being denied water since two days and have been “expelled” from the centre by the boss\. It is unclear if they can go anywhere or remain trapped there, vulnerable prey for traffickers\.

The useless statement again stating that “things need to change” is something we can all agree on, yet after so long, years of understanding that Libya is a war zone, there is effectively no pressure to change anything\. Functionally things remain the same\.


■■■■■■■■■■■■■■

> > Horrific news of another 38 people being taken to Tajoura after being intercepted by the Libyan Coast Guard.

No one should be returned to Libya, ESPECIALLY not to detention centres.

On 3 July, 50+ people in Tajoura died. How many more lives need to be lost before it is closed?

In fact, things remaining the same is the optimistic outlook as it seems that the powers\-that\-be seem intent on maintaining their malignant regret while slowly but steadily moving forward on border securitization projects\. It seems that politicians are aware of the impending climate apocalypse and how this will impact migration, they are just buying time to protect their palace\.

### **_EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN ROUTE_**

Snowmelt at the **_Turkish\-Iranian border_** has revealed the bodies of 25 men who perished trying to cross them\. It appears that they were not regular hikers, but rather people trying to find a better life\. Only four of the fifteen men originating from Africa could be identified and returned to their home countries for burial\.

The Turkish coast guard has rescued eight people off the coast of Bodrum and is still searching for one, [reportedly a child](https://twitter.com/IOMturkey/status/1153917360644022272) \.


> Additionally six boats arrived to Greece yesterday, carrying 235 people\. Again from Aegean Boat Report\. 




According to IOM, Greece is officially housing 68,700 people, and Italy has over around 112,000 people across the country\. The numbers in the **_Western Balkans \(specifically Bosnia, Montenegro, and Albania\)_** have been increasing, with a [minimum of 7,700 people in Bosnia, 1,000 in Albania, and 2,000 in Montenegro](https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Flows%20Compilation%20Report_final_0.pdf) \.

Furthermore, according to an ICRC report, there is a lack of access to the asylum request procedure, an acute problem in Bosnia, with less than 5% of those who have arrived being able to file a claim\. For a detailed look, go [here](https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/MDRBA011ou2.pdf) \.

**_Meanwhile, people in Tuzla_** , Bosnia continue to help those at their bus station\. The video, available in the group, is here\.

### CENTRAL MEDITERRANEAN

More boats are heading back into the Mediterranean, with the Alan Kurdi \(supported by Sea Eye\) heading out shortly with news that the Ocean Viking, which is standing in for the other SOS Mediterranee\-MSF partnered ship, the Aquarius, is setting out to sea\.

According to InfoMigrants,

“Louise Guillaumat, deputy director SOS Mediterranee operations, said at a press conference that the organization would not be forcing its way into Italian territorial waters; it refuses to take people back to Libya out of respect for international sea law\.”

Meanwhile, Sea\-Watch’s monitoring glider Moon Bird reports a dinghy in possible distress


■■■■■■■■■■■■■■

> > At 8.30z today #Moonbird spottet a rubber boat with ~75 persons on board, heading north, about 50nm off the Libyan Coast. Our crew informed the authorities and tried to contact nearby merchant vessel “ELBEIK” which was the only vessel within reach. The call was not answered. https://t.co/QkGx0MavIL

Meanwhile, UNHCR in Spain is reporting a decrease in arrivals to the **_WESTERN MEDITERRANEAN ROUTE_** , with arrivals having dropped compared to the same time period last year by 36%\. This is the cumulative arrivals between land and sea with sea arrivals having dropped by 40% and land arrivals, by 13%\. For more, go [here](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/documents/download/70464) \.
### FRANCE

In the context of the desperate situation, Legal volunteers are direly needed in France\. The group Legal Shelter is in need of volunteers to help those who are in Calais, facing dire circumstances and near daily harassment from authorities, access their rights\.
