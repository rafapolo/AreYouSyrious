#### FEATURED: Protests and injustice in Italian CPRs

We reported last week on the situation in the CPR at Gradisca D’Isonzo, in north\-eastern Italy\. On Friday, LasciateCIEentrare, an association supporting the rights of people on the move in detention, received a [video](https://fb.watch/1XjB8PS7Tb/) from inside the CPR, showing a detainee in respiratory crisis with no intervention from guards or doctors\. He had been asking for his inhaler, since the previous day, receiving no answer\.

On Thursday and Friday, protests and revolts took place in the CPR Corelli in Milan, [media](https://www.milanotoday.it/cronaca/rivolta-cpr-via-corelli-polizia-.html) and [Mai piu lager — No CPR](https://www.facebook.com/NoaiCPR/posts/838460420058799) report\. On Thursday one detainee was arrested after a protest\. The following day a further 40 detainees protested about the conditions and the lack of adequate anti\-COVID provisions\. 3 of them were arrested\. For many, the CPR is the last stop before deportation\. Even the police union admitted that the structure is inadequate and dangerous for both detainees and operators\. Only two of the five wings are currently open: the quarantine area had to be closed, and inmates who test positive sleep in one room in one of the open wings, without proper isolation\. No systematic testing has been done, despite authorities having promised periodic checks\.

Border Criminologies [released](https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/research-subject-groups/centre-criminology/centreborder-criminologies/blog/2020/11/no-one-looking-us?fbclid=IwAR3xD1h2GOSoULHsJzRnpUrfBZttmAz1YXiC90OSO5sPTGe9eDkVf5KMpD8) a report on Migrant detention and COVID\-19 in Italy\.

LIBYA
#### On evacuations to Rwanda

UNHCR reports that 79 people were evacuated on Thursday to Rwanda from Libya, within the framework of the Emergency Transit Mechanism \(ETM\) established between Government of Rwanda, UNHCR and the African Union \(AU\), which had been halted for nearly a year due to COVID\-19\. While evacuations from Libya are always positive news, many issues must be addressed regarding the future of the evacuees\. Despite having been selected by UNHCR on a vulnerability basis \(the modalities of the selection process are not entirely clear\), they will still have to ask for asylum in Rwanda, as Carola Gluck states\. One year ago, when the ETM was established, Jeff Crisps posed 25 questions on its working practices\. Most still await an answer\. Find them [HERE](https://twitter.com/JFCrisp/status/1172811710761189377) \.

SEA
#### Updates

Over the weekend, Open Arms’ ASTRAL sailboat has [left](https://twitter.com/openarms_found/status/1330189686816595968) the Med for a few days for necessary repairs\. Alarm Phone [reiterates](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1330083717017169926) the call for Search and Rescue operations for a boat with around 50 people who left Garabulli, Libya, on Thursday, which was reported by a fisherman\. Relatives are still looking for the missing\. “We fear another shipwreck\.” On Sunday, the Red Crescent [reportedly](https://twitter.com/JavierMartinr1/status/1330516882298966017) found five more bodies washed up on the beach in Misrata, Libya\. It is unclear for how long they had been in the water\.

GREECE
#### **Calls to stop the building of the new “super camp” on Lesvos**

[Local media report](https://www.stonisi.gr/post/13116/katastrofikh-h-politikh-toy-egklwvismoy-sta-nhsia?fbclid=IwAR27KrsVqQZD6bkUrDdbt4wSukXsFLmKxbTHjQLsBsEbze9K1cmdPZlsWH8#.X7jdJ-F3hm4.facebook) that the Initiative for a Sustainable Solution of refugees in Lesvos has met with the Deputy Director\-General of the EU Directorate\-General for Migration and Head of the EU Task Force on Migration Management, Mrs Beate Gminder, and the General Secretary of the Ministry of Migration and Asylum, Mr Logothetis to call for alternative solutions for Lesvos\.

The Initiative calls for a decongestion of the island and an end to geographical restrictions, believing that 1000 places, already adequately provided by the original Kara Tepe camp, should be enough if people only have to stay long enough to register their claim for asylum before moving to the mainland\. They decry the conditions of Moria 2\.0 and asked that it is closed immediately, a sentiment shared by many\.

■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 


They believe a new camp would increase problems on the island for both people on the move and local residents\. We agree\.
#### **Moria 2\.0, the home of modern conveniences…**

#### **Volunteers asked not to travel to Lesvos until COVID\-19 is under control**

[Stand by me Lesvos](https://www.facebook.com/standbymelesvosNGO/posts/768165187109839) is asking that short\-term volunteers from abroad do not travel to the island at the present time as cases of COVID\-19 are still rising and hospital places are limited\. They thank everyone who wants to come, but suggest that this is not the right time\.
#### **Updates on Fady’s case**

[The Global Legal Action Network](https://www.glanlaw.org/enforced-disappearance-greece) are continuing to work on Fady’s case, [as we reported last week](ays-daily-digest-17-11-2020-violent-dismantling-of-camp-saint-denis-cb73df0e4c37) , while looking at the wider context which this case represents, that of pushbacks and enforced disappearances being normalised within border security policy\.


> According to Itamar Mann, Legal Advisor with GLAN: “Historically, the prohibition of enforced disappearances emerged from contexts of authoritarian rule\. Today, border violence at the Southeastern border of the EU has acquired a fundamentally authoritarian aspect\. These enforced disappearances do not replicate previous historical precedents\. But when expulsions are no longer directed only at the undocumentd but also towards the legally present, there are striking similarities\. Enforced disappearances provide the closest concept within our legal vocabulary,”

BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
#### First snow in Bihac

IOM\-BiH representative Van de Auweraert warns the international community that the first snow has arrived for the 1,500 people living in Lipa camp in Bihac\. A camp that Bosnian authorities put up in the spring to move people on the move away from major inhabited areas in the canton\. A camp that is not equipped for winter\.


■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 
> **[Peter Van der Auweraert](https://twitter.com/PeterAuweraert) @ Twitter Says:** 

> > First snow tonight falling over #migrant accommodation centre “Lipa” #Bihac #BiH. Reminder: tent camp was established as #COVID19 response for spring/summer &amp; no winterization action was ever taken - an alternative solution for 1500 residents is needed, fast. @[UNmigration](https://twitter.com/UNmigration) @[UN_BiH](https://twitter.com/UN_BiH) https://t.co/42BiBGt046 

> **Tweeted at [2020-11-20 23:20:11](https://twitter.com/peterauweraert/status/1329927548264964097).** 

■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 


While we appreciate that he is raising awareness regarding much needed winterization, there is a problem: IOM has been involved in the management of the camp since its inception; it was clear from the beginning that Lipa camp was everything but a temporary response, that it was the unsafe, out of the way, and repressive response of a government which considers people on the move as a public order problem only\. AYS has been warning people about the situation there for months\. Did IOM really not notice that winter was coming? Is it incompetence or is it complicity?

FRANCE
#### More reports on Tuesday’s eviction

This was the first eviction ‘organised’ autonomously by the national police and gendarmerie\. As the group [report](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1595662970634469&id=598228360377940) , it was a surreal and brutal experience:


> Where police officers gas people waiting to get in the buses\. 





> Where women and children stay parked for hours before they can board the buses\. 





> Where in the middle of a pandemic thousands of people are forced to spend hours next to each other, without the possibility of distancing\. 





> Where journalists are kept away, prohibited from entering the perimeter set for the eviction\. 





> Where people are left for hours without access to water and toilets\. 





> Where volunteer citizens who wanted to leave the perimeter are prevented by law enforcement, and to say things clearly, held prisoners against their will\. 





> Where 1000 people are hunted like cattle by police after 12 hours of waiting, from Saint\-Denis to Paris\. 






> With the new security law being discussed in the country at the moment, a video like the one above would be illegal\. Thousands took the street to protest on Saturday\. Read more [HERE](https://www.dw.com/en/france-thousands-protest-against-bill-to-curb-filming-of-police/a-55688011) \. 




A testimony was [collected](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1594664324067667&id=598228360377940) on Thursday, two days after the eviction:


> … Nearly 1000 people are scattered in Paris, we do not know where they are\. We can’t do any more fixed distribution like we used to do when there was the camp at Porte de Paris, however we still try to do it at Rosa Parks, a place known for food distributions … So we meet those people who shelter from rain and cold as they can … it’s a primary, basic need simply being able to sit down, lay down one night in a place safe from wind and rain\. I had no questions about the asylum procedure that night but only questions we couldn’t answer: “Where can we go”\. They know it’s hard to get tents so they ask the minimum “Do you just have a blanket or a sleeping bag? Clothes for the rain?”\. Walking through the neighborhood, we meet small groups, 2,3 people walking fast, looking behind them\. They know they are hunted down by those who follow ‘orders’\. Fear and tired sweat in their speeches, they expect response from us … They all ask us ′“Why do they do that?”

#### Woman in detention separated from her 20 day old baby in Toulouse

La Cimade [reports](https://www.20minutes.fr/toulouse/2912847-20201120-haute-garonne-jeune-mere-privee-enfant-femme-enceinte-retention-coup-gueule-cimade?fbclid=IwAR3i5fUTJVdsiNy1oqJr9kt8mboKuIByCw1WXv0_OKtaCqLaR-BY7WWIxsI) on the detention of a woman in the CRA \(administrative detention\) in Toulouse for 4 days, after being separated from her 20 day old baby, in total violation of the European Convention on Human Rights\.

On Sunday, groups of activists took to the street of Marseilles to [stand in solidarity](https://mars-infos.org/tous-tes-devant-le-cra-pour-exiger-5440?fbclid=IwAR1vjKGTCrJm_gMe2pEBdi64sKLitq9DRNF8UB5No768GhAWlaAjOxwq0aM) with those detained in the CRAs:


> According to the State, _“the administrative detention center is not a prison because the deprivation of liberty is not a judicial decision but an administrative decision\. Deprivation of liberty is not coercive in nature\. We must therefore speak of detention and not of detention or imprisonment\. “_ 
 

> According to hundreds of testimonies from within, press releases, association reports and media inquiries: these are prisons for undocumented migrants\. We know it\. These are places of deprivation of liberty, police violence, places where threats and humiliation are daily, execrable food, poor hygiene, places where anti\-covid\-19 health measures are not applied, care refused, places that are poorly or not heated in winter, places of isolation\.
 

> This hypocrisy is unbearable\. These confinements are unbearable\.

A young Sudani died on the motorway on Thursday the 19th. We don't know his name or age. This merits a two paragraph article in the local paper and nothing in ENG/FR national media. These senseless deaths are now routine #noborder #thisborderkills #calais

#### **Home Office plan pre Christmas mass deportation to Jamaica during lockdown**

A [mass deportation flight to Jamaica](https://www.change.org/p/stop-all-charter-flight-mass-deportations-to-jamaica-other-commonwealth-countries-jamaica50/u/28086646?fbclid=IwAR3f5P2QDnfaK2BGqisxki2fJnAXkEbKOlLs1KaZ1AtxfbTPM6J363nkgHk) is planned, most likely on the 2nd of December\. People have been given no chance to even say goodbye to their families and are in an at risk group for COVID\-19\. You can support them in the following ways:


> If you are on twitter, tweet @ukhomeoffice and call on them to stop the flight\. Please use the hashtags \#Jamaica50 and \#enddeportations 





> Write to your MP and ask them to raise concerns urgently with the Home Secretary
