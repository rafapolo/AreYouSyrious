### Sea

With its sailing boat Astral, Proactiva is back in the central Mediterranean\. In coordination with SOS Mediterranee and Sea\-Watch, they rescued more than 500 people today\. Sea\-Watch’s airplane, the Moonbird, found two boats, including one wooden boat carrying 294 people\.

In another case that Sea\-Watch documented today, the MRCC reported another boat in distress 60 miles off the shore of Libya\. Even though Sea\-Watch reached the spot, the coordination was assigned to the Libyan forces — who were not even on\-site\. When they arrived, some people jumped into the water, screaming “no Libya”\. At this point, Sea\-Watch intervened and rescued the people\. The NGO states, the LCG consented the transhipment\.

With more than 530 survivors, the Aquarius is now on its way to Italy to disembark the people\.

### Greece

Will newly arrived people on the Greek islands finally have the right to move to the mainland? A court recently overturned the restrictions last week, as AYS previously [reported](ays-daily-digest-17-4-18-going-public-about-the-croatian-police-pressure-and-false-charges-against-b4ac9af94009) \. However, this does not necessarily mean that people will have the possibility to do so\. As RefuComm informs: “A new bill was brought to the Greek Parliament on Thursday 19th April with a view to making it legal for the Greek Asylum Service to restrict movement\.” Also Greek authorities stated, they will not allow the people to move to the mainland\. “ Therefore, the restriction of movement will unfortunately remain,” RefuComm says\. Their [post](https://www.facebook.com/notes/refucomm/rumours/597548727263600/) is also available in Arabic and Farsi\. Additionally, they posted a film, which explains the situation on the Greek islands\.

On Lesvos, Moria residents continued to protest at the Sappho Squre in Mytilini\. They demand better treatment, as a man died due to the lack of medical support this week \( [read the AYS report about it](ays-daily-digest-19-04-18-how-many-more-people-will-die-on-the-aegean-islands-3ec1132f00aa) \) \.

### Bosnia

Volunteers are needed, especially in Velika Kladusa\. At the moment, there are only two international volunteers working with six locals\. As there are sometimes hundres of people, more international support is more than welcome\.

Especially experienced volunteers are requested\. In Bosnia, it is required to be registered at some adress\. Usually, the house or hotel owners do it\. But it is important, because the police is increasingly putting pressure on international volunteers\. It would be best to come with your own car and commit for at least one month\.

Right\-wing extremists, reportedly from the Generation Identity, met at the Col de l’Echelle today, which is a crossing point of the French\-Italian border\. They presented a banner saying “Closed Border\. You will not make Europe home\! No way\. Back to your homeland\!”\. They also raised a symbolic frontier using plastic wire mesh, Le Monde [reports](http://www.lemonde.fr/europe/article/2018/04/21/alpes-des-militants-d-extreme-droite-vont-bloquer-le-col-de-l-echelle-lieu-de-passage-de-migrants_5288720_3214.html?utm_term=Autofeed&utm_campaign=Echobox&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Facebook) \.

### Netherlands

Today, was a troubleful day in the Rudolf Dieselstraat in Amsterdam, where rejected asylum seekers, who are in a legal gap — and some cannot be deported — occupy some buildings\. First it was reported, that members of the far\-right Generation Identity went into a building in the neighborhood of the “We are here” group and waived a banner “illegal is criminal”\. Enough is enough [reports](https://enoughisenough14.org/2018/04/21/amsterdam-antifa-activists-forced-generation-identity-fascists-to-leave-squat/) : “The fascists were invited by somebody who has a temporary rent contract to avoid a squatting action\.”

Provoked by this action, members of the left\-wing movement Antifa reacted and attacked the house as well as the facist group memebrs with stones and fire crackers, so they had to leave the building for medical care\.

In a statement, “We are here” [said](https://www.facebook.com/WijZijnHier/posts/1861664227200465) :


> “We want to emphasize that this neighborhood should not be a political war\-arena and that it has become so because of the media and politics\. We find the lack of decisiveness of the police and municipality to be shocking\. We hereby repeat that we did not come to the Netherlands, to Amsterdam, or to the Rudolf Dieselstraat to cause problems\. It may be clear by now why we are here\. But these extreme \( \-ly dangerous\) rightwing groups are indeed out to cause problems\. Against us and against the local residents who are absolutely not waiting for the arrival of these new Nazis\.” 




Khalid Jone, a spokesperson of the group, [added](https://www.facebook.com/khalid.jone.7/posts/2002048750060103) :


> “We emphasize that we were not involved in this case, nor did we know that this was going to happen\. We do not want to interfere in the battle between these two groups, although we are now in the middle of it\. We have done our best to prevent this situation by constantly being in contact with the police about the state of affairs concerning these right\-wing groups that are threatening us\. It is disappointing that Ymere and Camelot let themselves be used in this way\. We are also disappointed that right\-wing extremist groups are constantly trying to disrupt public order in the neighborhood\.”
