#### All Military Assistance With Evacuation Must Leave by the End of August as EU Shuts Its Doors

It’s been confirmed that military personnel assisting with evacuation from Afghanistan must leave by the end of August, making the situation that much more urgent for people desperately trying to flee\.

If you are in Afghanistan or know somebody who is, [this website](http://www.exitsos.com/?fbclid=IwAR3IJjSzjC92ij_zz_PNXskVq3Ovqtci6NgmGUrKMD1Q64SlLgD3C6tzdaA) provides a list of helpful links and contacts to help people get out of the country\. Please share widely\.

As the deadline looms, the hope for a humanitarian solution is tightening as governments are turning to xenophobia and militarized borders instead of helping people in need\. While the situation at the EU’s borders has been dire for some time, recent rhetoric and actions has shown that it is possible for it to get worse\.

Whatever lukewarm action the EU might have taken is undermined by its internal divisions\. While EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen [called for a humanitarian corridor](https://twitter.com/CamilleLeCoz/status/1429832172253454343?fbclid=IwAR2IBXN4nVvKkF7FghHI7_6YBSb82_FDKktY_DrlXeI8BWFoB_iDXNSvWb8) , Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Janša, whose country now holds the Council Presidency, said that there would be no corridors for people leaving Afghanistan and that there was not even a simple [majority in the Council](https://www.novinite.com/articles/210880/No+consensus+on+Afghan+Refugees+in+EU?fbclid=IwAR3uKiAy0hIs2SLWikGZ03YcVRTvpIS8ooXI3wPQ9lsuB3leB42T71GqbwA) for accepting more people\. He was in turn countered by the President of the European Parliament, [David Sassoli](https://the-president.europarl.europa.eu/en/newsroom/sassoli-to-jana-work-with-us-to-show-solidarity?fbclid=IwAR38wmq8WjMN7z88MeGAavfNHu-cY6A3Ehx4IFeCi6gHxKHoO5Kauw2uTe8) , who said that the Slovenians cannot dictate EU policy and should work with the bloc instead\. As European countries are treating Afghan people already in their country poorly, [for example Greece](https://rsaegean.org/en/practical-and-immediate-solidarity-with-the-afghan-refugees/?fbclid=IwAR1FQxjhMg3OELmZEkS2MWqkQZVBWKUSyeZEPJtktsep4Dm2-4OnHmluQxA) which still has not suspended the returns to Turkey, waiting on them to take humanitarian action might be futile\.

MEP Erik Marquardt helped organize a charter flight to evacuate people from Kabul \(although the flight still needs donations, you can support it [here](https://twitter.com/ErikMarquardt/status/1429894600471289861?s=19&fbclid=IwAR3IJjSzjC92ij_zz_PNXskVq3Ovqtci6NgmGUrKMD1Q64SlLgD3C6tzdaA) \) \. However, it should not be up to individual MEPs to conduct action when the EU represents some of the wealthiest nations in the world\.

While the EU sits on its hands, Afghan people are finding even more doors to safety slammed in their face\. Turkey is [militarizing its eastern border](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/23/world/europe/afghanistan-refugees-turkey-iran-taliban-airport.html?fbclid=IwAR0JrWQmRePTymolCrOAwqfW4AN8kZa832iPW2qw27ClvqsA6NH262sYU08) with Iran, and many Afghan people are stopped by the border wall or pushed back by the police\.

Even people that make it out of Afghanistan must pass through legal purgatory before getting a chance to start their new lives\. The U\.S\. is asking other countries to “temporarily” host evacuees, [including Rwanda](https://twitter.com/taarifarwanda/status/1429791385717256194?fbclid=IwAR0U2kfCPRk3XERJ3ADyNqP7THIMaTK4nuvo2M78Z26x3XkvN5ChQPby5Uk) \. While this is not the same as the [offshore asylum processing center](https://twitter.com/JFCrisp/status/1429822353136050179?fbclid=IwAR2L50BSt0mDZH2UHJ28lsEIP_Po5X0IjctS4qRgnfY7vIBYUBZMmZ8htnM) Denmark wants to build, the question remains as to how long people will be forced to remain there in limbo before they are allowed to start their new life in the United States\.

Many Western nations are clamoring about how they cannot “cope” with more people on the move arriving from Afghanistan\. However, people have been displaced from Afghanistan for decades and most of them end up staying in neighboring countries\. While Europe clamors about sharing the “burden” \(as if people are burdens\), the reality is that it is the continent that has not been providing its fair share of help\. [This article](https://theconversation.com/where-do-afghanistans-refugees-go-166316?fbclid=IwAR0aBY2T8X8urmnXgd7w2jBoIbiSVWl3Y8XwEy4tDda1f6nM4b9zlW-Z9iI) outlines the disparity between where many Afghans are relocated and the media narrative\.

#### SEA
#### Arrivals, Rescues, and Shipwrecks

_Arrivals:_ [322 rescued people](https://twitter.com/MSF_Sea/status/1429872879349510151?fbclid=IwAR1ah-3pMoOrmnPL6B4UlKysECNhArjDVyeZZPrcOZATFwtRT6N5xm6s5uI) from the Geo Barents were finally able to disembark in Augusta, Sicily after COVID\-19 testing\.

Also in Sicily, patrol boats [intercepted three boats](https://www.ilsicilia.it/migranti-soccorsi-tre-barconi-con-113-tunisini-a-poche-miglia-da-lampedusa/?fbclid=IwAR0LxH4-UANDeSFaVvo-YD4FfSsBGshKPn9dLJ2RQIDzy2etPXNQ8P9KMKk) carrying 113 people near Lampedusa\.

_Rescues:_ Salvamento Maritimo [rescued a patera](https://ondafuerteventura.es/rescatada-otra-patera-en-fuerteventura-con-55-personas-a-bordo/?fbclid=IwAR3VimFul34ZuVK21qHrAypbGiH0gwHnUUA0jPt2Pxfsl08qN7nN1ZRwwWo) with 55 people on board near Fuerteventura\.

The rescue capacity in the Mediterranean just got new reinforcements as Proactiva Open Arms’ ship the _Astral_ returns to the [central Mediterranean](https://www.facebook.com/proactivaservice/posts/4500045416692941) \.

_Distress Cases:_ AlarmPhone were contacted by a [group of 25 people](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1429857719490650113?fbclid=IwAR0LIXzXZMG_kcOKMWYzRURvRv4_OmSwj7Q_CHTEnIjUYnh8qU-knCbze2Y) in distress in the Maltese SAR zone on Monday afternoon\. The group includes many children and several people in need of immediate medical attention\. As of Tuesday morning, there has been no update in their situation\.

Meanwhile, a shipwreck off the coast of Zuwara in Libya [caused 16 people](https://twitter.com/MissingMigrants/status/1429790077740363780?fbclid=IwAR3XPGOThyg9n7fQusj5U8TBp_AqmxMwIUJSYmlcfz8KFSAYXSxdpjar3do) to go missing\. 48 people were rescued\.
#### CYPRUS
#### 88 Syrians Deported to Lebanon

The Cypriot government [deported 88 Syrian people](https://apnews.com/article/europe-middle-east-syria-lebanon-migration-214ef51c716dfa2d3692d36d9b6feb48?fbclid=IwAR3Rt8P9PrbAWwyAzZsmdFuOEfGjJPEOj0Pucok13FpJu2d0fXH1zfnar4M) who tried to reach the island nation from Lebanon after police boats intercepted their vessels off of the island’s coast\. Cyprus has a deal with Lebanon that it can return anyone who tries to reach the country by sea, even though human rights advocates point out that this violates people’s right to asylum\.

Lebanon is currently going through a severe economic crisis and shortages of several vital goods, including fuel, that affect people marginalized by the economy, which includes most Syrians, the hardest\.
#### GREECE
#### Is The Commission Still Financing Frontex in the Aegean?

After months of advocacy by people on the move and allies on the ground about rampant pushbacks in the Aegean by Greek forces and Frontex, the situation even started to get noticed by official sources\. Now, it looks as if the Commission may even have taken action\.

According to Kathimerini in an article about Greece’s “preparations” for arrivals from Afghanistan, the relationship between Frontex, Greek authorities, and the Commission is in “ [deep crisis](https://www.kathimerini.gr/politics/561472225/evros-anatoliko-aigaio-schedia-ektaktis-anagkis-apo-el-as-kai-limeniko/?fbclid=IwAR08juqNT5ve-q_V1B8KILcYRZw7_XJrojxkZsahZjnJXWIsoDl92JOwWVI) ,” so much so that the Greek authorities are unsure how much they can count on Frontex assistance\. Allegedly, Frontex has not been co\-financing operations in the eastern Aegean for months after a wave of pushback allegations, and the co\-financing fund is nearly empty\.

So far, there is very little information about this, only from an anonymous source in the above\-mentioned newspaper\. Frontex assets have still been seen in the Aegean\. If true, this would be an explosive development that also raises more questions than answers\. It is still unclear about how the Commission stopped financing the mission, although the most viable theory is that they [activated article 46](https://twitter.com/lk2015r/status/1429718708142985220?fbclid=IwAR057rLiU2ybzSMDr8Aw7sikqBIeor07yeIbf3z81Abk5ZYGO5pM2vRPDcg) without telling anyone\. It also raises the question of why they kept the change in financing a secret\.

While the secrecy continues, people are [already blaming NGOs](https://twitter.com/lk2015r/status/1429779917110185984?fbclid=IwAR1h8wI-jNZhE2dN-CVs3ZMwGQivbBFukyoEINC-qx9pa8JOamJ4d-_aN1U) for this decision\. If Frontex did stop funding missions in the eastern Aegean because of excessive violence and pushbacks \(a stoppage that would be motivated by PR more than genuine humanitarian concern\), then that is solely the fault of Greek authorities that acted with impunity, not with NGOs that merely told the world the truth\.
#### SLOVENIA
#### Slovenian Police Conduct Violent Pushback

A young man from Morocco was brutalized by Slovenian police near Novi Mesto\. He tried asking for asylum, but they beat him and kicked him, leaving him with lasting bruises\. When he tried asking for asylum again in the police station, they signed documents in his name, denied him a lawyer, and wouldn’t even let him call his Slovenian girlfriend\. The man is now in Bosnia & Herzegovina, where he was pushed back by Croatian police\. Read the full story [here](https://www.facebook.com/Tukajsmo/posts/502983737473232) \.
#### AUSTRIA
#### Outrage Stops Planned Deportation of Single Mother With Disabled Son

Tuesday morning, Austria had scheduled the deportation of Mrs\. I \(name changed to protect her anonymity\) \. Mrs\. I had arrived from Nigeria in 2013 and applied for asylum multiple times\. She is the mother of four children, two of which are born in Austria\. The government planned to deport them anyway\.

At the last minute, the family [did not board the plane](https://www.derstandard.at/story/2000129115204/kritik-an-abschiebung-von-alleinerziehender-mutter-und-autistischem-sohn-nach?fbclid=IwAR3IJjSzjC92ij_zz_PNXskVq3Ovqtci6NgmGUrKMD1Q64SlLgD3C6tzdaA) \. The family’s lawyers issued a new asylum application on Monday morning, focusing on the dangers that one of the children, who is autistic, would face in Nigeria\. Nigeria does not have adequate support systems for children with disabilities, and the boy needs one\-on\-one support and special schooling\. There is also danger from the mother’s family, who might consider the boy “possessed\.”

The pause came after days of public and legal outcry at the treatment of this young family\. Even the director of the oldest son’s school and the new asylum spokeswoman got involved\. We hope that the family will be able to stay in Austria, which is the only country that two of the children have ever known, but the traumas of this attempted deportation will probably stay with them forever\. A state that is quick to deport children cannot pay lip service to human rights and child protection\.
#### FRANCE
#### Dispatches from the Bridges of Paris

Due to the French government’s inability \(and refusal\) to provide asylum seekers with housing, many are sleeping rough on the streets and outskirts in Paris, although they can’t get a solid night’s sleep in fear of expulsions by police which happen often\. Volunteers from Solidarite migrants Wilson shared their visit to one such place:

“Another man told us that he prefers to sleep under the bridge while he is waiting for housing because it protects them from the rain, then he told us what happened the night before \(August 17th\) \. He couldn’t believe the attitude of the police at all, asking us, ‘how does sleeping under the bridge hurt the police\.’\[…\]The young man who told us that said that the police wanted to gas him with tear gas because he was filming the eviction\.”

#### SPAIN
#### Collective Expulsions Earlier This Month

People in Ceuta are still [processing the collective expulsions](https://www.facebook.com/NoNameKitchenBelgrade/posts/1302922296772718) of minors that happened on August 13th\. The authorities put the children on a school bus without telling them where they were going\. Volunteers were blocked from helping them and about 15 minors were returned that day\. The collective deportations continued until August 16th, when a court finally paused them\. However, they are only paused not banned\. Solidarity with the minors and the people on the ground working to protect their rights\.
#### NETHERLANDS
#### Government Separating Children From Their Parents With New Asylum Policy

The Dutch government changed its asylum procedures to state that children who arrive in the Netherlands as unaccompanied minors and stay with members of their extended family can no longer [apply for family reunification](https://nltimes.nl/2021/08/23/hundreds-kids-growing-without-parents-due-new-asylum-policy?fbclid=IwAR3OrCgTXRpyrMWRZz6ZQPcwKw-Mrwr8ExYf-Vg3iNj2hXke1xYyVzwQcnY) with their parents and siblings\. This internal policy has been in place since November of last year, despite the objections of IND staff\. About 200 children have been affected so far\.

#### EU/FRONTEX
#### Frontex Splashes Out More Money on Surveillance

The EU border agency [awarded 84\.5 million euro](https://abolishfrontex.org/blog/2021/08/23/frontex-awards-e84-5-million-in-aerial-surveillance-contracts/?fbclid=IwAR1FQxjhMg3OELmZEkS2MWqkQZVBWKUSyeZEPJtktsep4Dm2-4OnHmluQxA) s in contracts for more aerial surveillance in the Mediterranean\. Of course, none of this surveillance will be used to spot boats in distress and coordinate rescue, judging by Frontex’s past indifference to shipwrecks\.

Frontex has been using aerial surveillance for several years, often with the same companies, but there is a troubling lack of transparency around it\. The Commission does not specify which aircraft the agency uses and the companies often switch off transponders transmitting real\-time location data\. The agency had also [advertised helicopter missions](https://twitter.com/matthimon/status/1429815520233201668?fbclid=IwAR0Q5bQeAJ6H7eDG2w1BRhLIgqNUeF1pApaoC62ztsmDOD78DinmYY7rT1k) which never wound up taking place, although nobody knows why\.
