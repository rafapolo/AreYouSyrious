### Violence towards asylum seekers in Lesbos, MSF denounced

A game of mutual accusations that never seems to stop\. The Greek government accuses Turkey of instrumentalising migrants and stresses that action must be taken as soon as possible\. This is what emerged from [the meeting](https://greekcitytimes.com/2022/10/29/migration-minister-united-nations/) between Greek Migration & Asylum Minister Notis Mitarakis and the President of the UN General Assembly, Csaba Kőrösi on Thursday\. The greek minister stated:


> “It must avoid incidents such as the recent one with the 92 migrants, who were found naked by [Frontex](https://greekcitytimes.com/2022/02/17/frontex-reports-spike-in-irregular-attempts-to-enter-eu/) and Greek authorities, expelled by the neighboring authorities” 





\(Here [our digest](ays-news-digest-18-10-22-ninety-two-men-found-stripped-naked-on-the-evros-border-68537dea2b69) on the episode of the 92 people forced to strip\)

However, the involvement of the Greek authorities in pushbacka has been demonstrated several times, putting the lives of people seeking refuge at risk\. 
The people on the move face numerous situations of extreme violence, both physical and psychological\. Not only is the journey itself dangerous, but the risk of being taken back by the Greek or Turkish authorities prevents these people from seeking asylum, as is their right\.

Added to this is the hostility of some local groups against migrants\. A few days ago some people, whose identity is not known, stopped and attacked a group of people who had arrived on the island of Lesvos\.


> “Everybody was crying; women, children and men\. Three people were handcuffed very tightly with plastic bundles\. Four others were injured\. Based on their reports, the injuries were due to violence from a group of people who had left when we approached” 





Told Teo Di Piazza, MSF project coordinator in Lesbo\. The people were in critical condition and 4 of them were taken immediately to hospital

The group, which already needed medical health care, had to suffer further humiliation, which impacted on their psychological health\. Three of them had in fact been handcuffed, presumably by the people who had attacked them before they were found by the msf team

#### LEBANON
### Lebanon starts a ‘voluntary return’ programme for refugees in Syria, with NGOs concerned about human rights

According to the Lebanese authorities, 751 Syrian refugees ‘voluntarily’ returned to Syria on Wednesday thanks to a [programme](http://famagusta-gazette.com/2022/10/27/500000-syrian-refugees-register-for-their-voluntary-return-home-from-lebanon/?fbclid=IwAR1GlqAKX9ZCcj9UwRO2BwUplEbcx_HE86KjKOaYHXahOQhzm4kqk2fVCvU) coordinated by the Lebanese General Security \(responsible for border security\) \. Many human rights associations and ngo’s seem concerned about the coercive aspect of this voluntary return programme\. In recent years, Lebanon has been facing numerous difficulties that have led to economic collapse and this has certainly affected the living conditions of refugees seeking shelter\. Syria is a country that has been experiencing war and conflict since 2011 and for many people returning means risking their lives, both because of the danger of torture and retaliation, and because of the overall situation in the country

People on the move attempting the sea crossing from Turkey are on the rise, as are those trying to reach the EU from the Balkan route\. It should be remembered that Turkey deports to Syria and Afghanistan despite the danger to those being returned \( [read more here](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/44223/turkey-accused-of-deporting-hundreds-of-refugees-to-syria) \)

### Clashes at overcrowded migrant center in Cyprus

Clashes broke out at the Pournaras reception facility, a migrant center about 22 km from Nicosia\. Because the facility is overcrowded, tensions between groups easily reach their limits\. In fact, tensions between the groups were the explosive spark\. Police responded with tear gas and three people were taken to the hospital once the situation calmed down\.

The migration issue is bursting into the political debate in Slovakia ahead of the [upcoming elections](https://www.foreignbrief.com/daily-news/slovakia-to-hold-regional-elections/?fbclid=IwAR1rDPOYK3Q5npG_dlh5MKv_PPWDvyLmxJXw2lSfgubh_OECqYbydfxjfTE) \.

#### CZECH REPUBLIC
### The Czech Republic extends border controls with Slovakia until 12nd December

While until 1993 the Czech Republic and Slovakia were a unitary country, today they are not only two different states, but are also separated by border controls, despite both being part of the Shengen area\. In fact, Prime Minister Petr Fiala has decided to extend temporary controls along the border with Slovakia\.

Slovak authorities have criticized this measure accusing that border checks within EU are against the principles of the EU’s open\-border Schengen area\.

The controls were initially reintroduced on September 28th\. This restriction to free movement was then extended for an additional month and now it has been announced that this measure will be valid until December 12nd to prevent migrants from using Czech territory as a transit zone to reach Germany\. Indeed many people on the move are going through the Balkan Route \(since they have no access to regular ways\) and are afterwards passing by Czech in order to reach other EU countries\.

#### ITALY
### People in distress at sea wait to disembark while the new Italian government immediately shows its securitarian face

Giorgia Meloni’s new far\-right government immediately demonstrates its securitarian and criminalising approach to people crossing the Mediterranean and the NGOs that rescue them\. Already during the political propaganda period, Meloni had declared that she wanted to implement a ‘naval blockade’ and curb any new arrivals of boats from North Africa\. These days more than 400 people rescued by Ocean Viking and other NGOs are waiting to be disembarked\. Read more here:
