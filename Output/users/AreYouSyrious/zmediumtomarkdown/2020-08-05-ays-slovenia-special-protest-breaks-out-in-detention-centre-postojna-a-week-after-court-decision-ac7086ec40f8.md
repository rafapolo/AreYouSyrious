The detention centre in Postojna \(Centre za tujce\), Slovenia, is a prison\-like institution used for detaining foreigners who are, for various reasons, deemed not welcome in the country\. People can be detained in Postojna for months, let go and detained again and again\. Slovenia does not extradite to a number of countries, so the underlying assumption of this institution is that “unwelcome” people would give in under such prison\-like conditions and leave the country voluntarily\. The detention centre had already been used in the past when the number of asylum seekers who arrived via the Balkan route grew beyond the official capacity, as well as a place for temporary detention of people predestined to be returned to Croatia and then further to Bosnia\. In late spring 2020 an _ad hoc_ infrastructure was constructed on the premises of the detention centre in order to facilitate detainment of an increased number of asylum seekers in a manner similar to, if not worse than, IOM\-run centres in Bosnia\. Last Tuesday’s protest in the detention centre highlights the plight that these people have faced\. They risked everything to come to Europe, they searched for safety and security\. What they found was a detention centre where they are being held, and in many cases the fundamental right to apply for asylum has been ignored by the authorities\.

The protest was held only one week after the Slovenian Administrative court ruled in favour of a person from Cameroon who was denied the right to apply for asylum\. The court decided that “ [The Republic of Slovenia has violated the Applicant’s right to asylum](https://www.borderviolence.eu/wp-content/uploads/PRESS-KIT-FOR-INTERNATIONAL-MEDIA.pdf) \(Article 18 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights\), t [he prohibition of collective expulsions](https://www.borderviolence.eu/wp-content/uploads/PRESS-KIT-FOR-INTERNATIONAL-MEDIA.pdf) \(Article 19 § 1\), [and the prohibition of torture](https://www.borderviolence.eu/wp-content/uploads/PRESS-KIT-FOR-INTERNATIONAL-MEDIA.pdf) \(Article 19 § 2\)”\. His case is identical to that of the approximately 20000 people who have been “informally returned” to Bosnia in the last two years and of those seen protesting in the photos\. This demonstration in the detention centre was a desperate act and a struggle for the right to apply for international protection, as in the absence of information, communication and legal assistance they have been given no way to apply for asylum in Slovenia\.
