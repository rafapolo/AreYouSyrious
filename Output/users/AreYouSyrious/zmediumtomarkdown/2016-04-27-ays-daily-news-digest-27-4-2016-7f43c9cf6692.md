### **AYS DAILY NEWS DIGEST 27\.4\.2016\.**
#### _People are still moving through the Balkan route and towards Europe, often with smugglers\. Meanwhile, Turkey and the EU have reached an agreement which promises to allow non\-Syrians to register and apply for asylum as well\. The Greek government promised that it will soon speed up rulings on asylum applications\. Austrian parliament passed legislation that makes it significantly harder for refugees to seek asylum in Austria, and would allow for the government to declare a state of emergency if the influx of refugees into the country threatens “national security,” and allows asylum seekers to be rejected directly at the border\. Amnesty International harshly criticized this decision\._

> _Refugees are continuing to arrive to Greece, and more are making their way into other countries on the Balkan route, as well as some EU countries\. According to the [UNHCR data](http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/country.php?id=83) , yesterday 62 people were registered on the Greek islands, 17 on mainland Greece\.

This is critical to the EU, as it allows it to accelerate deportations — Greek judges only agreed to dismiss refugees’ appeals if Turkey extended legal guarantees to migrants\. Out of 6,500 refugees stranded on the Greek islands, 2,500 come from Syria, while the rest comes from Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Bangladesh and other countries\._

> _The Greek government has said that authorities will soon speed up rulings on asylum applications, as the requests have been piling up\. Many criticisms have been made of the process for being far too slow\. The government’s spokesman for the migration crisis, Giorgos Kyritsis, said that Athens was “not cutting corners and not delaying\.” About 8,000 refugees and migrants are currently on the Greek islands, having arrived after the deal was implemented\. So far under the EU\-Turkey deal, the [International Organisation for Migration](https://www.iom.int/news/syrian-resettlement-europe-picks-following-eu-turkey-agreement) \(IOM\) has helped to resettle 350 Syrians from Turkey to Austria, Denmark, and Germany\.

UNHCR and human rights organisations believe that this agreement does not provide refugees with legal protection, and Amnesty International called it a historic step back for human rights\._ 





> _“Turkey is not a safe country for its own citizens, let alone for refugees\. The media have recently published information about the behavior of the Turkish government towards Syrians, and warned of the killings of Syrians on the Turkish border and the return of refugees in war\-torn Syria\. Hosting the leader of a country who ruthlessly violates human rights in Turkey is unacceptable\!”_

It allows the government to declare a state of emergency if the influx of migrants to the country “threatens national security,” and allows asylum seekers to be rejected directly at the border\.

> [_Amnesty International condemns_](https://www.amnesty.org/.../04/austria-asylum-law-refugees/) _the new legislation, calling it a violation of international law, while [Human Rights Watch calls](https://www.hrw.org/.../austria-drastic-unjustified) it a “blow to the rights of asylum seekers”\. Judith Sunderland, acting deputy Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch, says “these measures constitute a legal wall to asylum just as despicable as a razor\-wire fence”, adding Austria should not take “unilateral decisions to pass asylum seekers around like hot potatoes\.”_

> _Austria plans to close the \#Brenner pass by building a 370 meter long fence and by starting to control toll\-free roads and railroads in addition to the highway, as it believes refugees will soon arrive in large numbers from North Africa to Europe\. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi says the number of migrants arriving to Italy do not justify Austria’s decision and calls it a ‘ [bold violation of EU rules](http://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/international/fluechtlinge-sollen-draussen-bleiben-oesterreich-schottet-sich-ab/13511176.html) ’\.

The decision is meant to prevent “refugees in orbit” who are unable to find a state willing to examine their asylum request\._

> [_DW reported_](http://www.dw.com/en/refugees-make-real-news-with-a-fake-camera-in-idomeni/a-19218582) _on the fake Refugee TV created by group of people living in Idomeni camp\. TV crew consists of several refugees conducting mock interviews through a wooden camera\. Refugee TV now has its own camera but still uses the wooden one during interviews\. Their first report includes a fake UN office and is available on their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/refugeestv-727710394037996/) \. But they also tried to fill a very real news void those journalists left behind\. “The refugees liked it,” said Refugees\.TV’s translator in [an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX_lOR_rfnw) with the Basque\-language news outlet Hala Bedi Irratiaren\. “It’s fake, everybody knows that, but they speak very seriously about certain topics\.”_
