#### Nothing change on the Greek Islands

Despite continuous claims by the Greek Government and EU authorities, and while still remembering [embarrassing statements of the Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras being proud of the living conditions of refugees on the islands](https://greece.greekreporter.com/2017/11/24/greek-pm-tsipras-i-am-proud-of-living-conditions-of-refugees-on-the-mainland/) , nothing there seems to change…

According to [National Statistics](http://mindigital.gr/index.php/%CF%80%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%86%CF%85%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C-%CE%B6%CE%AE%CF%84%CE%B7%CE%BC%CE%B1-refugee-crisis/3625-national-situational-picture-regarding-the-islands-at-eastern-aegean-sea-24-02-2019) 15,493 people are still on the facilities on the islands: 7252 on Lesvos, 1741 on Chios, 4294 on Samos, 1173 on Leros, 995 on Kos and 72 on other islands\.

**We learned to mistrust such statistics, especially while — on February 25th — they still state that no one is living in makeshift camps\.**

While government numbers count 4,294 people on Samos, ABR inform that it is likely that [more than 5,000 live on the island](https://www.facebook.com/AegeanBoatReport/posts/530978767425232?hc_location=ufi) , with [more than 1,000 children](https://twitter.com/samosvolunteers/status/1099980060487008257) without access to formal education or basic services\.

Two groups of sub\-Saharan people were [stopped by the police](https://www.facebook.com/AmdhNador/posts/2280989112113351) yesterday in the coastal town of Arekmane\. One group was of [30 people, the other of 40](https://twitter.com/alzoubeidi/status/1100073363589025793?fbclid=IwAR08WWopTJkbnzr5oNm3iGCYf-0ox_yP4s3Vz6resUDACdrMd-L7YYIqCOA) \.

SEA
#### Sea\-Watch still at bay

SeaWatch is now in France for maintenance operations\.

The Dutch government, the flag\-state of SeaWatch, lifted their illegal blockade of our ship in Italy, after being pressured by the rescue boat crew and their supporters\.

However, they still show every intention of arbitrarily hindering SeaWatch from resuming rescue operations even after planned maintenance in France ends\. [\#FreeTheShips](https://twitter.com/hashtag/FreeTheShips?src=hash)

#### Aegean Boat Report Fundraiser

The more the ‘refugee crisis’ is forgotten by mainstream media, the more the daily information on arrivals relayed by Aegean Boat Report is key to understanding the situation in the Aegean Sea and on the Eastern Greek islands\.

They are fundraising to support their activities, help them out [HERE](https://www.facebook.com/donate/2262549667345848/530935690762873/) \.

ITALY
#### Alternative accommodation unsuitable after eviction in Florence

Following up from the eviction of the Pergolino building on 21st February 2018, [MEDU — Medici per i Diritti Umani report](https://www.facebook.com/groups/47002095664/permalink/10156133461140665/) that the conditions in the alternative accommodation offered to those who had been residing in the evicted building are unsuitable, especially considering that among them there is a small child with a severe kidney malformation\.


> Despite what is reported to the press, not all vulnerable people have been adequately supported by the authorities, especially minors\. 





Villa Pepi, accommodation managed by Caritas, where the evicted families now ‘temporarily’ reside, is not adequate for the health situation of the child: there is mould in the rooms, there are no private bathrooms, maintenance works are underway in part of the building, with dust and rubble left in the common spaces, and ‘deafening noises’ near the child’s room\. There are no washing machines or a usable kitchen\.

**MEDU demands for the minor, together with his/her family, to be urgently transferred to suitable accommodation, where life\-saving therapies can take place\.**

GERMANY
#### Hate Crimes 10 times more likely in East than West

According to recent research from the Leibniz Centre for European Economic Research \(ZEW\) and [shared by Info migrants](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/15363/germany-s-east-10-times-more-unsafe-for-asylum-seekers?fbclid=IwAR1w1I7tTDLXZRwQ-N6Mwcaum2zCkKlAmL5hj1yQ9IjWphYrVwkgQW1g47E) , asylum\-seekers in eastern Germany are 10 times more likely to experience hate crimes than those who live in the west\. Hate crimes have included hate speech, offensive graffiti, physical assault, and arson attacks\.

The researchers believe the reasons behind the attacks are often historic and reflect past migration flows\. Areas less used to migration have higher rates of hate crimes\.
#### Gambian migrants in live in fear of deportation

A total of 2,500 rejected Gambian asylum seekers are due to be deported from the Baden\-Württemberg Region, [Gambian media reports](https://standard.gm/?p=53259&fbclid=IwAR2socVvOT9k8S-Lyg4mxYQX_CqdBNqKeLH3oeL5ImScdE4_RBoM0LOy4oo) in collaboration with a Gambian activist [Yahya Sonka](https://www.facebook.com/yahya.sonko.129/posts/3093505020734374?__tn__=K-R) and Gambians Refugee Association in Europe\. It is likely that deportations will take place at the end of February\. As a result, many are too scared to sleep in their homes, fearing that they will be taken in the night, and so are sleeping on the streets in the cold\.
