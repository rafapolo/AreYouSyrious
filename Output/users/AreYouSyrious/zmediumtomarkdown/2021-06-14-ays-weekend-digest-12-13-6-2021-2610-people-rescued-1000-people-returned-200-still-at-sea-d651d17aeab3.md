Let them reach a place of safety now. Show humanity and allow the immediate disembarkation https://t.co/VTbMNqiKDl

■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 


Four of the rescue operations were carried out in Maltese waters, but the island’s authorities [refused](https://twitter.com/MSF_Sea/status/1404155615484727296) to give MSF any support or a place of safety\. Alarm Phone reported they were in contact with three more boats in the area on Saturday\. At least one other boat carrying 100 people has [contacted](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1404058286064816132) Alarm Phone on Sunday and are still missing\.

1200 people also arrived to Lampedusa over 24 hours between Saturday and Sunday\. They were brought to the small Italian island in 16 different operations, media [report](https://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2021/06/13/news/migranti_16_sbarchi_in_24_ore_a_lampedusa-305816883/) \.

In the Atlantic, Alarm Phone [report](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1404058286064816132?fbclid=IwAR3VwgToPYQtbkDdX27nALXMoQjOrYLIbJXm9td97bmAWSlHd-lqoqTnx0Y) that the Spanish rescue agency Salvamento Maritimo has launched a rescue operation for a further 36 people who left Sidi Ifni and for 67 who left Laayoune\. Due to lack of funding and resources, the agency can only search for one boat at the time\. None of the people have been found yet\.


> Where are they now? 




So far 811 people are known to have died at sea in 2021:

> > El resultado de bloquear 5 barcos humanitarios: en lo que va de 2021 son 811 muertos casi igual que todo el 2019 (918) y más que todas las muertes registradas en 2018 (793). Sin estridencias mediáticas, el tándem Draghi/Lamorgese está siendo mucho peor que Conte/Salvini.  #LaHaya

Italian media [report](https://ilmanifesto.it/la-guardia-costiera-tedesca-la-sea-eye-4-e-una-nave-sicura/) that, for the first time, the German coast guard took a stand on the seizing of German\-flagged rescue ships in Italy\. A representative of the German coast guard stated that the SEA\-EYE 4, currently blocked by Italian authorities is safe and that Italian authorities are interpreting ambiguously the SOLAS \(Safety of Life at Sea\) convention\.

On Saturday, Sea Watch’s aircraft Sea Bird [witnessed](https://twitter.com/seawatchcrew/status/1403747877122461698) a Libyan coast guard vessel entering Maltese waters to carry out an illegal interception\. It also witnessed around 100 people being rescued by the merchant ship UGUR DADALY and more vessels in distress\.

On Saturday alone, 1000 people were [intercepted](https://twitter.com/UNHCRLibya/status/1403846177158742021) and brought back to Libya in 5 operations \(2 to Zawiya and 3 to Tripoli\) \. The Libyan Observer has reported that there are currently [700,000 people](https://www.libyaobserver.ly/news/700000-illegal-immigrants-residing-libya-interior-minister-says?fbclid=IwAR1YdjriL-cYSy7TGJnFN-2U2U_q0LphPKq0UHtcc4SbSUU7ZU_Q5QdSFnM) on the move in Libya and only a small percentage try to leave\. As usual, the weight of the burden remains on a country struggling to support its own people while Europe turns a blind eye\.

GREECE
#### Kos, a new camp around the old

Petra Molnar [report](https://twitter.com/_PMolnar/status/1403692443820871684) how “the tourist destination of Kos hides a forgotten camp, holding over 300 people, breaking their phone cameras and normalizing detention on arrival\.” A new camp is being built around the old site in Pili, while at the same time EU funding has financed an automated surveillance system patrolling waters between the island and Turkey\.

MONTENEGRO
#### Update from No Name Kitchen

No Name Kitchen \(NNK\) have been in contact with a group of people on the move, who had improvised a makeshift shelter\. When the police found them, they were cooking food on an open fire\.


> “One policemen threw the boiling water into the fire\. People were sitting around the fire and two of them just got hit by the boiling water\. They got badly burned”\. 





The NNK team facilitated medical treatments for the injured people, which cost €120\.

#### Mistreatment and abuse in Ellebaek pre\-deportation centre

Afghanistan Migrants Advice & Support Org \(AMASO\) met in Kabul with 5 people recently deported from Denmark\. They complained of mistreatment in the Ellebaek detention centre, with arbitrary use of solitary confinement\. They also explained how they were violently forced to take a COVID\-19 test and were severely abused on the day of the deportation\.
