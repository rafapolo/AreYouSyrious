### FEATURE: Mediterranean rescue crews kept busy

It has been a busy day for crossings in the Mediterranean Sea with reports of boats being spotted and rescued from Gibraltar to the Greek islands\.

On Saturday afternoon the Spanish coastguards rescued 224 refugees as they attempted to make the crossing from North Africa to Europe\. The arrivals were rescued from five vessels in the Strait of Gibraltar and the Alboran Sea, which separate Spain and Morocco\. The first rescues occurred in the early hours, with dozens rescued south of Gibraltar from three boats and another 72 rescued later after being spotted by a plane belonging to Europe’s border agency, Frontex\. Another 400 people had been rescued in this area just last week, according to the same source\.

The Alboran Sea—a relatively short sea crossing from Morocco to Spain—is a popular route\. According to the International Organization for Migration \(IOM\), 3,314 people attempted this crossing between January 1 and April 30 this year alone\. 59 people were unfortunately reported dead\.

Many boats were recently spotted by rescuers in the central Mediterranean, with—as usual—several teams involved in the pursuant rescue operations\. [MOAS](https://twitter.com/moas_eu) reported a very intense day, with more than 30 boats found\. Their vessel, _Phoenix_ , and its crew were working since early in the morning\. After a long day the vessel headed back north with more than 400 men, women, and children on board, all recovering from the dangerous crossing\.

[MSF Sea](https://twitter.com/MSF_Sea) has also reported several boats in the area, including a huge wooden boat with hundreds of people on board\. [Ärzte ohne Grenzen / Médecins Sans Frontières \(MSF\)](https://www.facebook.com/aerzteohnegrenzenMSF/?fref=mentions) , [Save the Children Italia](https://www.facebook.com/savethechildrenitalia/?fref=mentions) , [Sea\-Watch](https://www.facebook.com/seawatchprojekt/?fref=mentions) , [sea\-eye\.org](https://www.facebook.com/seaeyeorg/?fref=mentions) , and [Jugend Rettet e\.V\.](https://www.facebook.com/JugendRettet/?fref=nf) were also involved in the operations today to try to avoid the tragedies we constantly see at sea\.


> Right now our crew is supplying a wooden boat with 500 people, while on our ship there are about 250 people\.

MSF also stated that after the rescue effort they had many children on board, including a baby only one month old\.

[MEDU — Medici per i Diritti Umani](https://www.facebook.com/MEDUonlus/) \(Doctors for Human Rights\) have also reported back since docking in Pozzallo port in Sicily a few hours ago, where they brought 267 refugees rescued from international waters close to the Libyan coast\. The origins of those MEDU rescued were very diverse\. Among the countries represented were Bangladesh, Gambia, Mali, Nigeria, Togo, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, Niger, Pakistan, Senegal, Ethiopia, Somalia, Guinea Conakry, Guinea Bissau, Liberia, Burkina Faso, Chad, Cameroon, and Morocco\. Those rescued were considered especially vulnerable—among those on board including more than 60 minors and 30 women, four of whom were pregnant\. Several persons are victims of violence, such as torture, sexual violence, and inhuman and degrading treatment\. MEDU’s medical\-psychological team recently helped to care for a Gambian teenager—about 16 years old—who suffered from severe malnutrition and dehydration after both imprisonment in Libya and the strenuous journey they endured\.
### GREECE
#### New arrivals

The eastern Mediterranean also saw many arrivals over the weekend\. This morning the Greek Coast Guard picked up a boat along the southeast coast of Lesbos and rescued the 66 refugees on board, including 10 men, 11 women, and 45 children\. Volunteers reported that everyone was in good health\.

There were also some arrivals on the small island of Tilos in the early hours of Saturday\. According to volunteers, some families—including those with children—were dumped by smugglers on the island at 2am, only to be found at lunchtime by the police before being assisted by doctors and volunteers\. The families lit a fire at night since they were in the dark and all very scared, especially the children\.

As reported yesterday, another boat with about 120 refugees was spotted and rescued by the Greek Coast Guard close to the island of Karpathos\.

### SERBIA

We bring good news from Serbia as Ramadan comes to an end and people are in a celebratory mood, even if their situations remain quite dire\.

They have so far treated 101 patients in the area\. If you would like support their work, please do so by following the link above\.
### HUNGARY

Once again, news from this country is not good\. László Torockai, the far right mayor of the Hungarian village Ásotthalom, near the Serbian border, posted the photo below regarding a small group of refugees who tried to enter Hungary from Serbia\. The refugees met with Torockai’s paramilitary “defence” group, who quickly forced them to the ground\. Later they pushed them back to Serbia\. According to human rights organizations, vigilantes in the area often terrorize refugees who seek asylum in Hungary — now we can see that they are even proud of it\!

### FRANCE
#### No new reception centre in Calais

French President Emmanuel Macron’s new government took a tough line on Calais’ migrants Friday, with his interior minister saying he does not want the northern port to become an “abscess\.” Despite the fact that hundreds of refugees and migrants are living in Calais in desperate conditions, the French government has vowed there will be no new welcome centre built\. Instead, security will be reinforced\.

Hundreds of refugees— mostly Afghans, Eritreans, and Ethiopians — are still at the port, clashing sporadically with police as they try every night to stow away onto trucks heading to Britain\.

Eleven charities went to court on Wednesday demanding the construction of a government refugee centre in Calais, deploring the miserable conditions in which migrants find themselves\. Collomb had angered aid groups with comments Thursday rejecting the proposal, saying that building such a centre would be like creating an artificial festering “abscess” that would keep growing\.


> “These people are not a disease, they are not dirt\. They are men and women who have made a very difficult journey to flee their countries for reasons we all know about” 




Hicham Aly, an aid worker at the Secours Catholique charity, echoes back with the words above\.

It appears that the new government will continue to implement the same, old policies towards refugees in France and that conditions are not likely to improve any time soon\.
### UK
#### Refugees at Home urgently looking for a host

[Refugees at Home](https://www.facebook.com/refugeesathome/?fref=nf) are urgently looking to find a host in London near to, or within an easy commute of, Bloomsbury\.


> We have a guest who needs to be near her premature baby who is being cared for at UCH\. Currently mum is an inpatient in a different hospital\. We are not sure when precisely she will be discharged so when we need the placement to start, but we want to be ready for her so she can spend as much time with her baby as possible\. We don’t know how long she’ll need hosting either, but, for obvious reasons, we don’t want a series of short term placements—we’d love a host who can be pretty flexible so she has some stability\.
