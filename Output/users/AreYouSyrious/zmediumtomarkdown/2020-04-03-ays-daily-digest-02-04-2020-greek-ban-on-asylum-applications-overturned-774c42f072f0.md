### FEATURE — People Who Arrived in Greece in March Will Be Able to Apply for Asylum, EU Commissioner Says

In a video conference from the European Parliament’s LIBE Committee, Ylva Johansson discussed the situation at the EU’s external borders in Greece and how the EU plans to handle the situation going forward\.

Something she said that will hopefully bring relief to many people is that those who came to Greece in March will be able to [apply for asylum](https://www.facebook.com/europemustact/photos/a.104489524497084/124893292456707/?type=3&theater) after all, which is a reversal of Greece’s previous law\.

The commissioner also outlined an ambitious plan to help Greece curtail the spread of COVID\-19 in camps, which appeared in Ritsona camp yesterday\. She announced that the EU will send money and medical equipment to Greece\. Vulnerable people such as the elderly and the sick will be [relocated](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2019-2024/johansson/announcements/intervention-video-conference-european-parliament-libe-committee-situation-unions-external-borders_en?fbclid=IwAR0RJPpQszz4Jk9QYjsdHVN2N-fHJA1hwk8dr2aB8ywczXyBbZZY1d1apXM) to hotel rooms in order to separate them from unsanitary conditions in the camps\. Relocations of unaccompanied minors that were promised weeks ago should start this week — “before Easter, at the least”\. Given how long just the resettlement of unaccompanied minors has dragged on, it could be some time before these measures are implemented\.

She said that although the primary responsibility to fix the situation in Greece lies with the Greek government, the EU and international organizations must [help as well\.](https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-eu-must-do-everything-to-avoid-an-outbreak-in-refugee-camps-warns-commissioner-ylva-johansson/a-52998262?fbclid=IwAR1fZdKQYBy7COgYmetXcnSARkjo0CKUR1aKYZndnuh8W77nNE38goqz8yw) The commissioner stressed the importance of solidarity and tolerance even in times of crisis and condemned xenophobia against people on the move\.

However, before her message calling for tolerance and solidarity, Johansson announced that part of the money will be used to build new detention centers, increase border guards, and strengthen Frontex missions\. Even in a time of crisis, the EU’s border security apparatus, known for its violent actions against vulnerable people, must be funded\.

Despite the overturning of one unjust law, violent and discriminatory practices at the Greek border and in Greek courts of law continue\. Greek newspapers [reported](https://www.efsyn.gr/node/237574) that the government is preparing a second asylum law that is also strict and against international law\. People who lived in a third country for over two months without prosecution will automatically have their applications rejected\. If an asylum seeker requests an interview in their native language but it is not an official language of their country of origin, the interview will not be given — a practice that will discriminate against ethnic minorities\. There will also be less legal aid available and more conditions under which people can be detained\.

Illegal and potentially deadly pushbacks are continuing in Greece \.Aegean Boat Report [reported](https://www.facebook.com/AegeanBoatReport/posts/803373893519050?hc_location=ufi) that a boat carrying about 25 people landed on Samos yesterday morning, yet no arrivals were officially reported\. Later, the Turkish Coast Guard picked up 25 people on a life raft who claimed they had been turned away from Samos\. Seven similar cases have been reported by the Turkish Coast Guard in the past week — people clinging to life rafts who claimed they had landed somewhere in Greece where no official arrivals were registered\. Not only does this violate international law by not allowing people to so much as apply for asylum, the flimsy life rafts could easily capsize and drown those on board\.

Commissioner Johansson did not address these instances of border violence or the new proposed law in her speech\. Perhaps she was not aware of them yet\.

GREECE
### Coronavirus Hits Unprepared Camps

As coronavirus begins to hit detention centers and camps in Greece, authorities still aren’t prepared\. First cases on the islands of Mykonos and Kos were both [confirmed](https://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2020/04/02/coronavirus-mykonos-kos/#.XoYm_uNmXkc.facebook) on Tuesday, although not in the camps\. The case on Mykonos was especially worrisome because the infected woman had not traveled away from Mykonos recently\.

In Moria, Starfish Foundation are providing cleansing stations, but they are not enough for everyone in the overcrowded camp\. Some sources are [reporting](https://twitter.com/MortazaBehboudi/status/1245810496722407426?fbclid=IwAR2h7au0oqkZ9m76QLkvQxkc_bZontrtTcIiApw-Hdvpw-b-cf3x-YcaSyo) that there has not been running water in the camp for at least 23 hours\.

The IOM has [expressed concern](https://twitter.com/dgatopoulos/status/1245818308701687813?fbclid=IwAR0lzjtzb1sCOv-g9FGRMvcEM5Coi5YYq9hTaHz0Nc7M8VuqIElz0NIa5CQ) over the appearance of coronavirus in Greek camps and announced it’s stepping up its work, such as translating information and providing soap to residents\. Alongside the EU, it is promoting voluntary return as a measure to prevent the spread of the coronavirus\. This choice seems incredibly cynical in light of all that is happening\. If authorities are truly concerned about overcrowding in the camps, they could house people in hotels that are now empty all across Greece\. It is unclear how voluntary return would be if people are fearing for their lives in crowded, unsanitary camps\. Finally, people being returned could unknowingly carry the virus back to their countries of origin that in general have even less resources to cope with an epidemic than Greece\.

Instead of helping with resources and aid, authorities are punishing the most vulnerable\. Two groups of people in the Chios camps were [fined](http://www.ekathimerini.com/251269/article/ekathimerini/news/police-on-chios-fine-refugees-5000-euros-over-kids-parties?fbclid=IwAR0BrvQUTGONjSb566Ss5mWlN1EkwoovK4eY9Y8paoGnaBmcPiH8WlnA1t0) 5,000 euros per person for violating measures of social distancing by throwing birthday parties for children\. Birthday parties during a pandemic may seem irresponsible to an outside observer, but many camp residents do not have access to accurate information about coronavirus and may not know why these measures are in place\. Proper social distancing is impossible in the overcrowded camps anyway\. Paying this fine will be very difficult for these people and could potentially affect the status of future asylum applications\. Two children’s birthday parties cannot damage public health as much as years of neglect by the Greek government has\. To fine desperate people looking to give their children small moments of joy seems cruel and unnecessary\.

Increased police presence and confinement will just contribute to the atmosphere of hopelessness and the mental health crisis [already](https://www.facebook.com/aiddeliverymission/posts/1135008556831981?hc_location=ufi) in the camps\.

People with white cards from the Greek government will still receive money in April and May\. The normal requirements of signing periodically to confirm you are still in Greece are waived for now because of coronavirus\. For more information, as well as who to contact if you have questions or problems, see Mobile Info Team’s [post](https://www.facebook.com/mobileinfoteam/posts/2718713638357348?hc_location=ufi) \.

The Greek Council for Refugees has set up an [online helpdesk](https://www.facebook.com/notes/refucomm/greece-asylum-helpdesk-greek-council-for-refugees/1093719867646481/?hc_location=ufi) for people who need assistance with asylum applications, integration into Greece, and psychological support\.

The Multi\-functional Center for Refugees and Migrants has set up a [hotline](https://www.facebook.com/notes/refucomm/help-for-refugees-multi-functional-center-for-refugees-and-migrants-mfc/1093733957645072/?hc_location=ufi) that provides information for people on the move in 12 different languages\.

SEA
### NGOs Restart Sea Rescue Operations

Despite fears of the coronavirus epidemic, the Alan Kurdi rescue ship has set sail [again](https://www.facebook.com/refucomm/posts/1093717607646707) \. Sea\-Eye’s boat, currently the only NGO rescue ship in the Central Mediterranean, should reach waters close to the Libyan coast by the weekend\. [The crew](https://sea-eye.org/en/alan-kurdi-underway-for-its-next-mission/?fbclid=IwAR2F9B-e5dOa0LFp1yMOpMBSrl5POboRZX-2oRXg4u4bQ9kFAiyTk8jCXK8) says they have enough protective equipment aboard and have prepared for rescue conditions during the epidemic\.

BOSNIA & HERZEGOVINA
### Coronavirus’ Impact on People on the Move in Bosnia

The epidemic caused an increase in already high levels of xenophobia in Bosnia against people on the move\. People are permanently confined to camps, which have finally increased in capacity after years of organizations advocating for more beds\. Even the increase in 1000 beds in Blazuj alone are not enough\. People are turned away from overcrowded camps only to be violently arrested by police, and the cycle continues\.

Some groups of volunteers, such as MiGreat/Aid Belgrade, are continuing to provide supplies\. They are asking for [donations](https://www.facebook.com/migreatorg/photos/a.1845099678932346/2854144318027872/?type=3&theater) to support their work\.

[Sources](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2367583793533639&set=a.1505249269767100&type=3&theater) from Grand\-Synthe camp tell harrowing stories of disease, government neglect and violence\. Last night, a man had to be taken to the hospital to treat severe shortness of breath — unclear yet if it was caused by coronavirus or not\. If there is coronavirus in the camp, the crowded conditions shown above mean it will spread quickly\. The ambulance took ages to come, and volunteers say it is common that medical treatment is slow or nonexistent\. The night before, paramedics refused to treat a young boy who was beaten by the police\.

This government violence and neglect must stop before even more people die\. To refuse medical treatment during a deadly epidemic is inhumane\!

SPAIN
### Unsafe Living Conditions in Melilla

No Name Kitchen reported on the unsanitary conditions people detained in Melilla are suffering\. After being detained in a sports center, many were moved outside the city as punishment for trying to raise their spirits during confinement\. In the new detention center, there is water inside the booths they live in, cold, and inadequate food supplies\. Disturbing photos can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/NoNameKitchenBelgrade/posts/950911781973773) \.

GENERAL
### EU Court of Justice Rules Against Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic

The court [ruled](https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2020-04/cp200040en.pdf?fbclid=IwAR0EjCWQTUc6Pz_neBKdSZ2Ae74DVxWKlgEV_F1m2dB_k2HyFX0VwfZ8F90) that the three countries failed to “fulfil their obligations under European Union law” by refusing to accept asylum seekers being relocated from Greece and Italy in 2015\. Further action will be decided by the European Commission, which [began](https://www.dw.com/en/central-european-states-broke-eu-law-by-refusing-refugees/a-52989354?fbclid=IwAR2IXSIA_Qqmslig4SvulJyD77HHuceH2GJk3-Hz2bvZBxb-BrqMNcvvDE0) legal proceedings against the three in 2017\. All three national governments have [stated](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/world/europe/european-court-refugees-hungary-poland-czech-republic.html?fbclid=IwAR3_Sbd9yWWsoP1sqtybZJHszNsheCKBQ6GUqhPdb-ltuxZMUBQSGtvcjIA) their continued defiance and refusal to accept people on the move \(linked article is behind a paywall\) \.

On March 31st, the EU announced [Operation IRINI](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/03/31/eu-launches-operation-irini-to-enforce-libya-arms-embargo/?fbclid=IwAR1bFJ8JmNF_sn-Evtk7CVPZZkDGLuiX_O5MmK3h23eoIWRVNld39ouZFUc) , its mission to enforce the Libyan arms embargo\. Its goals also include stopping illegal exports of petroleum, training the Libyan Coast Guard and Navy \(which has been accused of countless human rights violations, including torture and murder\), and “disrupting” human trafficking operations\. The EU was silent when it came to discussing the operation’s effects on people on the move\. A spokesperson said arrangements [have been made](https://euobserver.com/migration/147955) about where to disembark people rescued at sea, but they will not be shared with the public\. Given the EU’s stated commitment to working with the Libyan Coast Guard, it is not hopeful that these “secret arrangements” are taking people’s human rights into account\.

[Here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Credit4Refugees/') is a Facebook group providing phone credit to people on the move\. They are seeking donations\.
