#### Feature

The latest of the long string of large\-scale deaths associated with the Mediterranean route happened on Thursday, when two rubber dinghies were reported to have sunken off the coast of Italy\. This brings the yearly total to over 5,000, or, an average of 14 deaths per day\. This number is far greater than it was in 2015, when 3,800 deaths were reported\. This increase comes despite a decrease in the overall number of people making the crossing attempt, indicating that smugglers are resorting to even more dangerous methods\.

The increase in deaths indicates a failure on the part of the EU to give these people safer means of reaching Europe to claim asylum\. Dublin regulations bar these people from making the crossing by plane, for example\. This gives the refugees, who flee from their home countries for a myriad of reasons, no safe alternative\. Europe is currently stepping up its efforts of keeping those refugees who made it as far as Libya from boarding the ships, through the construction of camps and by offering economic incentives for the potential asylum seekers to go home\. However, Libya as hardly a safe place for these people to remain, as the country is currently engulfed in a civil war waged by multiple competing governments as well as armed militias, with no end in sight\.
#### Lebanon
### Refugees in Lebanon struggle to cope with harsh winter conditions\.

The UNHCR has released a [harrowing article](http://www.unhcr.org/news/latest/2016/12/585cddcf4/winter-blows-across-lebanon-refugees-struggle.html) about the plight of Syrian refugees as winter quickly approaches\. There are currently over one million Syrian refugees in Lebanon, over half of whom live in structures, such as tents, animal sheds, and garages, that are not suited for staying safe during winter\. UNHCR is currently providing aid for 850,000 people, but resources are stretched thin, and the agency is currently [collecting donations](https://donate.unhcr.org/gu-en/warmth/#_ga=1.36598624.1930055785.1463055264) \.

### Athens offers makeshift solution for homeless facing cold weather

As a cold wave approaches, the city of Athens has announced that community centers at Mamouri and Dymis streets and at 35 Alexandras Avenue will be kept open aroun the clock until the cold subsides\. The homeless shelter is also handing out food, clothing, and bedding to the homeless\. More information may be found by dialing the 1595 hotline\.
### 1,200 refugee children have completed their first trimester of school

An additional 600 are expected to begin schooling after the winter break\. These numbers constitute a small minority of the refugee children currently stranded in Greece, many of whom went for years without an education because of unrest and war in their own home countries\. One hopes that the program will be greatly expanded to give refugee children a chance to integrate into society and to keep them occupied, rather than idle and bored in the camps\.

### Home available for 4–5 refugees in Malvern\!


> _REFUGEE SUPPORT FRIENDS — REFUGEE HOME AVAILABLE NOW\!_ 
 

> _So, really need your help\. I have the opposite of the Christmas tale here\. instead of no room at the inn, we have no guests at the inn\!_ 
 

> _A home is available immediately for a refugee family in Malvern, Worcestershire\. it will be let conventionally very soon if no family is found_ 
 

> _Refugee action will not refer anyone as they deem Malvern unsuitable, and the family reunification we had lined up has fallen through due to visa nightmares\._ 
 

> _Other possibles have decided it is too far from their own communities/network_ 
 

> _So, we have a few days before this house goes back up for conventional letting and the opportunity to start a refugee community here is lost\._ 
 

> _It is suitable for a family to settle, \(it is not available to an individual\), 4–5 people ideally, 6 at a push as it has 2/3 bedrooms\. its is small, but a nice property, really well equipped, in a beautiful area, between the town and the hills and walkable distance to schools, train stations, buses, shops, library etc\. Malvern is a large town in stunning countryside, by no means out in the sticks… there are 2/3 other properties probably becoming available in Malvern in April, and a refugee support hub setting up in the new year, so everything is moving in the right direction\. There is a syrian refugee community nearby who a family can be connected with\. We have esol teachers lined up, are researching employment opportunities, and have a large support network available_ 
 

> _We do not have a mosque should it be wanted, though there is a church that offers friday prayers, and things like Halal are tricky, but we have volunteers willing to help with shopping trips to the nearby city, and mosques, and you can get there by train in ten minutes_ 
 

> _Criteria… it needs to be a refugee family in need of housing and support to live independently, and all families would be subject to an assessment to see what support is required, affordability checks etc, Spring Housing are very happy to facilitate a visit if somebody would like to view the property\._
