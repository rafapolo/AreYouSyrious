#### FEATURE —

As part of their yearly budget, the Danish government has unveiled a new plan, seemingly modelled on Australia’s offshore detention centers, to house asylum seekers in removal centers on the isolated island of Lindholm\. The center will be established over the course of the next three years and will eventually house asylum seekers from the controversial Kærshovedgård deportation center\.

Australia’s Nauru Island has been a travesty — first and foremost for the people detained there, whose rights and dignity have been violated a hundred times over, but also for Australian taxpayers\. Denmark’s desire to replicate such a failed model is unfathomable\. However, the Danish government is already justifying their proposal for an offshore detention center by relying on rhetoric about threats to community safety, stressing the criminality of the people who will be held on Lindholm — despite the fact that the vast majority of those currently held at Kærshovedgård are not criminals at all\. In fact, as of October 1st, over 150 out of 241 Kærshovedgård residents were asylum seekers whose claims had been deemed insufficient\.

“We send the criminals who are living on an island where there are no other people they can bother,” said Justice Minister Søren Pape Poulsen\. “It is good for security and it is good for the citizens who have experienced how these people have been very disturbing… There has been too much turmoil and insecurity around Kærshovedgård\.” The mayor of the town rejects this characterization, saying that crime has not risen in the region\. It seems more probable that the government just wishes to keep the spectacle of asylum rejections and detentions out of the public eye\.

Though the plan has not yet passed into law, it is supported by Denmark’s second\-most powerful political party, the populist DPP\. The budget could be rejected, which would trigger parliamentary elections, but this has never happened before\. It appears that this ill\-conceived, dehumanizing plan is all but guaranteed to be put into action — the only thing left to do is register dissent\.

**Information for refugees:**

If you have asylum in Greece, can you find work in another European country? Answer: it’s possible, but complicated — and difficult\. The Mobile Info Team [explains](https://www.facebook.com/mobileinfoteam/posts/2325035524391830) in detail, in Urdu, Pashto, and English\.

The organization Faros, which supports unaccompanied refugee youth in Athens, has released a new video with helpful information for children about what their rights are as children, how they deserve to be treated, and where to ask for help \(In Farsi with English subtitles\):

#### Italy

A lot of news from Italy today, by turns hopeful and sobering\.

**The Humanitarian corridor successfully brought 70 more refugees from Lebanon to Rome\.** This is an invaluable initiative that spares displaced people the danger, anxiety, expense, and inevitable trauma that accompanies an overland crossing\. Watch live footage of the arrivals below:

“ _Almost one year after our arrival, we have to leave Rome\. The informal camp, known as Baobab, was closed 20 days ago, and the present situation in Rome doesn’t allow us to keep working in the streets of Rome\. The day when our colleagues from Baobab experience can create a new camp where we are needed, we will be back again, with our van and all our motivation\._

_We would like to summarise this last year at Roma Tiburtina, highlighting what the daily life at the camp meant for the more than 30 volunteers that have been working for the No Name Kitchen\. We need to point out that it hasn’t been an easy task\. It is the opposite\. However, we feel satisfied, not for having cooked, bringing water or firewood to the camp, but for having been part of their family\. We have made a difference at no cost\. The love we have shared is priceless\. In conclusion, our presence has been our best contribution to the life at the camp\._ ”

**A top\-secret Italy\-Niger accord signed last year must go public, the Administrative Tribunal of Lazio ruled\.**

The contents of the diplomatic & military cooperation deal, which was signed between Italy and Niger in September 2017, will [have to be published](https://cild.eu/blog/2018/11/28/laccordo-italia-niger-deve-essere-pubblico/?platform=hootsuite&fbclid=IwAR32UlqQHc2vlqrDfMacTvvlJAz50IijKgcBg5INho53kqPAt1YiG3xqtWQ) by December 16, 2018\. This ruling is a success for Italian civil liberties groups, which sued the government after the accord remained classified\. Meanwhile, Italian troops are already on the ground in Niger\.

So far, only one aspect of the agreement has been [made public](https://www.lastampa.it/2018/11/27/italia/niente-accordo-top-secret-il-tar-rende-pubblica-lintesa-tra-italia-e-niger-DrSivyTpawjlDvEHYBY9IL/pagina.html?fbclid=IwAR0iBkFj4RMZf0Nq5YjnYCTnba3CgKiDTv0jgbwVYOYR6-XL21LuFKcC0cw) thus far: Italian troops will train and support their counterparts in Niger to contain “illegal migration flows to Europe from West and Subsaharan Africa\.”

In other words, more policies of border externalization from the EU, which regularly pays the countries just beyond its borders to manage migration so that the EU doesn’t have to risk its image as a paragon of human rights and international law\.

**The “Salvini Decree” was [voted into law](http://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/13670/italy-clamps-down-on-immigration-as-new-security-decree-becomes-law?fbclid=IwAR0iBkFj4RMZf0Nq5YjnYCTnba3CgKiDTv0jgbwVYOYR6-XL21LuFKcC0cw) , likely creating a more hostile climate for asylum seekers across Italy\.**

In the name of security, the new decree further politicizes citizenship in a number of ways: extending the application procedure from 2 to 4 years, requiring applicants to speak Italian, and stripping the citizenship of Italians convicted of terrorism\.

The law also includes measures that facilitate the following: asylum revocation for people convicted of crimes including non\-violent theft and criminalized begging; suspension of asylum proceedings for those who are involved in a criminal case; further criminalization of squatting; expansion of the use of surveillance against squatters, and finally, restrictions to the SPRAR system for unaccompanied minors and beneficiaries of international protection\.

**Finally, a new calendar featuring the images from \#Medfaces campaign was released\.**

**Report from Kladuša:**

“ _SOS volunteers spend every days of trying to support materially but also to encourage and embrace the a lots of people who need concrete care but also deep care of their soul\._

_Every day SOS’s volunteers take care of the realization and organization of meals, the distribution of dry and warm clothes and shoes, but they also work to treat the injuries caused by the passage in the forests or inflicted by the Croatian police at the border, providing basic medical care: the team of Sos Kladuša have in fact opened a first aid point for those in need\._

_Still not enough to feed the people and keep them from freezing_ \.”

Sarajevo on a winter’s night\. Photo: BASIS

**Report from Sarajevo:**

“It has been cold the past three\-four days, but not as bad as the forecast first said \( \-14\) \. Now the temperature will go up again, at least for a bit\. People are still both arriving and leaving, but the trend seems to be pointing towards a more steady number\.

Snug packs have been distributed \(thanks to Catch a Smile\) and a second big blanket distribution was done two nights ago to make sure that everyone has two blankets each\. Support \(from BASIS and AidBrigade\) in squats continues as temperatures drop, people who intend to stay throughout the winter needs to make it warmer for the upcoming cold months\. If someone is encountered on either the streets or distro evening time, they are suggested places where to sleep — as it is full in the camp, no buses are going there after around 8 pm, and it is too cold to sleep out in the open\.

During the evening distributions, everybody is cold, the difference is that us, the volunteers, can go back home and recover easily\. Not everyone have the same possibility\. Food packs might soon become reality instead of street distro\-food for those who can manage to cook for themselves\. The first case of frostbite has already been seen\. It is hard to tell people off while they are cold — but we need to have a threshold as the stock is far from unlimited\. Winter has just started…”
#### Croatia

The artists Žarka Radoja and Mario Cvjetković will be presenting a new piece of performance art tomorrow, **Saturday December 1 at 8pm in Zagreb\.** The piece deals with the loss of identity, both individual and collective, that accompanies forced migration\. More information, in English and Croatian, on the events page below:

#### Austria

Refugee youth are being relocated from the controversial Drasenhofen housing site after the Children and Youth Prosecutor’s office determined that the facility was unsuitable, according to [Die Presse\.](https://diepresse.com/home/innenpolitik/5539183/Fluechtlinge-aus-Drasenhofen-werden-abgesiedelt?fbclid=IwAR0-QG3qDvfKe1v_nQHFC5Sh04hEW-xrsdPP0M2ar6HOi3-hT-GiNabFCoY)

“Even young people in the asylum procedure and those with a legally negative asylum decision have — as all other young people — a right to adequate youth\-friendly care, even if they are accused of misconduct,” said youth advocate Gabriela Peter Schofsky\-Orange in response to the decision\. Refugees could still be moved back to the facility in the future if the improvements made are judged to be sufficient\.
#### France

**Sexual abuse of minors on the streets of Paris:**

Minors sleeping rough on the streets of Paris are at especially high risk of falling prey to sexual predation and abuse, according to [InfoMIE](http://www.infomie.net/spip.php?breve3014&lang=fr&fbclid=IwAR1rIGRcz7Y-4y89eVHssqVImnozCiQJEsK1e-m0C3BwF6DBi-woDsAaDjg) \. Those who have just arrived in the city and don’t have their bearings yet are probably the most vulnerable — “They’re so lost that they’re likely to accept help from the first person who offers it,” says Anjela, who works for the organization Utopie56\. Utopie56 and other associations who are regularly in contact with refugee youth on the streets try to emphasize that “no one who gives them something should be asking anything in exchange” after seeing reports of men \(but also women\) offering children a warm shower, food, or a new sleeping bag — in exchange for sexual favors or domestic labor\. One barrier to ending this predatory behavior is, unsurprisingly, the shame that such instances of abuse engender, which can prevent many survivors from speaking up about it, even to adults at trusted associations\.
