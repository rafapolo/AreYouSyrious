Whilst the eyes of Europe are on refugees from Ukraine, approximately 90 people from other countries have attempted to cross the border from Belarus to Poland, report [Grupa Granica\.](https://twitter.com/GrupaGranica/status/1505941524470771715?fbclid=IwAR0H26fiSABTP07WrHresqJ1hOiAwQTxpD63BUO0CnMBFRqSy_7CPEcMmWc) This includes a [40 day old baby](https://twitter.com/CzabanPiotr/status/1505967541813927941?fbclid=IwAR0rqLKcCkl_Wqzk9P2HfRKyc2Qhz2HEC6txzXl73r9DeesZDVEJ100yqaA) who was born in Bruzgi camp in Belarus, which is now being closed\. Former residents being ‚Äòpushed‚Äô towards the Polish border\. [This detailed post](https://www.facebook.com/grupagranica/posts/377493924179209) gives context and details:

In\. in Syria, Afghanistan, Yemen or Iraq, it sometimes remains the only way to escape from the threat and the only chance to find shelter\.‚Äù the full post from [Grupa Granica here\.](https://www.facebook.com/grupagranica/posts/377493924179209) 





The conditions at the Poland\-Belarus border are [described in detail by doctor Pauline Bownik](https://www.facebook.com/SalamLabPL/posts/2715527198756415) , who tells of treating patience for hypothermia whilst having to explain why she is unable to call an ambulance\.
#### TURKEY

Often discussed as a ‚Äòfirst safe country‚Äô for those fleeing Syria and Afghanistan in particular, this thread shines a light on the facts of life there\.

The üá™üá∫-üáπüá∑ Statement is based on the idea that üáπüá∑ is a safe third country for nationals of Syria, Afghanistan, Somalia, Pakistan and Bangladesh. 

But are asylum seekers really safe in üáπüá∑?

#### SEA AND SAR

At least [25 people have died](https://twitter.com/SOSMedIntl/status/1505970640217677832?s=20&t=TnRWkbzu_MtXhzvxU35Prw&fbclid=IwAR2pHzwWs43lv3UAOjWUdPyVfITycsSb2DOIdA5JXiRnWxvxI1U-JF9D5FQ) off the coast of Tunisia\. It was reported on Sunday, that a boat carrying around 60 people was shipwrecked between Syria and Tunisia, 35 people remain missing, feared drowned\.

[Two men were rescued](https://twitter.com/salvamentogob/status/1505824392764395523?s=20&t=TnRWkbzu_MtXhzvxU35Prw&fbclid=IwAR04YNZlFXNGxsbiXK6ikL-GpVERY6CDEl6_Jtn9yrP5HZymrGU79gVaIjQ) off the coast of Gran Canaria\. The two north\-Africans were 9 miles from the coast and taken to the port of Arguinegu√≠n on Sunday\.

#### Illegal prison conditions

Prison\-like conditions face people on the move in Lithuania\. As reported in December 2021, the former Prison building ‚ÄòKybartai‚Äô houses some of the 4000 asylum seekers that have entered Lithuania since June 2021\. Of those who entered the EU member country, only around 100 have been granted asylum\. The conditions are illegal\. [This report by journalist Ewa Wo≈Çkanowska\-Ko≈Çodziej](https://www.facebook.com/ewa.wolkanowska/posts/10161747414853574) demonstrates the standards of living that people are experiencing, whilst the people being held in various detention centres have formed a [facebook group to unite and raise their voices\.](https://www.facebook.com/stopdetentionlithuania/) There is also a [fundraising campaign](https://www.gofundme.com/f/stopdetentionlithuania?fbclid=IwAR2ITCU6qQ66ygnpNOCNDRY4vbta40Sc2diMXy9v1Wgp18hK-UgBVPVqxXc) with further details\. The conditions were subject to a visit by the [Council of Europe Anti Torture committee](https://www.coe.int/en/web/cpt/-/council-of-europe-anti-torture-committee-visits-lithuan-2?fbclid=IwAR0dq4Jldnostj_oHBqY41IwI8xnzI7FqRb3cptOUc_znim7kE13mxsOkOc) in December last year\.
#### UKRAINE

The lives of people in a migrant detention centre are at risk\. [The Zhuravychi migrant centre which is housing 45 people](https://twitter.com/LHreports/status/1506029416652156933?fbclid=IwAR0JSr3nKIyx2lFZuGcVz-UA10kWCaIecrlkvtudLwd_g17A8XS5Be-8TQE) from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sudan and India and other countries, is in an area at risk of bombing\. Organisations are [calling for their immediate release\.](https://twitter.com/migradetention/status/1503782279591649281)
#### ROMANIA

Romania has so far received the second highest number of people fleeing Ukraine\. And they are set to receive more people\. [This long read shows how](https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvnb4d/romania-ukraine-war-refugees?fbclid=IwAR2PlY02x6wvCfxcLB7dK06IA4GPyDCQo2JC5UgCeMFNRJ-m59tFmeZtA6U) many people who have left already are in transit to other places where they have connections\. The speculation is that the next wave of people will be less wealthy and want to return to Ukraine once it is safe, meaning that they will stay close to the border, and stay for longer\.
#### GREECE
#### Norwegian photographer arrested in Greece

[A 76 year old ‚Äòforeigner‚Äô](https://www.hcg.gr/el/epikairothta/syllhpsh-allodapoy-gia-kataskopeia-sth-mytilhnh/) was arrested on the 16th March at the port of Mytilene on the charge of espionage\. The individual was later identified as famous Norwegian photographer Knut Bry who was reported to be carrying electronic devices including camera equipment and had photographed the port authority and navy vessels\. Following his arrest, [Bry‚Äôs home was searched and photographs confiscated\.](https://stonisi.gr/post/24498/synelhfthh-ws-kataskopos-diashmos-norvhgos-fwtografos?fbclid=IwAR1QC1BNunFjhHU63A_v6D9sQM4WQcMn4NnLA88AlKiM7oumYS2Q78ApNpg) As well as publishing works about ‚ÄòLuxury Lesvos‚Äô, Bry has also volunteered with humanitarian organisations on the island\. He was given a 24 hours deadline to apologise to the Greek prosecutor\.

On Tuesday 17th March, **200 officers carried out controls in Athens** city centre, resulting in the arrest of 125 individuals\. These strict measures are apparently the result of a crack down by the Greek Minister of Civil Protection concerning ‚Äòillegal immigration‚Äô\. There is speculation that similar controls will occur in other parts of the country, resulting in the Mobile Info Team advising everyone to carry valid identity documents\. Anyone who is detained or would like further information can contact MIF in various languages\. [Full details are here\.](https://www.facebook.com/mobileinfoteam/posts/3284171051811601)

30 people who were rescued from the Evros river island, were **only helped with the intervention of the European Court of Human Rights** \. As reported in the [last Digest](ays-news-digest-18-03-2022-a-final-blow-for-frontex-boss-leggeri-4d6a7f9f2a06) , 30 people from Syria had been left on the rive island at the Greece\-Turkey border for days without assistance\. [A lawyer for NGO HumanRights360 has spoken of the details of the case](https://www.radioevros.gr/h-evgenia-kouniaki-sto-evroskopio/?fbclid=IwAR3VEvDfXIPPGyhYbNIA8nlE2DxHr_nyP_aKKl41zHa6-Yawqnz4fv4QoGc) \.

**Nikolas Sampanis** was killed four months ago by Greek police officers\. [More facts about the case have come to light](https://wearesolomon.com/mag/logodosia/to-perama-den-einai-memonomeno-peristatiko-meros-b/?lang=el&fbclid=IwAR0GW--FsAUSPAEwJyCJOIpGDS9GHxgpqxiQKREcX3pPwGgxt3Z9O42rsrQ) , yet the officers have not been made available for investigation\. [This article](https://wearesolomon.com/mag/logodosia/to-perama-den-einai-memonomeno-peristatiko-meros-b/?lang=el&fbclid=IwAR0GW--FsAUSPAEwJyCJOIpGDS9GHxgpqxiQKREcX3pPwGgxt3Z9O42rsrQ) explains how this is possible\.

Meanwhile, a [2 million Euro project](https://migration.gov.gr/en/xekina-i-nea-toyristiki-kampania-gia-ta-5-nisia-toy-an-aigaioy-ypsoys-2-ek-eyro/) **to bring tourists to five Aegean islands** has been launched\. Islands Chios, Lesvos, Leros, Samos and Kos are the focus of the project aimed at [‚Äúleaving behind the immigration crisis\.‚Äù](https://twitter.com/EleniKonstanto/status/1505594840893079553)
### GERMANY
#### Housing Crisis for Refugees

[Ukrainian refugees are facing a lack of accommodation](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/39327/accommodation-is-main-problem-for-ukrainian-arrivals-in-germany?fbclid=IwAR0Zvk1LVvS5Hn6V41XaCSQhjkSrKWqzbgNYCUWhy7RjsxLVVfiZkAJ7q0w) when arriving in Germany\. NGO Pro Asyl stated that the reception centres which house asylum seekers when they first arrive, are full because the minimum amount of time people spend there is too long\. Asylum seekers stay in these ‚Äòtemporary‚Äô centres for up to 18 months whilst their claim is processed\. Head of Pro Asyl, G√ºnter Burkhardt, states that people should be moved to more permanent accommodation within the first three months of their arrival so that they can ‚Äú [really start their lives](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/39327/accommodation-is-main-problem-for-ukrainian-arrivals-in-germany?fbclid=IwAR0Zvk1LVvS5Hn6V41XaCSQhjkSrKWqzbgNYCUWhy7RjsxLVVfiZkAJ7q0w) ‚Äù\.

**Germany are to [begin processing ‚Äòfrozen‚Äô asylum claims of people](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/39328/germany-to-process-frozen-asylum-claims-of-refugees-from-greece?fbclid=IwAR2UIx0hp1drBUCSvwRwkWM-QGZkmJJkrU15yAZvi06IA2J6HjlwK6gHaKI) who have been granted asylum in Greece** \. The German Office for Migration and Refugees \(BAMF\) plans to start processing more than 40,000 asylum applications of people who travelled irregularly from Greece to Germany\. Under EU law, these people should be returned to Greece but applications had been frozen when a German court ruled that returnees would not have their basic material needs met\.

The decision to restart assessing these claims came after talks about increased aid took place between German interior minister Nancy Faeser and Greek Migration Minister Notis Mitarakis\. It‚Äôs yet to be seen if the proposed aid would result in conditions approved by the German court\.

On Thursday 24th March, there will be a **vote in the German parliament** concerning the deportation centre in Berlin\. [People are invited to join a protest](https://twitter.com/Abschiebez_BER/status/1504927721327058951?fbclid=IwAR0StnvUUt0Q0xrHvSUeh8-aP1loJWkyDENVGLlXzqZVXzIjrupp3Ra_bIk) to demonstrate public opinion about the planned centre at BER Airport\.
#### ITALY

Former Mayor of Riace, Mimmo Lucano, was sentenced to up to 13 years in prison in October 2021\. There is now [a campaign to free the politician](https://twitter.com/ProgIntl/status/1505865520700084225?s=20&t=TnRWkbzu_MtXhzvxU35Prw&fbclid=IwAR2Kcb7O_ZjPdLdBtbHMWpdzagrAgyMr6vdJGeM8IXp-3ZthOUYn3G1avpA) , who used his position as mayor to welcome migrants and asylum seekers whilst also regenerating ageing rural towns\.

#### Homes for Ukraine, but no\-one else

Refugees who fled their countries because of other conflicts have [called for the same treatment as those from Ukraine\.](https://www.channel4.com/news/refugees-fleeing-other-conflicts-ask-for-same-treatment-as-ukrainian-refugees?fbclid=IwAR0R14SRrXUhDLA9oKsV8U9anoG5PcvBJbPbbePVHHgwdjF8n40robXk_jY) This comes as the UK Government opens a housing scheme entitled ‚ÄúHomes for Ukraine‚Äù, with 100,000 British residents signing up on its first day\.

This is compared with the opportunities for those who fled Afghanistan, who remain trapped as no safe or legal routes to claim asylum have been provided\. [The Afghan Resettlement Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/afghan-citizens-resettlement-scheme) , which proposed to allow vulnerable people in Afghanistan to join family members in the UK, has taken more than four months to initialise and proposed to help just 5,000 people in its first year\.

The UN High Commissioner for Refugees has urged people not to forget Afghanistan, where the Taliban take\-over has resulted in widespread food shortages\.

[**Asylum seekers should be able to work while their claim is processed**](https://inews.co.uk/news/refugees-able-to-work-uk-while-claim-asylum-british-public-1454463?fbclid=IwAR0SBaadpKsj6clEPpyZ_UjmDqVLd8HJajwLL-knWk6MvEYUYWq-DOcEQuY) **\.** This is one of many details going to be debated as part of the much disputed Nationality and Border Bill\. Prime Minister [Boris Johnson faces a rebellion among his own MPs,](https://www.ft.com/content/340de155-dac1-4ab5-8e1a-02d7a39479ef?fbclid=IwAR3VEvDfXIPPGyhYbNIA8nlE2DxHr_nyP_aKKl41zHa6-Yawqnz4fv4QoGc) as Conservative ministers support allowing skilled people who arrive to begin working\. This is inline with public opinion, with a reported [81% of those polled in favour](https://inews.co.uk/news/refugees-able-to-work-uk-while-claim-asylum-british-public-1454463?fbclid=IwAR0SBaadpKsj6clEPpyZ_UjmDqVLd8HJajwLL-knWk6MvEYUYWq-DOcEQuY) of allowing people to work\.

This thread details in simple language, the content of the debate\.

#### EU \+ FRONTEX
#### Frontex under fire, again

Head of Frontex, Fabrice Leggeri, is in further trouble as evidence of illegal cover\-ups is revealed\. [Following on from the previous Digest](ays-news-digest-18-03-2022-a-final-blow-for-frontex-boss-leggeri-4d6a7f9f2a06) , which detailed how Leggeri had concealed the illegal pushback methods of Greek and Turkish authorities, [this article](https://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/we-have-a-lot-of-evidence-pressure-growing-on-frontex-chief-from-pushbacks-investigation-a-047934ed-5f94-44c8-8474-df974644f002?fbclid=IwAR0Zvk1LVvS5Hn6V41XaCSQhjkSrKWqzbgNYCUWhy7RjsxLVVfiZkAJ7q0w#ref=rss) details the investigation with proof in the form of photos which demonstrate ‚Äú [Leggeri was in possession of clear evidence for illegal pushbacks early on\.](https://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/we-have-a-lot-of-evidence-pressure-growing-on-frontex-chief-from-pushbacks-investigation-a-047934ed-5f94-44c8-8474-df974644f002?fbclid=IwAR0Zvk1LVvS5Hn6V41XaCSQhjkSrKWqzbgNYCUWhy7RjsxLVVfiZkAJ7q0w#ref=rss) ‚Äù

The first person to sue Frontex after a pushback has [shared his story](https://twitter.com/LexFront/status/1505838175293485056?s=20&t=TnRWkbzu_MtXhzvxU35Prw&fbclid=IwAR1qX10Ga8n-6C2cRqOR8fd018Q4liFynVl49rKa6vw1JilbHVrItZsbmEc) \. Alaa recounts the violence he suffered, with a call for support to continue funding the case\.

[A document has been leaked](https://migration-control.info/mocadem-action-file-niger/) which details the role of Frontex at the Libya\-Niger border\. The document states the role of the EU in border controls which could lead to [‚Äúconstructing Niger as a ‚Äúsafe third country‚Äù‚Äù](https://twitter.com/MigControl/status/1505814029855768576?s=20&t=TnRWkbzu_MtXhzvxU35Prw&fbclid=IwAR2sRZZOsgfq5qGkXlAdQICL-AmWRKX7ejFDhmSyqSzk74dgXAEkbcvnbEc) \.

[Methods and practices for the protection of children need to be in place](https://theconversation.com/family-separations-in-ukraine-highlight-the-importance-of-childrens-rights-179131?fbclid=IwAR0SBaadpKsj6clEPpyZ_UjmDqVLd8HJajwLL-knWk6MvEYUYWq-DOcEQuY) \. This important message comes as army conscription in Ukraine means that most of the refugees are women and children\. Fears that [vulnerable people will be victims of human trafficking](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/39314/ukraine-strasbourg-sounds-alarm-on-trafficking-of-minors?fbclid=IwAR0rqLKcCkl_Wqzk9P2HfRKyc2Qhz2HEC6txzXl73r9DeesZDVEJ100yqaA) have been shared by **The Council of Europe‚Äôs Group of Experts on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings \(GRETA\) \.**


> ‚ÄúUrgent steps must be taken to strengthen coordination at border crossings and reception facilities‚Ä¶The authorities must take steps to prevent fraudulent offers of transportation, accommodation and work, and strengthen safety protocols for unaccompanied children\.‚Äù [GRETA President Helga Gayer](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/39314/ukraine-strasbourg-sounds-alarm-on-trafficking-of-minors?fbclid=IwAR0rqLKcCkl_Wqzk9P2HfRKyc2Qhz2HEC6txzXl73r9DeesZDVEJ100yqaA) \. 





Current systems in place by Western European nations for the protection of unaccompanied minors fall short\. In the UK, minors stay in hotels without adult supervision and [go missing at a rate of one per week](https://theconversation.com/family-separations-in-ukraine-highlight-the-importance-of-childrens-rights-179131?fbclid=IwAR0SBaadpKsj6clEPpyZ_UjmDqVLd8HJajwLL-knWk6MvEYUYWq-DOcEQuY) \.
