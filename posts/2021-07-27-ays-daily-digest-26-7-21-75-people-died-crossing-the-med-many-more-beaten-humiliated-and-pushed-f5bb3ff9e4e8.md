At least 57 people drowned in the latest tragedy in the Central Mediterranean\.
Although we greatly oppose the narative of some people being “vulnerable”, worthier of protection or our attention, the news weighs diferently with some people when it is mentioned that among those who died there were at least 20 women and two children\. Unfortunately, this is where the story ends\.

We cannot tell you their names, background stories, their hopes, life goals, family situation, obstacles they faced trying to live decent lives, what they sacrificed so they could try and escape them, nor how they felt in this dangerous and ultimately fatal situation\.

The only thing evident and known to everyone at this point is tragedy after tragedy\. Tragedies like this one will continue as long as things and policies stay as they are at the moment\.
#### GREECE

People staying in the squalid conditions of the many camps across the Aegean are now under high risk of a heat wave, with temperatures around 40 degrees:

Back in Turkey, where people are pushed back, Afghan asylum seekers are [reportedly](https://equal-rights.org/en/news/press-release-opinion-stc/?fbclid=IwAR3lW9t_UmHGHbZAa3eYnkl8z8ofEnmiGdU7r9W8TvNtqlfA5qDaiSUtjg0) kept as ‘unregistered irregular migrants’ in the migration system or they are treated under the accelerated procedure when their application for international protection is received\. At the same time, there are many allegations of Syrians being forcibly returned to Syria\.


> **Greece declared Turkey to be a “safe third country” for five nationalities without providing any legal reasoning — after legal interventions by HIAS Greece and Equal Rights Beyond Borders, the Greek Asylum Service was obliged to share the “Opinion” which led to the designation of Turkey as a “safe third country”\.

In the meantime, Turkey sends the EU border agency a device with images proving illegal returns of people by the Greek coast guards throughout 2020 in the Aegean Sea, as reported [here](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Felpais.com%2Finternacional%2F2021-07-26%2Fgrecia-un-usb-frontex-y-295-expulsiones-en-caliente.html%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1E2o7kcuGcdkrVljT3iU_oZMSU76tDoxXEOzn0MrMytFm_h2jZHo06mPs&h=AT07ChRyKA3JNNMIUCokGFvSR51GIBIloVhX9dm_N_dS7XjxecXwWMSKvxHnnfzaiWDTIhFg-ZTvWmlxd58H8eGaoDaAh4U2yVlStr6ilDI_AOM96qM19q1qnUDtzA1QbwxQ_40mLr9Utw&__tn__=R]-R&c[0]=AT1y0QmtFmWUwOW4tKbTbgUGC16pEBdNfMWOb_pP4ZFHXkgkAbM6GiaVYdVkjIolOT5HfztKw8qbDDaldzfdBNn954vWsm6rL24tcvJf1kJSQMGvfccUa1T_AMts3oAscYPWyC6JkWLqJC8pwhHBaaHZE9DfAdVkuwX52mNys3Z9gZRC-BUfjaz43Rrh3MmIX9GGXX874F2H8G2zQg) \.

As the government’s pressure towards everyone who supports people on the move or advocates for human rights gets higher, Iasonas Apostopoulos comments on the government revoking his award, saying that “at a time when rescuing refugees has become a criminal offense with grave consequences \(dozens of ships seized and crews prosecuted\) it makes perfect sense for a rescuer to be treated as a political opponent” \(thread\):

The Romanian police is continuing violent pushbacks on a daily basis, our Serbian fellow reporters from Asylum Protection Centre have reported\. They have documented the injuries of many people, the most recent one being a Palestinian young man, Ahmad, who was heavily beaten up with police batons, while the rest of his group were made to strip down and were humiliated and pushed back to Serbia\.

In response to Malta reporting 46 people rescued with little information, “OceanViking searched for a boat reported in distress by Alarm Phone in the Maltese SAR Region all night, with no information shared by maritime authorities\.

Media reports suggest the people were rescued, but the absence of coordination leaves civil rescue assets in the dark\.

In the meantime, many people did not manage to leave the captivity and miserable living conditions any other way, so they tried again by sea and were sent back or arrested:

A boat with 71 people on board that sailed from the Gambia with the intention of reaching the Canary Islands was arrested on the coast of Senegal, the Senegalese Navy confirmed\. The boat was intercepted on Saturday afternoon off the islands of the Sine Saloum delta, located north of Gambia and south of the Petite\-Côte in Senegal, 90 kilometers from the fishing town of Djifer, as EFE published\.

On Sunday, 155 people were prevented from leaving from the Tunisian southern and eastern coasts, being sent back from the sea\.

According to them, these young people are now “excluded from the reception system and therefore deprived of nighttime shelter and exposed to multiple risks of abuse and exploitation”\.


> In the face of 41 clearings that have been carried out with the deployment of law enforcement in recent years at Tiburtina Station, there are zero solutions to ensure protected reception, in a situation made even more difficult by restrictions due to compliance with measures to contain Covid\-19 infections

#### IRELAND
### Making people welcome takes a community

Community Sponsorship was officially launched in Ireland in 2019, and was expected to gear up further in 2020 when the pandemic struck\. Officials from the Irish Refugee Protection Programme will resume their trip to Beirut in Lebanon at the end of September, it is [reported](https://www.rte.ie/news/2021/0725/1237144-irish-communities-preparing-to-host-20-syrian-families/) \.


> Now they realise that this is not just one group, but it’s a group backed by a huge community effort, and I think that’s very heartening…Scratch the surface looking for good will and you’ll find it in abundance 




The Irish Government has committed to resettling 2,900 refugees over the three\-year period from 2020 to 2023\. Community Sponsorship is being used as one way to help meet the goals\. So far this year 19 people, comprising four families, have already arrived and are settling into their new lives in communities in North County Dublin and in County Cork\.
