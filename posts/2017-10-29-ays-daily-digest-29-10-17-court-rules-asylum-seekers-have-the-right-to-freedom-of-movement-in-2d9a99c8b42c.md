### FEATURE

Spanish Superior Court [has ruled in favour](http://www.europapress.es/epsocial/migracion/noticia-tsjm-sentencia-solicitantes-asilo-ceuta-melilla-tienen-derecho-viajar-libremente-peninsula-20171027130703.html) of the asylum seekers in Ceuta, saying they have the right to move around the territory of the Peninsula upon reaching Ceuta\.

This question has previously been decided otherwise by the Spanish police officials and institutions in charge of foreign relations and borders, including the Spanish Commission for Refugees\. The refugee who pushed this case forward intitially received a negative decision from the authorities, either through their official decision or as a result of their administrative silence\.

The usual legislation applicable to these situations as well, checking the documents and people entering the peninsula from Melila and Ceuta will still be an active practice, although they must not restrict people’s right to freedom of movement\.

The previous restriction of movement violated people’s fundamental rights, CEAR said\. Many people had previously decided not to ask for asylum in Ceuta, due to this restrictive practice that made it impossible for all asylum seekers there to move freely\.
### Sea

The UN Refugee agency in their latest [report](http://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/mediterranean) say that **147,217** people entered Europe by sea, while the estimated number of dead or missing people who were on the same route, as of October 27, is **2,806\.**

51 people travelling to Tanger have drowned\. Only two bodies have so far been found, while Morrocan teams are searching for the other victims of the drowning\.
### Greece
#### Growing number of unaccompanied refugee children in urgent need of shelter, care and protection

Only a third of the nearly 3,000 unaccompanied refugee and migrant children currently in Greece are receiving proper shelter and care, [UNICEF warned](https://www.unicef.org/media/media_101396.html) today\. One of the most striking pieces of evidence that the authorities must do something to improve the protection of the youngest is the fact that the reception facilities for unaccompanied children on the islands are now hosting twice as many as they were designed for, compromising the safety and wellbeing of the children\. For those children who have family elsewhere in Europe, UNICEF is urging other European countries to step up family reunification\.

### EC on the Greek situation

[According to](http://www.ekathimerini.com/222769/article/ekathimerini/news/greek-islanders-are-heroes-says-commission-vp) the vice president of the European Commission, their experience “has shown that it’s hard to get the support we provide in the spot where it is needed most\.” This official was one of the main protagonists in the EU\-Turkey deal and now he says that people whose asylum applications have been processed should be returned to Turkey as stipulated in the agreement\. He also said:


> Migrants must stay on the islands, despite the difficulties, because their transfer to the mainland would send a wrong message and create a new wave of arrivals\.

### Bosnia and Herzegovina

The officers working on asylum and other related professions should be provided trainings and LGBTI asylum seekers should be treated with respect and sensitivity and provided information in the course of the asylum procedure, the Human Rights Ombudsman recommended, as the Annual [Report](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fsoc.ba%2Fen%2Fpink-report-2017-annual-report-on-the-state-of-the-human-rights-of-lgbti-people-in-bosnia-and-herzegovina%2F&h=ATM5eLRH5vkWyaSO674DzuQk_zDCPMWHcZ2Mh6JTozDhumEBqvkSYMkr9QfNuhWkcMOhLQkdwCixHta2VTOaCaOftQMv1kMjxn_uHauKz4yWxWrpwX1Y8K0ShDqiiYhzoPaurXp_B6T2IcVI18tDCPVnO3V5VmTQtBNbtkhijScMkPjljLN4Jud8yG7zbfj-hFnwVnao-PlP0isvKZLz0Aun_1iP2h4C0TIBMrzopY_2jpXR14O7xz1yvw_6BP_gpdwwBdQc6moSOourTDk1DW9QiOA) on the State of the Human Rights of LGBTI People in Bosnia and Herzegovina \(BiH\) states\. The problem lies in the fact that until now the adopted amendments to the Law on Asylum of BiH did not encompass sexual orientation and gender identity as possible reasons for persecution and they have not been explicitly recognised as grounds for asylum seeking\.
The procedures need to be established which shall make possible for LGBTI asylum seekers to feel safe to speak about their sexual orientation or gender identity, and to remedy the social isolation and discrimination that LGBTI asylum seekers experience in asylum centres in an appropriate and systemic manner\.
### Hungary

The trial of Ahmed H\. continues tomorrow\. It is going to be the court of first instance again\.

### Sweden
#### Questionable children detention practice

44 children have so far been taken into custody and held in detention before being deported, according to the official police’s statistics\. People that are put in this kind of detention are for various reasons under a suspicion they might disappear before the day of the deportation\.

Great skepticism and a lot of critics followed the practice of such detention practices and the [case of Michail](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dn.se%2Fnyheter%2Fsverige%2F13-arige-michail-ar-inlast-trots-att-han-ar-svart-sjuk%2F&h=ATOd2xNOvVYnK9pvbm0DrdSd6QnE3ru0Uu_xct3jYxV13CUSXjbCxn2yufzwCL2gmgZYgH4kgJoGkFCdc5OrbyoHdUUgp3HGsciWnAREu2YyMJEz-hdb2Y56mWaSucyrcuid7KiRDhPsbEy6JQNuHkcaT-cuJNp3QMY-_gGU-ccKbK3Y5tGKSj5GYxocoGA89ja5RhCQdLF1yFw8SpVOvvuOlsDjpdJtx3L-3bWRFpe4-AkjjGfRwBOayLif-dCBzXGmRMuqgKpKcp9K7b-Daxf7IHs) , a 13 year old boy, represents a strong case for a formal investigation of the procedure for children’s detention in Sweden\.
