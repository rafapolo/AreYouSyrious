#### Feature — timeline of humanitarian tragedy

This March, marks the seventh anniversary of the war in Syria\. Seven years ago, what did you do back then? It’s hard to remember, right? So many years have passed\.

Seven years ago, a lot of people in Syria packed their bags\. Some left to Europe, some are now living in France, Germany, Belgium or Sweden\. Some are still stuck in Greece, Italy or elsewhere along the route\. Some, too many, lost their lives somewhere in Syria or on perilous journeys towards Europe\. Some are stuck in settlements, living below the line for extreme poverty in neighbouring countries\.

[_This is the timeline of the war,_](https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/seven-years-timeline-syria-crisis) _from the start in March 2011\. Some claim, or claimed, that the upbringing of the war was some boys who painted regime critical messages on a wall in the southern city of Dar’aa\. That is, of course, to simplistic\._

But, unrest started in **March 2011** \. There were protests in several locations, just as in so many places following the Arab Spring\. **In May 2011** , Syrian families started to flee their homes\. In Turkey, the first refugee camp opened\.

**In July 2012** , the nowadays well\-known Za’atari camp opened in Jordan, as a cooperation between UNHCR and the Jordanian authorities\. In **December 2012** half a million Syrians had registered themselves as refugees with the UNHCR\.

**March 2013, two years in** , one million Syrians were registered with UNCHR as refugees\. The needs of funding only increased during the year\. **In August the same year, 1 million children** was registered with the UNHCR\.

**In June 2014,** half of the 22 million people population in Syria is estimated to be suffering from the war and in need of immediate aid\. **In October 2014,** there is an increase in Syrians crossing the Mediterranean sea to try and find safety in Europe\.

The number of Syrian refugees registered reaches **4 millions in July 2015\. In August 2015,** around 12 million people are displaced from the war\. An estimated 250 000 lives are lost\. **In September 2015** , Alan Kurdi, the young boy who died trying to reach the Greek islands, was photographed on a beach\. His death is as tragic as the fact that it was needed to wake up the international community\.

**The autumn of 2015** , the so called “refugee crisis” came to Europe\. Sweden and Germany are among the countries that received the most people, all of whom were seeking safety after the war\.

**In January 2016** , a lot of aid was delivered to Syria\. Just months after, **in March 2016** , the borders in Europe are closed\. Europe needed “a break”, it was said\. But what about the people who needed to save their lives? **In July and August the same year** , the battle for Aleppo took place\.

**In January 2017** , the disaster in Syria is huge\. **In March 2017** , the number of people who have left Syria passes five millions\.

**In January 2018** , the Syrian army starts an offensive to “free” Eastern Ghouta\. More than 1,100 people have lost their lives so far\.

**After seven years of war** , [6\.1 million people have escaped](http://www.unhcr.org/5aa1ad2e4.html) their homes inside Syria, and forced 5,6 million others to seek safety in neighbouring countries in the region\. In Syria, 69 percent of the people live in extreme poverty\.

_And here we are today, the 11th of March 2018, it’s not over yet\. Seven years of war, and millions of people are still living in the middle of it\. The neighbouring countries are hosts to more people than they can manage to take care of\. Ghouta is ongoing\. The borders in Europe are closed\._

#### Syria — Ghouta

[According to Syrian state television](https://www.reuters.com/.../syrian-army-splinters-rebel...) , Assads army, backed by its Lebanese ally Hezbollah, has broken through the previously rebel controlled enclave in eastern Ghouta\. Two major towns are now cut off from the area, according to Reuters\. Hezbollah’s military media unit also reported that the city of Douma is surrounded by the army\.

[Photos show heavy bombardments on several locations](https://www.reuters.com/.../syrian-army-splinters-rebel...) , smoke rising towards the sky and if you are close enough, the sound of the blasts could be heard during this not so safe March Sunday\. Since the start of the offensive in Ghouta three weeks ago, 1100 people have been killed, according to the UK\-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights \(SOHR\) \. After Mesraba was taken yesterday, and now soon Mudeira, the major towns in Ghouta, Harasta, and Douma, are cut off from the rest of the area\. In the middle of all of this, there are civilians, captured in between fragmented rebel groups with a million different agendas, and the Syrian government’s forces, backed by Iran, Hezbollah, and Russia to mention some\.

Rebels in Eastern Ghouta, including The Free Syrian Army \(which isn’t one army, but several independent groups and fighters\), have said that they won’t surrender\. With the area split up, different so called rebel groups have different strongholds, Jaish al\-Islam in Douma, Ahrar al\-Sham in Harasta, and Failaq al\-Rahman in the south part of eastern Ghouta\.

The legitimacy and goals of the different groups is another topic: what’s important to remember is that innocent human beings are trapped in between the actors of the war\.

**Chemical weapons in Ghouta**

[US today warned Syria](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20180311-us-warns.../) and the Assad\-government about using chemical weapons in Eastern Ghouta, saying it would be very unwise to do so\. With that said, the US has just as much blood on their hands as any other of the main participants in the Syrian “civil war”\. Assad on the other hand, has hinted about that the rebels in Ghouta have used chemical weapons\. The Syrian authorities strongly denies that they should be responsible\. But, accusations from people on the ground is in clear contradiction to this governmental statement\.
#### Syria — Afrin

[Yesterday marked the 50th day of the Turkish offensive](http://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=86469) , operation Olive Branch, in Afrin\. Since it started the 20th January, the Kurdish autonomy in the region is more under threat than ever\. Reportedly, the people of Afrin have taken shelter in basements and different safe places underground, as the Turkish army and airforce are present and continues to spread fear\. Hundreds of thousands people are living in the northern parts of Afrin city, many of them farmers living on the countryside\. Approximately 12,000 civilians have been forced to flee their homes in northern Afrin and the northern parts of Aleppo’s countryside, according to The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights \(SOHR\) \. SOHR documented 204 deaths since the start of the Turkish intervention in Afrin the 20th of January this year\. Syrian citizens of different backgrounds are among the victims, Kurds, Arabs and Armenians, including 32 children and 26 women\.

#### Italy

[**ITALY — REFUGEE CRISIS DATABASE**](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1834254390190027&ref=br_rs) released [a new report with numbers](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flookaside.fbsbx.com%2Ffile%2FSEA%2520ARRIVALS%2520TO%2520ITALY.pdf%3Ftoken%3DAWwgvJ5Z8PzGV7LSG2dtTRJO--lmclHrGFdWmvSEiM7xObmO5lHMjqaMUjFWw-lEhFl0PWR2wYu6UOSHKPGicIFs-0ypEKkLluRx4kNfZ5w0j0IJ1UwY72Aic82U6Pj4WZ4MjvTiQ2xtSmJ7ykWCSlKju-wX4JtFCSc3RZmGuYvCel1FCvcYTc_O4Z-_5Sw6xihlyBM3AJRFhU1dZq7Zj-MT&h=ATPVFn4Tc7FWQJpgsqRDY1oMZzR1-BEmgZ20_OPewvXtulWaaQcMPkSnEG7XjwHt09vm80q27IE3hU7rEIoGEaM97mXR3r-FtKeIJq3vnaFgUM4gFm1e2xrk) on and information about sea arrivals to Italy in 2018\. Since the first of January until the 9th of March, 5,457 people arrived to Italy\. Compared to the same period last year, that is a decrease with 65,5 percent when 15,843 people came\. Different EU decisions and agreements between Italy and Libya, among other things, have affected this\. It does not mean that less people are in need of protection this year than last year\. The decrease in numbers, only mean that it has gotten harder for people in need of protection to receive it\.

The biggest ports of entry was Messina \(Sicily\), with 1118 arrivals, Pozzallo \(Sicily\), with 1088 arrivals and Catania \(Sicily\), with 925 arrivals\. Besides that, ten other locations saw newly arrived people, with numbers between 50 to 492 people\.

**Ventimiglia update**

[**SolidariTea**](https://www.facebook.com/refugeesolidaritea/?hc_ref=ART70xchFDfkf-jzWWKuF9P5FnN3xSb5VAgqjy8jx1gaE9i3REcfnG3g34GmzMaraeQ) **,** who will leave soon, are still in Ventimiglia\. Here is their latest update, about the harsh circumstances too many young men call their everyday life, under the bridge and close to the border\.

On Sunday, there was a fight\. Some of the people living in Ventimiglia decided that they have had enough of the refugees in the city\. After the Italian election, right wings and populist gained more power\. The inhabitants was probably strengthened by this\.

As a cause of the recent developments in Italy, who are already noticeable on the ground, several of the men have been too frightened to leave the bridge\. The local priest, who is fighting fascism the way he can, has been knocking doors, trying to make people a bit more friendly minded\. We hope this will have an effect soon\.

A group of Spanish volunteers, called [**Balloona Matat**](https://www.facebook.com/BalloonaMatata/?hc_ref=ARR3mKX4QrHDjgKPZ3GpVBdKFP2jAKlGOhOI4aX6MM7FvMKNZHhVN0FQp3zxDDFsdHE&fref=nf) **a,** are collecting clothes and other equipment to refugees living at Chios, in the camp Vial to mention some locations\. Their 9\-seat van, Ballooneta, has been donated by Spanish volunteers for this purpose\. The car has been used on the island since the summer, and to be able to continue doing so they need to register the car in Greece\. This is not done for free, so the team is in need of donations to continue their job, for which the van is needed\.

So far, 1000 euro is donated\. But the total costs exceeds this by far\. Additionally 1500 euros is needed\. Note your contribution with Ballooneta\. Everything donated will be used for this purpose\.

**Also on Chios — donate and help people in need\!**

If you had an easy online way to purchase a pair of sneakers or a kilo of chickpeas for refugees living in a Greek refugee camp and know that your purchase would be delivered directly to them, would you do it?

Essentially an Amazon wishlist equivalent that bypasses shipping costs and is run through a trusted US\-based company, but uniquely for refugees in Chios, Greece\.

Please consider purchasing a pair of sneakers, or a $10 gift card from the wholesaler through which the Chios People’s Kitchen buys food to distribute to refugees on the island\. It’s a direct way to help and to choose exactly what it is that you are donating [HERE\.](https://needslist.co/buoy-fund-inc)

The first time PRGS met him, one and a half years ago, he was already a broken man\. A life on the streets had led to alcohol abuse, and he missed his mother dearly\. Karim needed support, psychosocial support he never got\. He couldn’t go back home to Sudan, and he couldn’t reunite with his family in the UK\.

Deaths as Karim’s should never happen this way\.

#### UK

Ever wondered how the asylum process in UK looks like? [InfoMigrants just did a summary\.](http://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/7991/what-does-the-uk-asylum-process-look-like) The country is about to leave the EU, but is still host for a big number of refugees in Europe\.

The conditions to gain asylum in UK is based on the [1951 Refugee Convention](http://www.unhcr.org/1951-refugee-convention.html) , even though the country just as so many other countries, have forgotten what it was all about after WW2\. Below are some criteria that can make you eligible for asylum in the UK:
- race
- religion
- nationality
- political opinion
- other reasons that puts your life and wellbeing at risk due to social, cultural, political or religious circumstances in your country of origin\. Those can be gender, gender identity or sexual orientation\.



> It is important to get in touch with the authorities as soon as possible after arrival to claim asylum and start the process of hopefully gaining it\. 




The first step is a “screening interview” with the UK Border Agency, where your case is evaluated and heard for the first time\. You will get some questions about if you have been applying for asylum elsewhere in Europe before and then you will get a registration number\. After that, you will be given a person who is responsible for your case\. Then, a substantial and more thorough interview will be done\. Your decision will be given during the process, it is important to stay in touch with the authorities and the worker you are assigned with\. It is possible that you are eligible for financial support and other kind of help during the process\.

If you get a negative answer and want to appeal, you have the right to remain in the country during the time for the appeal\. **It is important to file the appeal within 14 days after the first negative answer\.**
