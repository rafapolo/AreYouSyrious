**Germany — Eritreans under international protection can’t bring their families**

Eritreans make up the biggest group of African refugees in Germany and along with the fact that Germany’s family reunifications have dropped beyond the quota set for the country, now it is this group who has a very particular issue in obtaining the needed documents to get their family members to join them in Germany\. Due to the fact that the German embassy in Eritrea has no visa office, German embassies in Ethiopia, Sudan, and Kenya received 1,645 visa applications from Eritreans for family reunification in the past year\. Due to the variety of document formats that exist to prove a matrimony, the people who fled Eritrea often end up having to ask the country they escaped for documents that would be a reliable way for German embassies abroad to verify the formal and textual accuracy of what they previously stated, as the media [reported](https://www.dw.com/en/eritrean-refugees-in-germany-struggle-to-reunite-with-family/a-53840858?fbclid=IwAR06ldELyWLAP4lvnt8nEHAz2-XmV_cqIL7Xy5onyo9K5uUyqsVfPurMvXo) \. Naturally, the people are reluctant to approach their own consular authorities\.

The country that more than half a million people left has been criticized in the reports as well —


> “Democracy and the rule of law are not guaranteed, the political system is repressive\. There is no free press and the civil society is marginalized\. Human rights are severely restricted,” says a Foreign Office report\. 





Still, many Eritreans encounter a lack of understanding and access to international protection, such as in the case of young Eritreans in Slovenia, that InfoKolpa reported about earlier\.


> Eritreans living abroad fear approaching consular services because of the threat of reprisals against their families at home\. 




**Bosnia and Herzegovina — Misery and threats while dispersion of responsibility continues**

The local team of the Red Cross in Ključ [Crveni Križ Općine Ključ](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100009318317491&__tn__=%2Cd%2AF%2AF-R&eid=ARBlDFzVlPquXqOBJEgA-4LcH0xra0jo2v57WgGVUpXt3nyISSvE_WWe6k9JQeHp8tka-Vu2Utk_ydXu&tn-str=%2AF&hc_location=group_dialog) , working alone and with some side support, has been reporting a surge in arrivals of families and other people to the spot where people have been kicked out from the public transport and left out there for many months now and, in spite of some futile words by the Ombudsman and some reporting, nothing much has changed\.

Across Bosnia and Herzegovina, the situation is heating up\. 
Some new information on the previously agreed set of responsibilities has surged from the recent communication between the Bosnian officials and the European Commission\. It also sheds light on the fact that it is the Bosnian side that apparently didn’t go through with the agreed plan\. This has been hard to read out from the poor media reporting up until now, and from criticism that unfortunately ended with this rather than providing a thorough analysis of the facts of the matter, beyond its results, which can, sadly, easily be seen and photographed in the streets, parks and squats\. Responding to recent critiques sent by the Una\-Sana canton prime minister to the European Commission, to Johann Sattler, chief of the delegation of the EU to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Sattler said that the Commission expects the cantonal authorities to respect the national laws and authority of the institutions responsible, to enable their work and the activities of their international partners\. “That is the only way to ensure the safety of the citizens of the particular canton in the current situation\. If that doesn’t happen, the Commission will re\-examine their support in the field of migration that has so far benefited Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the Una\-Sana canton\.” The functioning of the asylum system has been one of the key issues in the talks of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s accession to the EU\. A year ago they agreed on the plans to achieve these goals\. They cite the earlier conversation about the need for Bosnia and Herzegovina to take responsibility for the reception centres across the country, financed by the EU, and to establish additional locations suitable for reception across the country\. The EC reportedly welcomed the idea of BH identifying the assets in public ownership, and they are ready to continue providing technical and financial support, the EC answer states\. However, they say, they agree with the USC minister that little has been done, but claim this is not the EC’s part\. The prime minister continues with reactions in the media\. It is difficult to discern all the things that went wrong, but easy to see their horrific consequences, from the Lipa camp, to the conditions in the ‘official camps’ across the country, hopelessness among people in local communities trying to do something about the lack of care for the people on the move, and ultimately, the police and official treatment of these people\. We have experienced being taken away by the police and the inspector for foreigners \(even when we were simply visiting the country, being on public ground and doing nothing but taking photos of things around us\) a number of times, but now the police in Bosnia have been selectively treating their own citizens, activists, and others involved in helping\. Latest in the unprofessional and sadistic acts has been in Sarajevo, when the police were picking up refugees in the city for no particular reason, and while filming this, a journalist and activist from Sarajevo, Nidžara Ahmetašević, was documented and threatened with a misdemeanor charge because she was filming the brutal treatment of the people\. Reportedly, she saw police officers on the street who knocked several migrants and refugees down on the sidewalk, and then took them into a police vehicle where there were already several people inside\. Here’s what she said: “I recorded it all on my phone, they arrested people for no reason\. When they put them in the vehicle, the police officers came up to me and verbally attacked me\. They behaved very unprofessionally, threatening me with a misdemeanor charge\. I showed them my journalistic accreditation, but they did not want to accept it as a valid document and asked for my work permit\. In BH, journalists do not need such a permit, my accreditation is my work permit\. Then they carded me and a friend who was with me\. They were very uncomfortable and kept repeating that I would charged with a misdemeanor because I was interfering with their work\. I did not disturb anyone, I was just recording their actions “\.

We support her and all others who keep witnessing and experiencing similar treatment, and condemn all aggression in all forms by the police forces, both in the border areas, and within our countries, and ask for someone to examine Bosnia’s treatment of activist and volunteer organisations, individuals and groups from the country and abroad, as this was unfortunately one in a line of many attempts to silence free speech and the freedom of movement, both of which are universal human rights, something that’s been long ignored in these areas \(including by the international community that is rooted in the notion\) \.

Twenty women and 27 children were on board a vessel, and they had been in the water for more than seven hours at the time when [Watch The Med — Alarmphone](https://www.facebook.com/watchthemed.alarmphone/?__tn__=%2CdkCH-R-R&eid=ARA4N9L1vTl1XRmyQmTm2n9eW8Qj-XteIz7d2w1gg8hIJCTZTVr_A4LKnA6kIpmL-TG2gHLdvvMPZDLO&hc_ref=ARQSd2gBtUcA6DkV3eN_jKiTCRkIjJHgXFbVT_IHecYQCP2Gtw88VyewpCo7VCtcXCk&fref=nf&hc_location=group) reported about them and demanded that a competent official service organize a rescue\. They said a vessel with the number 1411 was nearby\. “Water is entering the boat & some of them are not wearing life\-vests\.”
A bit later, they published this update:


> Turkish authorities confirmed to us that they have picked up the group in distress\. The group’s last position was clearly in Greek waters\! The survivors have also confirmed their return to Turkey\. We condemn these systematic non\-assistance practices by the Greek authorities\.

It has been [reported](https://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2020/06/17/greece-refugees-migrants-centers-ngos-minister/?fbclid=IwAR0rizIKYMa5zCn67Fl58AtS075y_6HTfNlcqmcHZQmiWS0fDq8U6nFBdFo) that **18 out of 40 non\-governmental organizations operating** in migrants and refugees hosting structures have applied to register in the new registry and have been granted the right to continue their work\.

Regarding the [refugees at Victoria Square](https://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2020/06/15/greece-refugees-homeless-athens-victoria-square/) in downtown Athens, the Greek Migration Minister said that the approximately 60 people from the Moria camp on Lesvos “should have applied for the Helios program and tried to find a place to live\. It was their own choice to buy a ticket and go to Victoria Square because someone told them to go there\.” However, as we wrote before, there are a number of issues standing between these people and housing\. So, what he is saying in the media is an obvious deflection, as qualifying for the program is dependent on already having proof of address \(in form of a rental contract, for example\) together with tax and bank details information\. These are not readily available if you have been living in a camp or are in need of support for seeking accommodation in the first place\.

At the same time, local protests in Norway are [calling for the relocation](ays-daily-digest-16-06-20-hundreds-of-people-transferred-to-athens-from-lesvos-with-nowhere-to-go-4a027911d312) of children from Moria to Norway\. It has officially been reported that Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein will provide €7,632,000 to finance new accommodation for 1,000 unaccompanied children and vulnerable asylum seekers in Greece until 2024\. It seems that, unlike in some other EU countries where the ministries of the interior run the whole story, in this case, the initial evaluation and scoring was carried out by a team of independent scorers and the selection process was completed with the participation of all stakeholders involved\.

#### CYPRUS
### Speeding up the ‘unjustified applications’

The government in Cyprus reportedly plans on “shortening the time it takes to review asylum applications and especially to speed up dealing with unqualified applications\.” According to the officials, asylum applicants comprise 3\.8 per cent of the island’s total population of around 900,000\. Now, they intend to introduce the system endorsed elsewhere in the EU, citing a lot of “unfounded applications\.”
#### SERBIA
### Surge of arrivals in cities

The number of refugees in the camps is suddenly dropping after the measures for COVID\-19 have been taken down\. New people have been arriving in large numbers from Macedonia and Kosovo, as APC reports\. The parks in Belgrade have been filling up with new people from Iraq, Syria, Palestine and other countries\. APY continues providing information and delivering food and humanitarian aid\.
#### ITALY

The communes of Besozzo and Comerio have once again joined forces in a reception and integration operation\. They are waiting for their applications to be renewed\. This concerns people whose asylum status has been granted\.
### People from Caritas housing left homeless for 10 days now

With the closure \(announced a few weeks ago\) of the cold emergency spaces, run by Caritas inside Cardinal Ferrari, 90 homeless people were sent back to the streets on 8 June\. This is due to the situation with COVID\-19, which has caused sanitary and technical difficulties for receiving people\. To follow up on this, Don Giusto of the parish of Rebbio has taken care of some of these people but not all of them\. He speaks of the present emergency and also of a centre that should have been created but was not\.

Como will become one of the first Italian cities to use facial recognition, which poses ethical problems, especially for migrants\.
### A political game to close the reception centre?

In Tradate, the mayor has asked the prefecture to close the Melzi shelter\. The centre is currently receiving 34 migrants \(38 a few weeks ago\) \. The main problem is the new quarantine imposed on eight people seeking asylum\. Those who are healthy could go to Milan and would be in single rooms\. There has been an agreement between Milan and the prefectures of Varese\. The subject is controversial and one person denounced the fact that this is a political game being used to close the reception centre\.
### After a year and a half the Salvini security decrees are about to be amended

Several positive changes seem to be on the horizon, including broader protection, abolishing fines for the NGOs involved in search & rescue, and other important matters\.
