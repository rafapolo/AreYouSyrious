#### Explosion in Port of Beirut, Thousands Injured

An explosion in the port of Beirut rocked the Lebanese capital on Tuesday, killing over seventy people and [injuring thousands](https://twitter.com/SVNewsAlerts/status/1290722495071432711?cxt=HHwWjsC15anRyOkjAAAA&fbclid=IwAR0ozbBowszHapEuwiipy9tvrKy4u8FLryBn8sA1eEDv6be4pZlrldZMjXA) \. Officials say the explosion was [caused by a shipment](https://www.dw.com/en/powerful-explosion-rocks-lebanons-capital-beirut-dozens-killed-thousands-injured/a-54437676?fbclid=IwAR17sXRjdNFcf4CFuDAId-VNTUmm-RwC-LIXY_hNAnF7o9UqftGDT2x-Ews) of almost 3,000 tons of ammonium nitrate that’s been sitting in the port since 2013\.

This explosion will have serious consequences for Lebanon beyond the initial deaths and material damage\. Lebanon imports the vast majority of its food through this port, which was seriously damaged in the explosion\. The medical system was already overloaded before the tragedy and hospitals are having difficulty treating the injured\. The country was already facing an ongoing economic crisis and mass protests\.

Are You Syrious would like to highlight how this tragedy will affect people on the move, who make up about [a fifth](https://www.arabnews.com/node/1603236/middle-east) of Lebanon’s population \(For an overview specifically of the situation for Syrian people in the region, [here](https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Regional%20Syrian%20refugee%20crisis%20overview.pdf) is a graphic from the World Food Program\) \. People on the move, from workers in the kafala system to displaced people from Syria and Palestine, were already marginalized in Lebanese society\. They have difficulty finding work, are exploited by bosses, and have [difficulty accessing healthcare](https://syriadirect.org/news/syrian-refugees%E2%80%99-growing-struggle-to-access-healthcare-in-lebanon/?fbclid=IwAR2V-1pDBUCQJkzCYoWjyQ5CiCPFc3jmEmtXFM49zaKHFPpi-R2eqxoqlds) \. The results of this explosion, from untreated injuries to precarious housing and an economic downturn, will likely hit these communities hardest\. Already, two Syrian men [were confirmed](https://twitter.com/Elizrael/status/1290739689402634242) to be among the dead\.

All people in Lebanon need our solidarity and support\! If you are in Lebanon, the Red Cross is asking those who are able to [donate blood](https://twitter.com/RedCrossLebanon/status/1290697993197424640?fbclid=IwAR1sy8wQi9GyXGmL6svG2UW_Pbi-C8SqLyb-eu6rPUiD9VB7noMcWy6bNVs) \. Those outside Lebanon can donate to the Lebanese Red Cross via [their website](http://www.redcross.org.lb/index.aspx?pageid=907) or app\.

SEA
#### Rescue Organizations Condemn Detention of Civilian Rescue Ships

Sea\-Watch, Sea\-Eye, and SOS Mediterranee [published a joint statement](https://sea-watch.org/en/people-drowning-in-the-mediterranean-civilian-rescue-ships-systematically-detained/?fbclid=IwAR02KX3ycvy78jxw4HwTj7SPHlQKUOm1LjnavB6JknLCgmRe-wzlGZEaIdE) condemning the detention of civilian rescue ships across Europe\. The Ocean Viking and Sea\-Watch 3 are [impounded in Sicily,](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/08/migrant-rescue-charities-call-italy-release-impounded-ships-200804135723419.html?fbclid=IwAR1gn2WxpvlfXXtsVW3wA3dwF7Ov04fSCukXAOf3dRPJ-dPcbuC2bplumtQ) while the Alan Kurdi is waiting for repairs and authorization in Spain\. Currently, there are almost no rescue ships patrolling the Mediterranean, even as crossings from Libya increase\.

The ships are detained for allegedly violating safety regulations, but so\-called violations include absurd things like not having a visible sticker on trash bins\. While they are stuck in harbors, thousands of people are still crossing and many drown or are intercepted by the Libyan Coast Guard\. If the EU is not willing to act and puts all the burden of providing humanitarian assistance on civilian organizations, it cannot then block these organizations from doing their work\!

A new rescue ship run by the Protestant church of Germany, [Sea\-Watch 4](https://www.facebook.com/NewsfromtheMed/posts/1003488516771411) , should set sail soon, although the exact date is still unknown\. However, it cannot patrol the whole Mediterranean alone\. All detained NGO ships must be released now\!

A potential pushback is developing off the coast of Malta\. On Tuesday, Sea\-Watch’s Moonbird [spotted](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1290692499753902085?cxt=HHwWioC9oa__uukjAAAA&fbclid=IwAR0BJiZ1aZpKyK0m0Rg1FYYwuNT1XopInvVLyXiRgYp-gj1CdFvT-rNxsqE) a boat in distress with about 27 people on board off the coast of Malta\. The boat was guarded by the merchant vessel Etienne, but the Maltese government did not authorize a rescue\. Meanwhile, the wind [pushed the boat](https://twitter.com/seawatch_intl/status/1290684802509742081?fbclid=IwAR1Q4cdSJR9K9-MxXpr5JtfHABcJtgVApJzW9INiec2CtMVKmAwPrdGsmQk) back into the Libyan SAR, and observers suspect the [authorities plan](https://www.facebook.com/watchthemed.alarmphone/photos/a.1526182797655958/2728853390722220) to leave the boat for the Libyan Coast Guard, even though Libya is not considered a safe third country\.

Even if no force is used, simply ignoring a boat in distress is still considered a violation of international maritime law\.

GREECE
#### German Politician Cancels Moria Visit, Tells Europe to “Wake Up”

Armin Laschet, the chief minister of the German state of North Rhine Westphalia, [visited Kara Tepe on Tuesday](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/26438/leading-german-politician-visits-greek-migrant-camp-and-tells-the-eu-to-wake-up?fbclid=IwAR3rqrVVX4EZWt8tqNm1M0edq3iS6tkZkNY2Varqeq6a-_pYD-DkguPW5bY) \. After speaking to people living and working in the camps, he said the EU must “wake up” and do more to help people in Greek camps\.

Originally, Laschet was supposed to visit Moria, but the visit [was called off](https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/griechenland-armin-laschet-bricht-moria-besuch-aus-sicherheitsgruenden-ab-a-c02d1a33-227a-43f2-abe8-5222dc678d38?fbclid=IwAR17sXRjdNFcf4CFuDAId-VNTUmm-RwC-LIXY_hNAnF7o9UqftGDT2x-Ews) by the police for security concerns\. The source of the “ [security concern](https://greece.greekreporter.com/2020/08/04/greek-migration-minister-stopped-from-entering-moria-camp-on-lesvos-due-to-unrest/?fbclid=IwAR2M8BIj4cLW39DBFXy_GcLR8jk7ngkMiq7cP9mbPN9T3-c1RgNtk__Jv-E) ” was a group of a few dozen residents who had gathered to protest and were chanting “Free Moria\.” People were quick to [point out the irony](https://twitter.com/JosoorNet/status/1290678235156623363?s=09&fbclid=IwAR3ziRZRl7kju9wcXcdPvZdr0c6jEl9NV2onyrkd8cHxys-V0twUABGukcc) — Laschet and his entourage felt unsafe because of a small demonstration, so they cancelled their visit\. What about the people, including young children, that have to live in Moria and deal with non\-stop violence from fellow camp residents and the state? They are not allowed to step out of the camp, let alone move to safer conditions\.

What is not safe enough for a German politician on a short visit is not safe enough for thousands of people to live in permanently\. This should make it even clearer — close Moria now\!

Arrivals to Greece are still low this month, [per the UNHCR fact sheet](https://reliefweb.int/report/greece/unhcr-greece-factsheet-june-2020?fbclid=IwAR3wKWpEI8lY_0m9R3TuJRuCL1zRoQbRzYdKlHDS_OtGqobSrnMZ1O7oWqU) \. For example, Samos reported its [first landing since March](https://twitter.com/teammareliberum/status/1290658212149170177) \. However, this is due to the high volume of illegal pushbacks occuring at sea and even after people have landed, not because people have stopped trying to reach Greece\.


![Weekly Statistics from [Aegean Boat Report](https://www.facebook.com/AegeanBoatReport/photos/a.285312485325196/889118848277887)](assets/3ebc08726eca/0*B8G7EZaixDbOB8Ko)

Weekly Statistics from [Aegean Boat Report](https://www.facebook.com/AegeanBoatReport/photos/a.285312485325196/889118848277887)

Hundreds of [children are imprisoned](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/08/04/ending-child-detention-greece-possible?fbclid=IwAR0tBkpn4I2zb3FhgMnPLwiKrWHuJQxtqK0BSNlKnYlIFfIGovFGv2z1D8I#) in Greece under a system that’s called “protective custody\.” Unaccompanied children are put in police stations and detention centers to “protect” them from the dangers on the street\. However, they often stay there for weeks before they are transferred to a shelter, in dirty conditions where they are at risk of abuse\. Nobody deserves to live in these conditions, especially not children who have not committed any crime\!

[This story](https://solomonmag.com/on-the-move/name-unknown-cause-of-death-drowning/?fbclid=IwAR3DgJKXI79ti4-LTEUNs_JRNTEFTMBTDO6jaHEQBnm1T2mcnAA2HTDAKVA) from Solomon Magazine about the registrar on Lesvos offers an insight into the human cost of the system’s mismanagement\. Afroditi Andrikou has registered countless drownings of unidentified people since 2012, as well as people who’ve died of disease and violence in Moria\. Not only does the interview shed light on the sheer number of deaths that a hostile immigration system causes, it also shows how witnessing the atrocities on the frontlines traumatizes ordinary Greek people as well\. The current system is helping nobody\.

Yezidi people in Serres [held a commemoration](https://epiloges.tv/serres-ekdilosi-mnimis-gia-ta-thymata-tis-gynaikoktonias-amp-tis-genoktonias-ton-gezinti-foto/?utm_source=sharebuttons&utm_medium=facebook&utm_campaign=mashshare&fbclid=IwAR0tBkpn4I2zb3FhgMnPLwiKrWHuJQxtqK0BSNlKnYlIFfIGovFGv2z1D8I) for victims of the ISIS genocide on August 3rd\. In 2014, ISIS attacked the Yezidis of Sinjar, which began its genocidal campaign against the community\. Thousands of people were killed, enslaved, or displaced, and many cannot return to their homes to this day\.

BOSNIA & HERZEGOVINA
#### Increasing Violence Against People on the Move

No Name Kitchen [reported](https://www.facebook.com/NoNameKitchenBelgrade/posts/1040027483062202) about the situation in Velika Kladusa, where about 1,000 people are sleeping rough in the woods\. The people there cannot go into the official camp because it is full, cannot rent their own housing even if they have the money to do so, and cannot cross into the European Union\. No Name Kitchen is trying to provide as much support as they can, but they need help, such as donations of clothing and phones\. The police continue to conduct evictions and confiscate people’s meagre belongings\.

As one volunteer from Velika Kladusa, Zehida Odobašić\-Bihorac, said, the cruelty of these actions is the point\. Stealing people’s possessions, beating them, and torturing them are part of a calculated humiliation to intimidate them and discourage them from seeking asylum\. She also talked about different failures of the system in Bosnia, from the ineffectiveness of multinational organizations to the lack of any kind of legal team\. You can read the full interview with her \(in Bosnian\) [here](http://Zehida Odobašić – Bihorac) \.

In addition to state violence, people on the move in Bosnia face increasing [violence from fellow residents](http://www.federalna.ba/bhs/vijest/328972/video-migrantska-kriza-ne-jenjava?fbclid=IwAR0gRl2END-woMwXQ_VrVsshwHcsN0yFZmofB6zx-wVQFlu8OC88-KDpvKU) in camps\. There are more incidents of theft, fistfights and even attempted murders\. This is expected when people are trapped in camps, with no way to seek asylum or find any other way out\.

LIBYA
#### Returns to Libya


![Maritime update from [IOM Libya](https://twitter.com/IOM_Libya/status/1290616563951968256/photo/1)](assets/3ebc08726eca/0*KiHBwCEvSRgPOdzP)

Maritime update from [IOM Libya](https://twitter.com/IOM_Libya/status/1290616563951968256/photo/1)

Last week alone, 330 people were returned illegally to Libya\. As Jeff Crisp points out [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/JFCrisp/status/1290628355725852677?fbclid=IwAR0E-Um0FCOCQwT4cqADtJe8DAWdv0NJEYF8KzHKdEFEkqifQD18Suev5Uw) , “All made possible by the boats, equipment, training and intelligence provided by the EU\.”

EU cooperation with Libya and intervention in Libyan affairs continues\. The German ship “Hamburg” is [on its way](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/26422/germany-sends-frigate-to-patrol-off-libya-as-part-of-eu-operation-irini?fbclid=IwAR3rqrVVX4EZWt8tqNm1M0edq3iS6tkZkNY2Varqeq6a-_pYD-DkguPW5bY) to Libya to participate in the EU’s operation Irini, to enforce a weapons embargo\. A spokesperson said the ship will rescue any people in distress at sea it comes across, per international law\. However, questions always remain whether international law will be followed and how closely they plan to cooperate with the so\-called Libyan Coast Guard\.

TUNISIA
#### Italy Calls for Agreement with Tunisia to Stop “New Wave”

Italian foreign minister Di Maio said that Italy needs a new agreement with Tunisia to stop arrivals of people on the move to the European country\. He cited the Albanian agreement of the late 1990s as precedent, where Italy was able to “ [stop, seize and sink boats used for crossings](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/26431/italy-s-foreign-minister-di-maio-calls-for-new-accord-on-migrants-with-tunis?fbclid=IwAR0BJiZ1aZpKyK0m0Rg1FYYwuNT1XopInvVLyXiRgYp-gj1CdFvT-rNxsqE) \.”

More and more people have been leaving Tunisia recently, fleeing political repression and economic instability\. Instead of helping them, Europe is planning to welcome them with more violence\.

MALTA
#### Medical Association condemns Prime Minister for Racist Statements

The Medical Association of Malta [condemned](https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/covid-19-spike-pm-unfair-to-blame-migrants-to-cover-his-blunder.809400?fbclid=IwAR1TUBI25Zc8SuxtNLgxdb2jszkDZcz64dY3tT63dgSpVmlATXg1ColKnqc#.Xyjw_TFt0CQ.facebook) Prime Minister Robert Abela for blaming people on the move for Malta’s spike in coronavirus cases in a television interview\.

The doctors said that the statement was inaccurate because people on the move are quarantined upon arrival and the true cause of the spike was the government’s decision to allow parties and mass gatherings against medical advice\. The NGO Republika also condemned the prime minister’s statements, saying they were inciting racial prejudice\.

16 more people on the move [tested positive](https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/16-newly-arrived-migrants-test-positive-for-covid-19.809574?fbclid=IwAR3egK5_ZQMeoE0-bMJcIk6zDdBIjtrsSpe3x5PyANRb2Ra-fsLrpJBPVMs) for coronavirus on Monday, however, they were immediately isolated, per standard procedure\.

ITALY
#### Head of Civil Protection Calls for “Death Squads and Crematoriums”

Giuliano Felluga, the head of Civil Protection of Grado, took to social media to say “we are organizing death squads” and [calling for crematorium](https://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2020/08/04/news/udine_rivolta_dei_migranti_il_responsabile_della_protezione_civile_servono_squadroni_della_morte_e_forni_crematori_-263700732/?ref=search&fbclid=IwAR0Smst1_4u3FyiKq90rXTgXasDXiYjiE2rhrZ7AeZEMUCbTzTGcqC6WOdg) s in response to a revolt by people on the move detained in Udine\.

A group of about 400 people detained in barracks in Udine revolted against quarantine measures imposed by the town’s mayor after authorities placed people that had tested positive for COVID\-19 in the barracks instead of quarantining them in separate facilities\.

Felluga was suspended by the mayor of Grado, but his words speak to a larger problem in Italy\. How many others share his beliefs, including those in positions of authority? Even if they do not share his more extreme views, how many agree with him that Italy should only help its own citizens, not “foreigners”?

Italy is reporting more and more arrivals\. The [quarantine ship](https://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2020/08/04/news/migranti_la_nave_quarantena_arriva_a_lampedusa-263679331/?ref=search&fbclid=IwAR3dSJ--vLyF6IimRd6TXzb46kMmi8-f63Eas3sFhOz9fLB4uHtrzkQkyCo) “GNV Azzurra” docked in the hotspot of Lampedusa, where people disembarked\. There were independent arrivals in Crotone, in Calabria, and Salento, in Apulia, as well\.

Even as Italy’s government is asking for European assistance to help deal with the growing number of arrivals, Germany decided to [restart Dublin](https://www.ilgiornale.it/news/politica/italia-fuori-dallemergenza-berlino-ci-rimanda-i-migranti-1881369.html?fbclid=IwAR3rqrVVX4EZWt8tqNm1M0edq3iS6tkZkNY2Varqeq6a-_pYD-DkguPW5bY) deportations\. The first deportation occurred on Monday\. Restarting Dublin deportations is opposed by the Italian government, who are decrying the lack of European solidarity, by people on the move, and by German activists, who say the practice is inhumane especially as the pandemic is not under control\.

Meanwhile, many people are still [attempting the crossing](https://www.ilgiornale.it/news/cronache/i-migranti-bivaccano-sui-binari-ferrovia-ventimiglia-1881540.html?fbclid=IwAR2M8BIj4cLW39DBFXy_GcLR8jk7ngkMiq7cP9mbPN9T3-c1RgNtk__Jv-E) to France at Ventimiglia\. Because the reception center at Roya park has been closed, many are sleeping rough\.

Like in Greece, coastal communities in Italy are dealing with the recovery of bodies of people that drown in the Mediterranean\. Religious scientist Daniela Stauffacher researched what happens to the bodies of unidentified people in southern Italy\. There is no systematic process of dealing with burials or preserving DNA evidence, and coastal communities often lack resources to do so\. You can read more about this in the full interview with Ms\. Stauffacher [here](https://www.ref.ch/news/manche-graeber-sind-einfach-mit-einer-nummer-versehen/?fbclid=IwAR2gtbTRzbm_pJyYvfI9NqGkm1ev7dzoA2xvCTj_wAGK_LYfQPDC44l3Xbk) \(in German\) \.

SPAIN
#### 6\-year\-old Child Separated From Her Family For Over a Year

Over a year ago, the young girl [arrived in Spain](https://www.apdha.org/apdha-cordoba-nina-migrante-6-anos-separada-familia-por-burocracia-y-prejuicios-institucionalizados/?fbclid=IwAR04F9x_Im8-VPZJrf7MEt-1ybV4EbSF9OYFAH4Mq365mf2-eQJChOToPk0) with her father’s partner\. Her father, who lives in France, requested reunification with his daughter and provided documents that he is the father and is capable of taking care of her\. However, the Spanish authorities requested an additional paternity test before reunification could occur, over a year ago, and still have not gotten the results or reunited the girl with her father\.

This delay has no rationale besides racism — the racist assumption that a Black man cannot take care of his child or is falsifying documents\. It is causing lasting psychological harm to the child, who is living in a detention center instead of with her father\.

FRANCE
#### Medicins Sans Frontieres Condemn Encampment of Minors in Paris

For [over a month](https://www.msf.fr/communiques-presse/campement-de-mineurs-non-accompagnes-a-paris-nous-denoncons-l-incomprehensible-inaction-des-responsables-politiques?fbclid=IwAR0V4587huFUwzVba6vmgicQRJizCxHYcXf6kY0CCIeAmwrtqO6IL8SPvWk) , a group of unaccompanied minors have been camping near Place Republique in Paris\. The government has done nothing to help these children find housing and safety, and Medicins Sans Frontieres is [condemning](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1500856596781774&id=598228360377940) their inaction\.

The mayor’s office of Paris has expressed that they will help but only if the national government helps financially, and the national government has refused any dialogues so far\. Medicins Sans Frontieres heavily criticized this inaction as well as the process of age evaluation that takes a very long time and prevents so many of these children from accessing the help that they need\. They demanded that action be taken immediately to give the minors in the encampment the help that they need as well as every other unaccompanied minor in France\.

BELGIUM
#### Arrival of Unaccompanied Minors from Greece

18 children [arrived in Belgium](http://fedasil.be/en/news/reception-asylum-seekers/reception-18-minors-greece?fbclid=IwAR3q5FFgxiR0hKWDTo5OPlN_ml_IicZ22MqjKWQyY-eah8xJr41nFY9DlPQ) from the camps in Greece, following a promise the Belgian government made in May\. They will be housed in reception centers after their quarantine period is over\. The resettlement is part of a [European\-wide resettlement program](https://www.barrons.com/news/young-migrants-trade-greek-camps-for-belgium-01596566424?refsec=afp-news&fbclid=IwAR2cjlgXVoY5w7VzsJIxFiLZ1JAjQKBYt2OT12561qG1vgCzNAoRVx3hdd4) to help get unaccompanied minors out of the camps on the Aegean\.

GENERAL
#### WHO Survey on Impact of COVID\-19

The World Health Organization and \#ApartTogether are collecting information about the impact of the COVID\-19 pandemic on people on the move\. You can fill out the survey [here](https://www.facebook.com/refugee.info/posts/3233735756686549) \. All answers are anonymous\.
