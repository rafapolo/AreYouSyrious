### FEATURE
#### …but what can we do?

Burn out, burn out, burn out\! We hear those words all the time\. Many of us sit across dinner tables or are at a beer with friends, feeling a bit awry… “Why do you still care so much,” or “I appreciate you care, but it’s really quite depressing, the news is scary and we can’t really do much about it\.” “It’s all organized by the governments\! We have no power\!”

I think I’m not the only one who has felt a bit on the outside — like I’m the one who is making problems simply by bringing up uncomfortable truths\. And what’s the point anyway? It feels like every new day sees a new hope attacked\.

It can and should be disturbing to see the every day efforts of people to help their fellow man choked out, whether through bureaucratic strangulation, direct pressure, or simply expiration of strength, this is where we must be creative\. There is a creeping feeling where we need to be always on the back foot — in response\. This is the time to be creative, and determined\.

Ordinary fishermen in the Mediterranean saw the distress of humans and have taken twelve on board their own boats\. Despite being ordered by European officials to return them to Libya, they refuse\. There may be very dire consequences for them when this is all over \(read more about who is supporting them later\), but this is the sort of strength and fortitude we need to hold on to\. We too often fixate on stories of heroism from history, knowing the ending\. We do not stop to think that from their perspective — they didn’t know if it would work\. They did not assume their stories would be told or that anyone would know\. And how many of these stories of heroism end in failure\. We cannot presume a happy end\. However, resilience and conviction will keep our eyes open to new opportunities\.

One such case of plucky resilience and creativity, documented in the broader mainstream media, is that of a Dutch Protestant Church\. An Armenian family who has been in The Netherlands for nine years is facing deportation to Armenia, having seen their asylum claim rejected\. The family took shelter in the church, fearing that the political activism of the father in Armenia leaves them vulnerable to death threats\. Fortunately for them, Dutch law prohibits church services from being interrupted by official action, so thus begins the longest church service in the country: five weeks long, so far\. The family is using the bought time to appeal to the Dutch populace to intervene on their behalf\. Over 450 ministers have participated in what the New York Times called the “pious filibuster\.” Read the full story at The [New York Times here](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/world/europe/bethel-church-netherlands-deportation.html?smid=fb-nytimes&smtyp=cur&fbclid=IwAR0oSNvMX7fCwnOor8W1DXbImQqWxWl_R13us8FspZsj3kbfsOJ79qhwg3U) \.
### GREECE

Calls to make changes to the deplorable conditions in the Greek camps have fallen largely on deaf ears\. Despite continued warnings about how the dangerously inadequate camp facilities, which are overcrowded and being destroyed by the elements, will result in the loss of human life, much less to say about the loss of dignity and stolen humanity of the thousands of people, camps continue to be overcrowded\. This is criminal negligence\. This video is from Moria on Lesvos from earlier:

According to new reports, after a great storm, the situation on Lesvos is even more catastrophic:

### BOSNIA

Police in the Bihac area continue with the unlawful practice of pushbacks, stopping people on the streets of Bihac and sending them by force to the Kljuc area, towards Sarajevo\. A group of people were stuck on the street for eight days and local people helped them to get to Sarajevo, but new groups of people are being stopped and left by the roadside, often kicked off buses\. Help is coming mostly from locals and some volunteers\. People sleep by the roadside, on the ground, and it is very cold in Bosnia \( \-10\) \.

### SEA

Today Proactiva Open Arms sailed to assist the _Nuestra Madre Loreto_ , a fishing vessel that has taken on 12 people and refused to return them to Libya, thereby being blocked from landing in Europe\. There are many cases of exhaustion and POA declared they will sail alongside the Nuestra Madre Loreto in the event they require emergency medical evacuation\.

POA also notes that UNHCR, the Italian Senate, and other official entities have openly stated that Libya is not a safe place to return people\. Therefore holding fishermen hostage for standing up for human rights is another example of disgusting hypocrisy\. Hundreds were rescued from the Alboran Sea by the Spanish Coast Guard, why attack the goodwill of ordinary civilians?

A total of 103 people were “rescued” by the Moroccan Navy and presumably returned to Morocco\. These people will most likely share the same sad fate of those before\. According to [Association Marocaine des Droits Humains — Section Nador](https://www.facebook.com/AmdhNador/?__tn__=%2CdkCH-R-R&eid=ARDZd-uuJrAeSZ6d2rEdh8Cmzvvu7aEsCfsz4tWxsN6XoAPDTHNdFylzqMIRRvJKValyWXDslpq8F780&hc_ref=ARSHlfiARCOKtbSky63N4Yqu2BrNtTtNQEwAuE95ynXUNcH7pMCepYR9HlHy7VzVsQA&fref=nf&hc_location=group) , nearly 300 people were arrested from refugee houses and taken to a detention centre, facing return to unsafe circumstances\. Another 60 were arrested from another location and taken to be processed for return\.
### ITALY

> What we are looking for: motivated people to work with us, cooking, building, cleaning, etc\.

### AUSTRIA

Austria will be cutting welfare support for immigrants it deems “unwilling” to work in Austria or whose German or English skills are not considered up to par\. Benefits will be cut by nearly one third \(down from 863 Euro to 563 Euro per month\) for these cases\. Anti\-poverty activists state that this will do little besides push the poor into more humiliating circumstances, punishing them for their lack of ability to access education\. The inclusion of these language requirements is an attempt to dodge accusations that this legislation is targeting strictly refugees and asylum\-seekers, but the parties behind the legislation have openly stated that immigrants should not enjoy the same benefits as Austrians\. \( [Source](http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/world/austria-agrees-benefit-cuts-aimed-at-foreigners/article/537844?fbclid=IwAR262h0LgT9bLqUukTapjyDd9si8vuf-F5SNnG-aB2-7W_WuQdHniSNqN9w#ixzz5YFnTu36v) \)
### FRANCE

Solidarity Migrants, Wilson has released a new video documenting a police “evacuation” of the people squatting on Avenue Wilson\.

#### Call for donations

Additionally, Refugee Community Kitchen in Calais is in need of donations and particularly money to spend on RICE\!

They only have the funding to continue their activities for three more weeks, so [help them out](https://mydonate.bt.com/donation/v4/chooseAmount.html?charity=147727&currentMonth=10) \!
### GERMANY

On November 22, a Dublin deportation to Rome from Hamburg was carried out\. The deportation was harrowing and does not appear to be in accordance with procedure\. If the authorities are so concerned about the following of procedure by civilians, why is the same meticulous regard not given to deportations?


> “On the morning of 22 November, after reports from refugees, it came to Italy, probably organized by the federal police, with great brutality, of some 30–40 people to Italy: when they were picked up, officials were violent\. The persons concerned had been moved to Hamburg to the airport where a plane without marking was already ready\. Many of the refugees were tied to hands and feet\. A 20\-year\-old woman from Liberia cried and screamed, so a security guard threw her over his shoulder and carried her onto the plane\. Those who fought back were taken from two to three security\. The guards would have represented themselves as cops, but were not wearing uniforms, but only a vest with the inscription ‘escort\.’ ”

Debating Europe is releasing a helpful series [debunking myths](https://www.debatingeurope.eu/2018/11/29/do-refugees-want-to-integrate/?fbclid=IwAR23aMcjGiur06KHfjUXL5kH1_P4Uwrf_j_3qsCRoNYYNd4C2YseL-uwckM#.XAEBCX4o_PD) about refugees and migrants — this episode is in Belgium\. In addition to an at\-a\-glance infographic, the episode includes valuable statistics and replies from experts highlighting that the vast majority of those who have received asylum or subsidiary protection have a high motivation to integrate, although they face complicated barriers\. Perhaps the reason why some people do not wish to integrate is they do not feel confident about their place in their new home\.
