### Feature

[Two EU diplomats](http://news.trust.org/item/20190326192215-qp90k/) on Tuesday announced that the EU will end Operation Sophia’s maritime patrols in the Mediterranean but will solely rely on air patrols for another six months\. One diplomat said:


> “It is awkward, but this was the only way forward, given Italy’s position, because nobody wanted the Sophia mission completely shut down\.” 





[MSF](https://twitter.com/sallyhayd/status/1110982463764025345) confirmed their disappointment, calling the decision _“irresponsible and reckless\.”_ [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/03/eu-diminished-operation-sophia-abandons-refugees-and-migrants-to-reckless-libyan-coast-guard/) shared the same sentiment and expressed:


> “EU governments will continue to use aerial surveillance to alert the Libyan Coast Guard when refugees and migrants are spotted at sea, so they can be taken back to Libya, despite knowing that people there are arbitrarily detained and exposed to widespread torture, rape, killings, and exploitation\.” 





To learn more in depth about what the future may hold for Operation Sophia, read this [policy brief](https://www.delorsinstitut.de/2015/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/20181214_OperationSophia_Rasche.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2Ym_uP9GlhZcflXsfe0_KrqQW8PVlzUi0GF6OxrhuWeO-Wsv0ApFpEduk) from Jacques Delors Institute Berlin\.
### Libya

[Report](https://twitter.com/sallyhayd/status/1110987454180401152) s have surfaced claiming that a Libyan security guard broke and smashed the toilets and pipes in Zintan, leaving some 100 refugees without access to toilets and drinking water\. Many of these people are already sick due to lack of proper sanitation facilities\. Just another awful example of why Libya is perpetuating cruel and degrading treatment towards their detainees\.
### Sea

[A boat](https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20190327/local/migrants-take-over-merchant-ship-heading-for-malta-or-lampedusa.705731?fbclid=IwAR2dnt3gwaK4I-KJvIaoIyEZDW9JvuYWcK-XS8xc44GRXIGT0FaRK2sb2tQ) was reportedly taken over by 108 people rescued at sea by a merchant ship when they discovered they were heading back to Libya on Wednesday\. Even though the people acted in desperation not to go back to Libya, this is legally a [piracy case](https://twitter.com/emmevilla/status/1110941136754016258) \. They headed to Malta, where most likely they will be [arrested](https://twitter.com/emmevilla/status/1110941136754016258) \. Italy’s Salvini is calling the case a [“kidnapping,”](https://www.ntv.com.tr/dunya/son-dakika-turkiyeden-hareket-gemi-libya-aciklarinda-gocmenler-tarafindan-kacir,n_1GrTDwFUWDlxpyzmFbBQ?fbclid=IwAR0Nb7-BrFS5H_IVFTSe9pwG6YxKjnVVhUpPNBMvpC_6mj4HtAjKQe5OqGA) which is ironic given the news in the Italy section today\.

According to [Aegean Boat Report](https://www.facebook.com/AegeanBoatReport/photos/a.285312485325196/546567712533004/?type=3&theater) , one boat landed on Lesvos Tuesday night with 26 people \(12 children, seven women, and seven men\) and another two landed on Samos \(no breakdown available\) \.

### Italy

The Rome prosecutor’s office is investigating any evidence of whether Salvini is at risk for new “ministerial crimes” in regards to the ship that was held 12 days outside the port of Syracuse\.

Roman prosecutors hypothesize that 47 migrants “gathered at sea on 19 January, were victims and remained off the coast of Sicily until 31 January\.” Seawatch reports that Salvini is at risk for kidnapping\.

### Serbia

According to the sources of Info Park, a Belgrade\-based NGO, a total of 70 individuals were prevented from irregular continuation of travel through Hungary\. As usual, most of them \(60\) were intercepted within Hungarian territory and returned to Serbia accordingly\.
### France

Halle Puget, a small camp for asylum seekers right in the city center of Marseille, has started seeing daily police sweeps for personal belongings\. “Mattresses, sleeping bags and blankets are being dumped every day” so find out more [here](https://marsactu.fr/avec-le-nettoyage-de-la-halle-puget-partent-les-couvertures-des-demandeurs-dasile/?utm_source=Sociallymap&utm_medium=Sociallymap&utm_campaign=Sociallymap&fbclid=IwAR1JTBtW2hjp6NJwowAt8M74PQOLDz-BBTLXQEsot5j7SxfMmvexQaT_MRI) \.
### Sweden

Politicians in the municipality of Skurup, south of Sweden, reported 17 unaccompanied minors to the police for contribution crime\. They claimed that the children were lying about their age, and therefore are guilty of a crime\. However, none of the children \(whose ages were both written up and down from what they stated themselves\) ever received any of the financial contributions directly, which is why the pre\-investigation closed\.

[The latest turn](https://tidningensyre.se/2019/nummer-350/kommunalrad-polisanmals-efter-bidragsbrak/) is that two chief editors \(from Arbetaren and Ordfront\) and a third person have reported the politicians, including the leader of the municipal council in Skurup, Johan Bolinder \(from the party Moderaterna\) to the police for reporting false statements\. This has been ongoing since February when the unaccompanied minors were first reported by the politicians\.

Bolinder yesterday told the newspaper Aftonbladet that ”they shouldn’t have reported” the children in the first place\. He still denies any involvement in the process which led to the decision to file a report about contribution crime\.

The Ombudsman for children has also started an investigation of the politicians\.
### UK

More than half of the deportations from the UK have been called off: 15,200 of 24,674 removal decisions in 2018\. People are raising concerns about the severity of the unequal treatment towards those who had to leave and why\.
