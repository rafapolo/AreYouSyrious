#### Belgium

In Brussels, around 1,500 people participated in a protest against the Belgian government’s migration policy\. The protest targeted police repression, the lack of structural solution, and the lack of shelter for around 500 people living in the streets of Brussels\. In particular, the protest is meant to prevent police from arresting people—around 70 people near the train station and Parc Maximilien—and from bringing them to detention centres on Monday, according to organizers\.

### 73 people by SOS Méditerannée

SOS Méditerannée says 73 people were rescued by the Aquarius from an overloaded boat on Saturday\. They say that “despite indicating their willingness to continue their search and rescue activity”, authorities ordered the rescue boat to return to Italy without delay to deliver the 73 people who’d been rescued\. The Aquarius team was concerned that there would be further perilous departures from the Libyan coast and say they have the capacity to provide assistance to over 500 survivors on board\. The Libyan coast guard says they intercepted more than 330 people off the coast of Libya\.

Meanwhile, the EU continues to train and equip the Libyan coastguard\. A [report](http://www.eunpack.eu/sites/default/files/publications/2018-01-31%20D6.2%20Working%20paper%20on%20implementation%20of%20EU%20crisis%20response%20in%20Libya.pdf) on the EU crisis response in Libya says that “reports about the alleged misconduct of Libyan coastguard officers have raised doubts about the effectiveness of this strategy”, adding that the Libyan coast guards have been “accused of aggressive and abusive behaviour vis\-a\-vis migrants and international NGOs”: “ _The EU is subcontracting to crooks and thieves_ ”\.
#### Greece
### One boat picked up by the Greek coast guard

The Aegean Boat Report says one boat with 20 people was picked up by the Greek coast guard off the coast of northern Lesvos and were transported to Skala Sikamineas\.
#### Macedonia
### Annual report on “irregular migration” by Legis

The Legis “ [annual report on irregular migration](http://www.legis.mk/news/2568/annual-report-on-irregular-migration) ” on the northern border of Macedonia shows that the highest percentage of the population which the LEGIS teams reached in Lipkovo over the period of May 2017 — April 2018 is from Pakistan, 41% \(385 people\), followed by Afghanistan, 26% \(249 people\), Iran 7% \(66 people\) and Algeria 7% \(61 people\) \. Only 4% \(42 people\) of those encountered in Lipkovo were from Syria\.

The most common human rights violation in the area was illegal push\-backs from Serbia\. The team highlights that currently there is a lack of documentation on illegal push\-backs and other human rights violations towards refugees in the country\. They also found that people are being pushed back all the way to Greece by the local authorities\.
### Bosnia

The situation in Bosnia is not getting any better\. The government does not have any kind of respons to growing number of people who are arriving\. Make shift camps are appearing all over Sarajevo, Bihac and Velika Kladusa area\.

Dylan Longman, a volunteer in Sarajevo, wrote a [post](https://www.facebook.com/dylan.longman/posts/10155214936856249) expressing his concern about the situation\.

“Last night was horrible in the park as we found a single woman and a sick child who had walked 4 days with no sleep was stranded at 11pm at night…we took her immediately to our refugee family house…after this we found two families of 22 people again, with many very young children, worn out and with nothing at 12pm… we took them as well and managed to get basics together for them to sleep\. \. now our house is crammed and can no longer help…\. the police agreed with us that something will happen from wednesday onwards… what we are guessing is an early morning eviction…\.”

One of the residents of the make shift camp in Sarajevo city center, where about 250 people lives, filmed this on a rainy day\.
