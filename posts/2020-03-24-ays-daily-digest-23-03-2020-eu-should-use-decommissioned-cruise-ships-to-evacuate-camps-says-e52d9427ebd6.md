Scary, unprecedented times calls for creative solutions\. In a statement a Monday, [Sea\-Watch](https://sea-watch.org/en/send-cruise-ships-to-evacuate/) stated:


> “Due to the Corona pandemic, leading cruise operators have already suspended their cruises until at least April\. The majority of the ships offer sufficient space for several thousand people and have comparatively well\-equipped medical stations\. The ships provide space for measures to prevent infection, for the rapid identification of cases, as well as for the isolation and initial treatment of patients and general quarantine precautions\. 





> Due to their local isolation and mobility, the cruise ships are ideally suited to quickly relieve regions such as Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros or Kos in the short time window that remains, before a catastrophic outbreak of COVID\-19 can no longer be contained\. The local medical infrastructure is already barely sufficient to provide for the local population and will inevitably collapse when faced with an outbreak in the camps\.” 





Johannes Bayer, Chairman of Sea\-Watch notes especially:


> “More than 140 German cities and municipalities have declared their willingness to take part, 40,000 free places are available in the German federal states alone\. With current loans of over 8 billion euros, the German state is one of the leading financiers of cruise ships on the one side, and on the other, Germany was one of the mastermind states behind the devastation of the Greek health system in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007\. Anyone who fails to ensure that people are evacuated now will be complicit in the possible death of hundreds…” 



#### SYRIA

[In an update](https://www.facebook.com/groups/PeopletoPeopleSolidaritySouthernSEEurope/permalink/1320121578185505/) on Assad’s repsonse to COVID\-19:


> “The Assad regime today officially admits that a girl has contracted the Corona virus\. It is worth noting that it is certain that more than 300 people are infected with Syria with the Coronavirus, but the Assad regime is concealing these figures\. The Assad regime, A week ago, closed all schools, universities and government institutions, and called on the Syrians to abide by their homes, even though it confirmed that there was no infection with the Corona virus in Syria\.” 





On Monday [WHO spokesman Hedinn Halldorsson](https://news.yahoo.com/coronavirus-testing-start-within-days-nw-syria-151822044.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANDGjHgHHwhMybNGVZSxo6FqGU4wSrx9Cel0naXD5DKyQ3qRsakmF68X-PkBdiJ1Laq-OSAJzHA4aya0Y2hSAuo_zCW_dNP_0-otBedAMAMzObFthkrGBRBX78Y7U6E8Tu1Wfpi86XO36tbnBsTJRLKcxCZlFPBS5UZmu--Lxs-0) said “Testing will be available in Idlib in two days\.” This is desperately needed, due to many people’s fear of the catastrophic results a COVID\-19 outbreak in the North Western part of the country would bring\.

#### GREECE
### The islands need to be evacuated in order to stop the spread of COVID\-19 in the camps\.

On Monday, [Juan Fernando López Aguilar](https://www.politico.eu/article/senior-mep-juan-fernando-lopez-aguilar-calls-for-eu-action-to-stop-coronavirus-spreading-to-greek-migrant-camps/) \(Spanish Socialist MEP\) wrote in a [letter](https://app.slack.com/client/T087F9KNW/CUDFJAELB/thread/CUDFJAELB-1584973541.229300) to Janez Lenarčič, the European commissioner for crisis management:


> “One of the main issues to be addressed to avoid the quick and wide spread of COVID\-19 on the Greek islands is the urgent preventive evacuation of the overcrowded camps\. Many of those in the camps \(42,000 people in total\) are already in a precarious health situation and, despite the measures taken by the Greek authorities, the overcrowding and the dire living conditions make it difficult to contain COVID\-19…There is no chance of isolation or social distancing, nor is it possible to ensure appropriate hygienic conditions … **There are only six intensive care beds available on the island of Lesvos** … and the necessary health equipment is not at present available on the islands\.”

The children who other EU countries recently agreed to evacuate from Greece and provide safe refuge aren’t going anywhere due to COVID\-19\.

Since the asylum suspension, Human Rights Watch is reporting that Greece denied at least 625 people the right to asylum on Lesvos from March 1st\-18th\. HRW said that _“authorities are detaining 189 new arrivals on the island of Lesbos in unacceptable conditions\. The other 436 were transported to a closed center in Malakassa, north of Athens, in conditions that are as yet unknown\.”_ More [here\.](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/23609/greece-625-denied-right-to-seek-asylum-in-march-hrw?fbclid=IwAR2RFUtSGEii4z0IKqQxPs0zHY97cetdTonevQl5-ba898x5f8dnsstby0E)

Update in from [the Moria Corona Awareness Team](https://www.facebook.com/MoriaCoronaAwarenessTeam/posts/115350160094163?hc_location=ufi) earlier on Monday \(you can find the French, Farsi and Arabic here as well:
“ **_Second confirmed case of coronavirus today in Lesvos\._** _He is a man of about 70 years, a resident of the town of Mytilene, who returned from Thailand, where he had gone on holiday with his wife\.”_


> “The patient is in good health and remains at home under supervision\. But with flu symptoms, his wife, who also traveled to Thailand, is hospitalized at Mytilene Hospital, a sample of which will be sent to Athens for examination today\. 





> Reportedly, the Mytilene couple did not come into contact with people immediately after their arrival on the island\. 





> The rest of the samples of suspicious cases sent to Athens yesterday received negative responses\. Among them is the sample of the first patient from Plomari, who is leaving the Healthy Hospital\.” 





**Later on Monday [a third case](https://stonisi.gr/post/7898/trith-asthenhs-me-koronoio#.XnjYbCjmfCM.facebook) of an elderly Greek woman who had recently traveled to Athens, was reported\.**

In an update on the lockdown taking an effect on Lesvos from [No Border Lesvos Kitchen](https://www.facebook.com/NBKLesvos/photos/a.722860677853724/1686034644869651/?type=1&theater) :


> “ **As of this \(Monday\) morning, 6am, Greece is offically on Lockdown** \. All of the regulations that are either now being enforced or be very soon will be in other nation\-states are implemeted\. For now, being outside without a reason is a reason to receive a fine of E150\. 





> Also in Moria, the measures are intensified\. Going out for shopping is now no longer considered urgent enough to leave the camp\. This means people are completely reliant on the military for nutrition\. Up until now people are not receiving extra food, sanitary products or water\. In the part of the camp that is used for detention the water has been completely cut off\. In addition to this, extra private security was hired to enforce the measures\. Surrounded by uniformed bulldogs, in a place with not enough food, drinking water or safety\. No security, depended on a nation\-state that has made it increasingly clear that they do not want them here\. 





> Meanwhile, a new closed camp has been approved quietly in the midst of this corona crisis\. Without any protest\. Without any consideration\. Without any empathy\. After this crisis is over, the world will be a different place…For us, it is very clear that the future for the people on this Island who are locked inside the tragedy that is Moria, things will get worse…”

- _Current transfer periods are thus interrupted for an initially indefinite period \(Section 80 \(4\) VwGO in conjunction with Article 27 \(4\) Dublin III Regulation\) \. Subsequent transfer deadlines continue\.”_

#### Here is is helpful [COVID\-19 RESOURCE GUIDE BY DISTRIBUTE AID](https://www.facebook.com/groups/AthensVolunteersInformation/permalink/2027102594088694/?hc_location=ufi)

_“Distribute Aid connects grassroots refugee aid groups across Europe through a single online platform\. Their technology allows groups to connect, collaborate, match available supplies to areas of need, and organize aid shipments\. They have been working on a resource guide to help communities and volunteers plan and prepare themselves in this current world crisis that we are faced with\.”_

IRC’s statement about handling COVID\-19 while maintaining protection for refugees:


> “In this crisis situation,EU Member States need to ensure that while they exercise their right to manage external borders and carry out health screenings, their response to COVID\-19 never compromises the protection and health needs of refugees and asylum seekers\. This includes ensuring meaningful access to health facilities and sanitation services, and safeguarding the right to seek asylum\. 





> While travel restrictions may be an unavoidable response in the immediate term to help to curtail the spread of the coronavirus, we urge Member States to ensure these measures are indeed temporary, remaining in place only as long as absolutely justified by public health reasons\.”
