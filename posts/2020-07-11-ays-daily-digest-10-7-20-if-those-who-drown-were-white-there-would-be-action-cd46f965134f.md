### Feature

For today’s feature, we are sharing a report published by search and rescue organisation Mare Liberum on the deadly border in the Aegean Sea\. Mare Liberum writes:


> On June 29th the Turkish Coast Guard picked up a dinghy in distress\. The boat had reached Greek waters before but was stopped there by the Hellenic Coast Guard\. Instead of rescuing the people from the absolutely unseaworthy dinghy as it would have been their duty, the Coast Guard took away their fuel and pushed the 40 people on board back to Turkish waters\. The Turkish Coast Guard managed to rescue 35 survivors, but four have been reported missing\. They found one dead body by now and it is very likely that the other three are dead, too\. Pushbacks by the Hellenic Coast Guard are not new and happen almost on a daily basis\. The loss of life in these operations is alarming, but not surprising\. The Turkish and Hellenic Coast Guard as well as FRONTEX and NATO play their brutal power games on the backs of refugees, who try to cross Europe’s deadly border, and thereby make the crossing to a life and death struggle\. Clearly, in these dynamics the surviving of refugees becomes trivial\. There are many reports about the illegal and inhumane methods used by the authorities: engines are being destroyed or taken away, the tubes of the dinghies are slit open, people in the boats are being abused and have to stay on the water for hours, the Hellenic Coast Guard creates waves to push the boats to Turkish waters or tows them there directly, refugees are being left at sea in so called life rafts — the list is endless\. 





> In some cases, refugees had already reached land on one of the Aegean islands before they were brought back to Turkish waters\. On May 22nd 2020 a boat with 31 people on board arrived on Samos\. The police came to the scene and put everyone in a bus, but instead of bringing them to a camp, they were brought back to the shoreline, put in a tiny dinghy \(like a children’s toy\) and were taken to Turkish waters by the Hellenic Coast Guard\. One of the refugees on board fell in the water during the pushback and drowned\. We talked to two of his friends: The young man was afraid of crossing the Aegean for a long time\. He was scared of the sea\. But when almost all of his friend made it to one of the Greek islands, even though none of them succeeded on first try, he decided to try it after all\. Knowing this, it is even more dramatic that he made it to Samos first and then drowned in the pushback\. He was buried in a forest in Turkey and his family in Congo probably doesn’t know about what happened to him\. The Hellenic Coast Guard is responsible for his death\. 





> According to the Missing Migrants Project by IOM over 20\.000 migrants lost their lives in the Mediterranean sea since 2014 and this is only a fraction of the people who actually try to cross Europe’s deadly border\. Since not every shipwreck is reported on, nobody really knows how many people have died trying to reach Europe\. 





> If those who drown were white, the topic would probably get a lot more attention and there would be memorials, speeches, wreath\-laying ceremonies and most importantly: Political changes\. But since those who drown are black or PoC, they are simply being forgotten\. But black and migrant lives matter and we cannot allow Europe to forget that\!

### Sea

InfoMigrant recently spoke to German NGO Sea\-Watch regarding their recent acquisition of their new aircraft the ‘Seabird’\. The aircraft was acquired in cooperation with the Swiss Humanitarian Pilots Initiative \(HPI\) and will be used for civil air reconnaissance missions off the coast of Libya\. Describing how Sea\-Watch uses their aircrafts during rescue missions, Kai, the NGOs technical coordinator, had this to say:


> From the air, you can cover much greater distances than on a humanitarian ship\. You really get a better overview of the situation, whereas on a ship, you are much more limited\. In June alone, we performed 14 missions and spotted 21 boats with more than 940 migrants in total in distress\. And those are just the boats we spotted\. We must also take into account the hundreds of migrants intercepted by Libya’s coast guard, or those who disappear without even leaving a trace of the shipwreck\. 





> What remains most impressive for me is to see how vast the central Mediterranean is, and how there are just so few ships and so little help for migrants\. We spend six to eight hours flying over the sea in our small planes, and sometimes we can’t find anyone\. But other times we manage to make a real impact\. That’s what pushes us to go back to flying every time\. 





> We have completed about 290 missions since 2017\. We didn’t really keep statistics at the beginning, but we estimate that we’ve spotted about 20,000 people in distress\. 





In the interview, Kai further described what happens when during flying the aircraft they spot a boat in distress:


> When we spot a boat in distress, we inform our ground crew of its position\. They then pass this information on to the authorities, namely the Italian, Maltese and Libyan coast guard MRCCs, \[Maritime Rescue Coordination Center\], so that everyone is informed and can take action\. Our main problem is that they are completely unresponsive\. For example, with Libya, we call nine different numbers to try to alert the rescue services, but each time we come across people who claim not to speak English\. It’s not just the Libyans who are not responsive\. Today we called the MRCC in Malta to inform them of a boat in distress in their waters\. They told us that they refused to communicate with NGOs\. They don’t care\.

In a statement published yesterday, [The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies](https://media.ifrc.org/ifrc/press-release/red-cross-red-crescent-alarmed-increase-migrant-drownings-mediterranean/?fbclid=IwAR1HCWyIFmwWCFelwoWveJfjhqHnIh5B-Zoyg1ipmH19gJlpxJRyY5FOUXU) said that they are alarmed at the increase in migrant drownings in the Mediterranean\. The statement indicates that Red Crescent Societies in both Tunisia and Libya are seeing an increase in drownings on the shores of North Africa and have suggested the warmer weather and recent relaxation of COVID\-19 lockdown measures may be behind the recent increase\. According to the IOM, 20 % more people are estimated to have died in June this year compared to last year\.

IFRC President Francesco Rocca said:


> While Red Cross volunteers in Italy support those who have managed to survive the crossing, unfortunately on the other side of the Mediterranean, both Libyan and Tunisian Red Crescent volunteers are left to collect the bodies of those who didn’t\.
 

> Each person who dies trying to cross that deadly stretch of water is more than just a statistic\. They are someone who was full of hope for a better future, with family and friends who loved them, who likely faced countless hardships along the way only to have their life ended, we cannot forget this\. 




### Estonia

Estonia has granted international protection to 544 people in 23 years\. [Speaking to BNS news service](https://news.err.ee/1111592/estonia-granted-international-protection-to-544-people-in-23-years) , Ruth Annus, head of the Estonian department of citizenship and migration policy said that of the 544 people, 200 had been received as part of the migration programs of the European Union\. So far this year, Estonia has not received any people as part of the resettlement and relocation program\.
### Syria

[The United Nations has reported](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/syria-northeast-people-died-refugee-camps-report?fbclid=IwAR37ggG9yqekVkqjgm02vHJwJ8VHz60F86kUxduuGTyk1_vjA31_3WEXHiI) that more than 700 people in two refugee camps in northeast Syria have recently died from a lack of food and Medicine\. The two camps — al\-Hol and Roj — house more than 70,000 people with 9,000 of these being children\.

Despite not clarifying when the 700 died, or who the source was of the information, at a news conference on Thursday, Mr\. Vladimir Voronkov, the [UN’s Under Secretary\-General for Counter\-Terrorism](https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/leadership) , said that the camps are in “ _very dire condition”_ and states that these recent fatalities included children\.

Some international media outlets have speculated if COVID\-19 may have been in part responsible for the fatalities, but so far, there have not been any reports of coronavirus at the camp\. In April, there were reports of COVID cases in Syria’s northeastern area, sparking concern that it may soon spread through these makeshift camps\.

To prepare for any possible outbreak, the Kurdish Red Crescent set up a specialised hospital, based outside the city of Hasakah, with 120 hospital beds and The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs \(OCHA\) has also built an isolation unit outside the al\-Hol camp, with a capacity for 80 beds\.

### **Greece**

On Thursday, [Greek authorities announced](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/25952/greece-transfers-more-migrants-from-islands-to-mainland?fbclid=IwAR1XmhnMlIsEqhLu5gUCJApbvXcpc4u_g6TJwxHIbU9CgpowaS5mMgFEAtI) that since 1 July they have transferred 784 migrants from the overcrowded camps on the Greek islands to the Greek mainland\. [News agency _dpa_](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/25952/greece-transfers-more-migrants-from-islands-to-mainland?fbclid=IwAR1XmhnMlIsEqhLu5gUCJApbvXcpc4u_g6TJwxHIbU9CgpowaS5mMgFEAtI) stated that in June, the amount of people transferred from the Greek island to the mainland totalled 2,144\. It is reported that in June these transfers took place from the camps of Lesbos, Chios and Samos\.

In a statement made yesterday on reported pushback practices, the Greek National Commission for Human Rights calls on Greece to establish an independent mechanism registering and monitoring reports of informal pushbacks\.

The President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen [has been accused of siding with Greece](https://www.politico.eu/article/von-der-leyen-accused-of-siding-with-greece-on-migrant-shooting-at-turkish-border/?fbclid=IwAR2mO9OirXZBJpGZJXXwloNrHUzTTK7Ot4dU_Mqeo5A2aiWiJZyMhRHiyWs) regarding the shooting of Migrants at the Turkish border\. During the incident in question, one migrant was killed and five others were injured while trying to enter the EU via the Turkey/Greek border\. Since the incident in March, evidence has emerged that indicates the fatal bullet was shot from a Greek firearm\.

Writing in a letter to several MEPs, von der Leyen said the Commission has been in close contact with Greek authorities, who “firmly maintained that no such incident was caused by actions of the Greek forces\.” In the letter, von der Leyen also said that Frontex, the EU’s border agency, “did not receive any serious incident report that would substantiate the allegations in this regard,” while personnel deployed by Frontex had “not witnessed the use of live ammunition by the Greek law enforcement authorities\.”

Following the letter by von der Leyen, MEP Tineke Strik tweeted the following:

### France

[French police have reportedly carried out](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/french-police-move-migrants-calais-163416697.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAMB8zQ2777-aPCGS2S-grZYO8x4IdIKBprnyfSy5FcT4-aCIrQg0UYwv37XWEPMlnIOQIMHFqlgPfkg0f45PuDh49M353hx-3NB4z1jTa1DtF7utgGswdSgY_x4ge2kW3OvsttgaRkHbDtn8iacFccwV31yMEJEUY2bovyngS7h) one of the largest evictions against refugees in Calais since the Calais jungle was closed in October 2016\. Following complaints from local businesses and residents, the homeless and vulnerable migrants and refugees camping in the business park near Dunes were evicted on Friday morning\.

At 5 am Friday, the police surrounded the area and closed down all roads leading out of the location\. 16 busloads of people were soon forcibly removed from the area with all their tents, sleeping bags and any other possessions left being removed and destroyed\.

The authorities report that 519 people were removed from the area and subsequently taken to accommodation centres and shelters across various parts of France\. 13 other people, all unaccompanied minors or families, were taken to special accommodation and 20 other people who were determined to be ‘illegal’ were sent to detention centres\.

While this eviction was triggered by legal action taken by a private landlord, this eviction is symptomatic of the ongoing treatment of migrants and refugees by French police\. In Dunkirk on Thursday, a smaller scale , yet similar, eviction took place with four busloads of people forcibly removed from the area\.

Responding to the evictions, [Care4Calais said:](https://www.facebook.com/care4calais/posts/3425726897460243?hc_location=ufi)


> Evictions are pointless and simply don’t work\. This approach has been followed for ten years, with no perceivable impact\. It was claimed that the demolition of the large Calais jungle in October 2016 would stop people coming to Calais to cross the Channel, but it did not\. 





> These evictions are purely political and appear to be a direct response to Priti Patel’s _\[British Home Secretary\]_ calls for action following recent attempted Channel crossings\. 





> However, the only effect of evictions is to increase the desperation of people living in the camps to escape France and cross the Channel\. This is simply feeding the surge in numbers of crossings we are currently seeing\. 





[Solidarité migrants Wilson](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1481082918759142&id=598228360377940&hc_location=ufi) has reported on another death of a vulnerable migrant in Paris\. They report that on Friday morning a man died in the Saint\-Denis Canal, it speculated that he fell into the canal and didn’t know how to swim, but the official cause of death has yet to be published\.

Solidarité migrants Wilson posted on Facebook to remind people of how despite having ‘fled wars and massacres, crossed thousands of kilometres of hardship, to come and seek asylum and protection in the country of Human Rights\. And finally find \[when\] here \[there is\] nothing but ill\-treatment, unworthy living conditions, violence and death\.
### UK

A recent report from the Chief Inspector of Prisons’ has stated that the UK ‘s Short\-Term Holding Facilities have an “alarming lack of oversight and accountability”\. The UK also operates Short\-Term Holding Facilities abroad in northern France at its juxtaposed controls, which [Refugee Rights Europe](https://www.facebook.com/RefugeeRightsEurope/posts/2338968336409998) have stated have even more limited accountability\.

### Cyprus

[Ekathimerini\.com has reported](https://www.ekathimerini.com/254611/article/ekathimerini/news/turkish-cypriots-urge-probe-over-gunshots-at-migrant-boat?fbclid=IwAR0TTCDl87KnWWdUP5z3TVwZSN2NAHpvK1KYbub0oR69MX2obL-GRAl_y1o) that Turkish Cypriot human rights groups on Friday called for an investigation after police reportedly fired their weapons at a boat that had ferried 30 Syrian refugees to Northern Cyprus\.

In a joint statement, the human rights groups said that an investigation should be carried out to determine if police were justified in shooting at the boat since those on\-board may not have understood their orders\.
### Turkey

Ahead of the 13 July Foreign Affairs Council discussion on EU\-Turkey relations, [Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have published a joint letter](https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/media_2020/07/Letter%20to%20EU%20Ministers%20Human%20Rights%20Watch%20%26%20Amnesty%20International.pdf) to the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrel and the foreign ministers of member states\.

The joint letter highlights the continued clampdown on human rights in Turkey, the recent conviction of human rights activist and the so\-called weaponisation of the judiciary\.

In their joint letter, the human rights organisations claim that Turkey does not [meet the EU’s criteria for a safe third country](https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/06/20/eu-dont-send-syrians-back-turkey) to which an asylum seeker can be returned\. This includes respect for the principle of non\-refoulment\. The principle of non\-refoulment guarantees that no one should be returned to a country where they would face torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and other irreparable harm\. This principle applies to all migrants at all times, irrespective of migration status\.

The letter further reads:


> “Based on research by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, it is likely that in 2019 Turkish authorities arrested and forcibly deported to Syria hundreds of Syrians from its cities, putting Syrians living in Turkey at risk of serious human rights violations\. This practice also potentially exposes those Syrians who are forcibly returned to Turkey from Greece, on the basis of the EU\-Turkey deal of 2016, to the risk of onward refoulement to Syria\. In late May 2020, further cases of forcible deportations to Syria were reported by Amnesty International\.” 





The letter concludes by urging the Turkish government to ensure that the human rights of refugees, asylum seekers and migrants are central to the negotiation and implementation of any formal or informal migration cooperation agreement with Turkey, including by ending returns of asylum seekers crossing from Turkey to the Greek islands under safe third country provisions\.
### EU

On Monday, Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson, and Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement, Olivér Várhelyi, will join the Ministers of Interior of France, Germany, Italy, Malta, and Spain as well as their counterparts from Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia in a conference on countering migrant smuggling\. The Conference is hosted by Italy\.


> [In a public statement, the European Commission stated:](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/mex_20_1331?fbclid=IwAR3a2dgbjj5ZjsNCnPK3qauTS4I2LtOyJCUIF8npUoTN4riKstEK7yC6AR8) _“Reducing human suffering, the exploitation of vulnerable people and the loss of lives at sea remains the moral imperative and a common challenge for both EU Member States and partner countries\. Smuggling networks also pose security threats and fuel instability\. The conference will strengthen mutual engagement in preventing and combating migrant smuggling”\._ 




### Libya

[The UNHCR has published their latest update on Libya](https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/77614.pdf) \. As of 10 July, the UNHCR states that 5,427 refugees and migrants have been registered as intercepted at sea by the Libyan Coast Guard and disembarked in Libya\.

In May 2020, a press briefing delivered by the Spokesperson for the [UN High Commissioner for Human Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=25875&LangID=E) stated that the _“Libyan Coast Guard is continuing to turn vessels back to its shores, and place the intercepted migrants in arbitrary detention facilities where they face horrendous conditions including torture and ill\-treatment, sexual violence, lack of health care and other human rights violations”_ \. In May 2020, the [Council of Europe’s Commissioner for Human Right](https://rm.coe.int/letter-to-robert-abela-prime-minister-of-malta-on-the-human-rights-of-/16809e4c9c) s published a letter sent to the Prime Minister of Malta stated that _‘it has been well documented that Libya, both on account of the ongoing conflict and the serious human rights violations that persons disembarked there face, cannot be considered a place of safety\.’_ In the letter, the Commissioner urges the Maltese authorities to restrain from _“handing over responsibility to the Libyan Coast Guard or related entities where the foreseeable consequence of this would be disembarkation \[of migrants\] in Libya”_ \.

Despite these calls to cease cooperation with the Libyan authorities, both the Maltese and Italian authorities still regularly cooperate and facilitate the so\-called Libyan coast guards entry into their search and rescue zones to intercept migrants and return them to Libya\.
