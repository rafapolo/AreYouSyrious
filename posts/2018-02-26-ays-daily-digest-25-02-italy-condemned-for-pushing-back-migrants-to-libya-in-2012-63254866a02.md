#### **FEATURE**

The German Bundestag has released a detailed overview related to a [research](https://andrej-hunko.de/start/download/dokumente/1109-bundestag-research-services-maritime-rescue-in-the-mediterranean/file) on rights and obligations of vessels under the 1979 SAR \(Search and Rescue\) Convention and the principle of non\-refoulement at sea, with a close look at the past year in the Mediterranean\.

Under the SAR Convention and according to article 98 of the UNCLOS \(UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, 1982\), every ship has the duty to rescue people in distress at sea and, in case 2 or more ships are in proximity of a distress boat, the competent national MRCC \(Maritime National Coordination Centre\) will assign the responsibility to carry on the operation\.

Considering the situation in Libya at the moment and the absence of any national MRCC, “ _their powers to give instructions and to coordinate operations in maritime rescue missions are confined to coastal waters and a strictly limited adjacent area_ ”, meaning Libyan authorities have no power outside territorial waters \(12 nautical miles\) and “ _no right to prevent the participation of other vessels in a maritime rescue_ ”\.

What happens in reality is that LCG and private vessels are confronting each other when carrying on SAR operations, instead of collaborating as designed by the SAR Convention, as it happens many times during 2017\. The vessels of NGOs have the right not to abandon the spot if they think that the LCG’s designation is “ _in conflict with the aim of an effective maritime rescue_ ” and in no way Libyan CG is authorised to use force to prevent assistance\.

The study case is the one of an Italian warship that, in 2012, “ _reportedly blocked the passage of a boat carrying migrants and refugees for several hours without taking its passengers on board_ ” because it was waiting for a Libyan vessel to bring back the refugees to Libya, de facto violating the principle of non\-refoulement \(duty to not push\-back or return people at the border\) and endangering these people’s lives\.

By doing so, Italy violated not only the art\. 33 of the Refugee Convention \(1951\) and other international conventions, but also the art\. 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights \(1950\), sending migrants back to a country where, as we all know, there is a high risk for them to undergo inhuman treatment, torture or be killed\.

In 2012, during the _Hirsi Jamaa and Others v\. Italy_ case, the ECHR ruled that “ _the Member States of the ECHR are bound by the principle of non\-refoulement, regardless of where sovereignty is exercised_ ”, which means that it is valid at sea, as well as on board of vessels showing European flags\.

A different perspective is to be considered in case of omission of help of people at sea or in case of active obstruction of the boat carrying migrants\. In these cases, only if the boat is in distress then the omission of help could be considered violation of the principle of non\-refoulement, but in every case, the obstruction constitute a breach of the principle\.

The research also references other court cases of EU states violating international human rights law\.
