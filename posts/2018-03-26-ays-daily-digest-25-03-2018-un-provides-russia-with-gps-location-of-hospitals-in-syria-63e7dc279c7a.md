### Feature

[The United Nations has come under attack](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/03/24/un-fire-giving-russia-coordinates-syrian-hospitals-high-risk/) for providing the coordinates of hospitals in rebel\-held areas of Syria with Russia and the US\. The UN gave the GPS coordinates of hospital locations in Idlib and Eastern Ghouta as part of a new ‘notification system’ they believed would safeguard hospitals from being attacked\.


> “Syria is one of the worst wars on medical workers in recent history and part of the problem is there has been no functioning notification system to protect them\.” — Mr Egeland — UN Humanitarian Advisor on Syria 




The UN had hoped that sharing the locations would either act as a deterrent, however, a hospital whose location was shared with the UN on March 12 in the region of Arbin, a neighbourhood in Easter Ghouta was bombed by a direct air strike on March 20\.

The Syrian American Medical Society \(SAMS\), which led this new initiative and provided the UN with hospital coordinates is calling for accountability\.

According to Mr\. Egeland, the UN humanitarian adviser on Syria, in return for the UN assuring Russia that hospitals were not being used by any armed groups, Russia would in turn not target any of the medical facilities whose location has been provided\. Despite this, there was no guarantee that Russia would not share the information provided by the UN with the Syrian regime\. The Syrian regime would then be able to carry out their own airstrikes\.

In recent weeks, dozens of hospitals and medical facilities have been systematically targeted in regions of Eastern Ghouta by Russian and Syrian forces — killing many and putting the urgently needed facilities out of service\. As humanitarian facilities are regularly targeted, [MSF reports](http://www.msf.org/en/article/syria-voice-hospital-basement-east-ghouta) that many doctors — following general patterns in the area — are now forced to operate underground\.

With this knowledge as well as the well documented disregard of International law by Syrian and Russian forces, the risk of this strategy backfiring was great, and it appears to have done just that\. It is unclear whether the March 20 airstrike was conducted by Syrian or Russian forces\.


> “They have bombed hospitals with little thought, and have always given the excuse that they were harbouring terrorists, which is untrue\.” — Hamish de Bretton\-Gordon, director of Doctors under Fire and adviser to the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organisations \(UOSSM\) 



#### SyriaSyria

ICRC reports that after 7 years of war in Syria: Hundreds of thousands have been killed or injured\. 6\.1 million people have been internally displaced\. 4 out of 5 are living in poverty\. 13 million people are in need of aid\. 2\.9 million are in hard\-to\-reach besieged area and 1\.75 million children are out of school \.
### Afrin

According to [a Turkish army source](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20180325-turkey-takes-full-control-of-syrias-afrin-military-source/) , Turkey’s military and Syrian rebel allies seized full control of Afrin, and Kurdish YPG have been driven out of all villages\.
### Exodus from Ghouta

Syrians continue to be internally displaced\.

Around 7,000 people have fled from regions of Eastern Ghouta on buses into exile in Idlib — northwestern Syria\. They included fighters along with family members and other civilians who refuse return under Assad’s rule\. People fled from the towns of Zamalka, Ein, Terma, Jobar and Arbin\.

Syrian and Russian air raids on Idlib have increased over the last week, killing dozens of people\.

[This is the largest convoy of people to leave Eastern Ghouta](https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/breaking-over-75-buses-carrying-5000-people-leaves-east-ghouta/) since the agreement was made between the Syrian Arab Army \(SAA\) and Faylaq Al\-Rahman\.

#### Libya

Jeff Crisp \(former Head of Policy Development, UNHCR\) has tweeted that the UN visited 4 detention centres in Libya that were overseen by DCIM \(Department for Combating Irregular Migration\) and reported on ‘overcrowding and appalling hygiene conditions’ as well as detainees being malnourished and having very limited access to medical care\.

He continued saying that according to Amnesty, the EU provides “technical support & assistance to the Department for Combatting Illegal Migration, which runs detention centres where refugees & migrants are arbitrarily & indefinitely held & exposed to serious human rights violations including torture\.”

Despite this, the Italy\-Libya agreement has been praised for its improved handling of migration and ‘the tens of thousands of people saved at sea by the Libyan Coast\.’

### Fascists Attack Refugees

After national army parade in the morning a group of refugees protested against camps and the organisations running them, which resulted in an incident with local far\-right fascists\. Later in the day, a group of fascists with a frontman called Marios \(well — known in the area\) along with several drug dealers and local mafia members attacked the shelter of the refugees with bats and knives\. Due to the hurried departure of the refugees and the quick turnout of police, injuries were minute\. One refugee was injured in the attack, but the injury was only superficial\.

This is not a isolated occurrence, No Borders reports on a number of fascist attacks over the last week in Greece\.

### Refugees abandoned at Marathon beach hotels

It has been reported that [\#UNHCR](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/unhcr?source=feed_text) and [\#ELEKHTIDA](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/elekhtida?source=feed_text) and [\#Syriza](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/syriza?source=feed_text) have been sending refugees suffering from severe sicknesses and who are vulnerable to camps to locations far away from Athens\. This is done under the pretence of giving them permanent homes or hotel rooms in the city\. However, metro tickets to the hospital or city centre are €9 from this location, which is unaffordable for most refugees\. Today refugees gathered Maraton Beach Hotel to protest these transfers\.


> Today after the opposition of some [\#refugees](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/refugees?source=feed_text) in Maraton Beach Hotel to these actions, the [\#IOM](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/iom?source=feed_text) left all the refugees living there alone, which means they are now staying there illegally\.Among these refugees are [\#women](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/women?source=feed_text) and [\#children](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/children?source=feed_text) , and individuals with serious long term health problems, including paralysis — Arash Hampay
