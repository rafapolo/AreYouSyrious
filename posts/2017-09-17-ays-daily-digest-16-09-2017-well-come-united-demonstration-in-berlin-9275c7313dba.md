“ [Welcome United](http://www.welcome-united.org/en/call-to-action/) is the culmination of this campaign in which we are determined \[we have\] the right to be here, the right to school, the right to work, the right to have our families with us\. For us it was a beautiful day that will move us long “, said Newroz Duman, spokeswoman of the initiative\.


> “Anyone who denies us our families, who is drowning us in the Mediterranean and wants to build internment camps in the Libyan desert, who wants to send us to Afghanistan, must count on our resistance\.”

SEA

120 people were rescued at sea by [Proactiva Open Arms](https://mobile.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1643183912379120&id=111995985497928&_rdc=1&_rdr) and [SOS Mediterranee](http://www.sosmediterranee.org) brought 371 people to safety\.

GREECE

Arrivals

Two boats arrived on Lesvos\. One carrying 22 people, the other 45\.

Samos

Another [report](https://web.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10214747074213979&id=1338427042&fref=gc&dti=1652972374920129&hc_location=ufi) has come from Samos about the terrible living conditions people are enduring\. A doctor who has been working there for several months with an NGO is concerned about the lack of sanitation and volume of people living in the small space could lead to an outbreak of dangerous infectious disease as well as about the ongoing dehumanizing treatment\.

[New arrivals are locked up in a cage until they are registered, often they have to spend the entire night in there\. Police violence even towards minors is common\.](https://web.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10214747074213979&id=1338427042&fref=gc&dti=1652972374920129&hc_location=ufi)

They estimate that there are currently 7,000 to 7,500 people trapped on Lesvos\.

BELGIUM

[Community Support for Refugees in Belgium](https://web.facebook.com/groups/communitysupportforrefugeesinbelgium/permalink/1498511166895155/) are looking for people willing to host individuals from the refugee community\. They are based at the Gare du Nord in Brussels\. Send them a message if you can help\.

DENMARK

According to the local [media](http://indianexpress.com/article/world/migrant-stowaways-locked-in-cabins-inside-a-ferry-between-ukraine-and-turkey-4844076/?utm_content=buffer0c234&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer) 12 men have been stuck on a Danish DFDS ferry for the last seven weeks\. The passenger ferry sails from Odessa to Istanbul but neither country wants to take in the men\. Until one allows the migrants to land they will remain in limbo on board the boat\. Several of them have threatened suicide and as a result they are locked in four cabins, not a likely way to improve someone’s mental health\. Meanwhile the officials are arguing amongst themselves\.

UK

Samin, a young man the Home Office is currently trying to deport even though his life has been threatened in Afghanistan, has now had the case against him taken to the Court of Appeal by the Home Office\. A foolish waste of money and a very real threat to a human being’s life\.
