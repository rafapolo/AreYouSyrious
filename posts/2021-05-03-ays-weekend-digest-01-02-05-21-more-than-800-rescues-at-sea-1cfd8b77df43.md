### Greece

Mare Liberum highlights the problem of the food quality in Moria 2\. Even though the catering company receives supposedly five Euros per meal, food poisoning occurs frequently\. The team further refers to a report by [Stonisi](https://www.stonisi.gr/post/16315/paidia-mas-vlepoyn-pente-eyrw-th-mera-gia-na-menoyn-nhstikoi-pics?fbclid=IwAR3YLfM_EaP-bUdBKoUsCUOBPw7gWkgw29TvEuvhApnHtMo5ju6CAyy9wBg) , revealing family connections between the catering company and the Greek government\. “The contract was given without an open call for tender\. The company is also receiving gov funding for fabricated costs for rent and other expenses”, it is quoted\.

Food poisoning occurs frequently: A woman had her stomach pumped 3 times already. Another woman reports that mothers struggle to breast feed, as their bodies don’t produce milk due to malnutrition. 2/3 https://t.co/eAVPzqojyx

The German publication Verdi has documented how journalists are prevented from doing their jobs in camps on the Aegean islands — and how authorities restrict press freedom\. It also announced, that there will be a new Signal group to support exchange among journalists, warn from dangerous situations and help each other\.

### Sea

The bodies of eleven people were washed ashore in Libya on Sunday, after a boat capsized off the coast of Zawya\. Twelve survivors were pulled back by the so\-called Libyan Coast Guard, according to UN spokesperson [Safa Msehli](https://twitter.com/msehlisafa/status/1388883283711348744?fbclid=IwAR1tkHfxoeXJdcrAaf7-Kn3Yt0jI3iMj66wLmXPhIodsDYrIdKCPZ_T1_n0) \.

In another incident, Alarm Phone warned of 95 people in distress in international waters\. Apparently, no one took care of the situation for twelve hours\. “They are panicking and crying on the phone”, Alarm Phone warned in their last update for now\. It is feared that a merchant vessel wanted to [participate](https://twitter.com/seawatchcrew/status/1388947236994826243?fbclid=IwAR1tkHfxoeXJdcrAaf7-Kn3Yt0jI3iMj66wLmXPhIodsDYrIdKCPZ_T1_n0) in a pullback\. On Saturday the team had already lost contact with 125 people in [distress](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1388544142830100483?fbclid=IwAR3HUE7Xi8u1N4CN6FLlsadoSZRVtnBbppcwPeFkejgqm7qAD6haovxanSw) \. A vessel drifting between Italy and Greece [was about](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1388794883998158850?fbclid=IwAR3MSpq-x_Xb2IOJXUMhWB07ZN1GtkguJ-AU_yybskziEZK0w7Q8vPsB4zI) to be rescued and brought to Kalamata\.

While there are many reports of pullbacks to Libya, SOS Mediterranee now raises awareness on rescued people, saying they were forced to go into the boats to depart from Libya\. “Some passengers told rescuers they were beaten by smugglers based in Libya and forced to embark on the unseaworthy dinghies despite high waves”, The Arab Weekly [quotes](https://thearabweekly.com/traffickers-libya-push-hundreds-migrants-sea?fbclid=IwAR1qAKZRiaDpF98d2htxakJK--5JfpdXz4mMNsf9MD2IdQAq-ePVO21nUjc) \.
