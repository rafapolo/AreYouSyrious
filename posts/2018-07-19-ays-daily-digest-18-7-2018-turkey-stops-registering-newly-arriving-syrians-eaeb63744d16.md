### FEATURE

Turkish authorities are only registering a handful of asylum seekers these days, [reports](https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/07/16/turkey-stops-registering-syrian-asylum-seekers) Human Rights Watch\.

“The suspension is leading to unlawful deportations, coerced returns to Syria, and the denial of health care and education\.”

Furthermore, the report draws attention to the fact that if they have no permit, people are refused access to hospitals and schools\. “Some said they returned to Syria so they, or their relatives, could access urgent medical care,” HRW noted, adding that many live in constant fear of deportation due to not being able to register\.

It seems that this is only the next step, as there were previous reports of deportations to Syria as well as violent actions to prevent Syrians from crossing the border, which even led to injuries and deaths\. HRW reminds us: “The European Commission has recently praised [Turkey’s](https://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/turkey) asylum system and plans to release the second batch of €3 billion under its March 2016 migration deal which includes support for refugees in Turkey\.”

AYS has reported about [dire conditions for Syrian refugees](ays-special-from-turkey-abandoned-in-the-fields-654d3f925141) in Turkey before, also drawing attention to the [problems with registration](ays-special-from-turkey-the-kimlik-is-the-issue-20d0f5e7efa1) \. Nevertheless, despite all the claims, proofs and appeals, the EU is still determined to keep the EU — Turkey deal alive, and draw up new ones with countries where human rights are marginalised\.
### SEA

SOS Mediterranee announced that it will have to reevaluate its operations, as safe ports at a “reasonable distance” are not accessible to them and other NGOs anymore from the search and rescue zone\.

Mission Lifeline’s captain Reisch [accused](https://twitter.com/SEENOTRETTUNG/status/1019481914338668544) the so\-called Lybian Coast Guard of murder, after it destroyed a vessel with two women and one child on board\. The child and one women died, the rescue NGO says\. “The EU financed this crime\.” Meanwhile, Spain had allowed Open Arms to disembark them at the port of Palma\.

Alarmphone [raises awareness](https://alarmphone.org/en/2018/07/18/press-release-migrants-rescued-in-distress-in-maltese-search-and-rescue-zone-illegally-transferred-to-tunisian-territorial-waters/?post_type_release_type=post) of an alleged pull\-back to Tunisian waters\. They had “collected information that strongly suggest that a boat carrying 40 migrants from several African countries seeking protection in Europe was illegally transferred into Tunisian territorial waters after having already reached international waters and the Maltese Search and Rescue \(SAR\) zone\.” The boat left from Libya and was rescued in Maltese waters\. After they were transferred to the Astrat oil platform, because Italy and Malta refused to allow the rescue ship to disembark them there\. Later, the supply vessel was also blocked by the authorities at Sfax and Zarzis, Tunisia\. And apparently since this Monday they have been waiting for a safe port to open\.

Forty\-one people were rescued off Spain this morning from four boats, [reports](https://twitter.com/salvamentogob/status/1019513869495144448) Salvamento Maritimo\. By afternoon, another 72 people had been rescued from seven boats\.
### GREECE
#### Sinking boat intercepted between Cyprus and Turkish coast

A boat was found sinking between Cyprus and the Turkish coast today, [reports](http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/dunya/son-dakika-kibris-aciklarinda-facia-cok-sayida-olu-ve-yarali-var-40900999) Hurriyet\. The boat carried approximately 150 people, no exact number is available at the moment\. So far, 19 are confirmed to have died, 103 were saved, approximately 30 are still missing\. The survivors have been brought to Turkey\.

#### Pakistani worker murdered

The police in Arta are investigating the death of a Pakistani who is assumed to have been murdered while working in a field on Monday\. The body of the 32\-year old man is reported to have been badly mutilated, according to [Ekathimerini](http://www.ekathimerini.com/230772/article/ekathimerini/news/migrant-worker-found-murdered-mutilated-in-northwestern-greece) \. The investigations indicated that he was stabbed to death, before he was attacked with a hatchet\-like tool\.

### HUNGARY
#### HRW slams Hungarian government in recent report

In a new [report](https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/07/17/hungary-determined-silence-any-critics-left-standing) , Human Rights Watch slams the Hungarian government for its restrictive and intimidating policy against human rights groups working with vulnerable groups such as people on the run, migrants, Roma or homeless\. As examples of this, HRW spoke of a draft bill to set up a 25 percent tax on funds to be used for “supporters of migration” or the risk for volunteers who would face up to one year in prison under another law\. The NGO concludes:


> These are serious risks affecting everyone’s rights to free assembly and expression\. The changes benefit a political elite irritated by the voices demanding the government to heed European values of democracy, transparency and rule of law\. 




### AUSTRIA
#### Deportation flight rumours

Activists [warn](https://www.facebook.com/plattform.refugees.welcome/photos/pcb.2042257499370666/2042256749370741/?type=3&theater) that there are rumours of another deportation flight from Austria to Afghanistan on July 30th\.
### FRANCE
#### Organizations demand government withdrawal from bill amendment

Several organizations in France are [demanding](https://www.gisti.org/spip.php?article5953) the government withdraw from the amendment of the Asylum and Immigration Bill, placing unaccompanied minors at a disadvantage\. It includes implementing a database of the minors with fingerprints and photographs\. However, French law provides that they must be considered minors until a decision is made on their age\. The NGOs say that this database foments suspicion of isolated minors\.
#### Distribution in Ouistraham

Volunteers of Care4Calais have visited the port town of Ouistraham close to Caen recently\. Thanks to the Packs4Calais campaign, they were able to distribute almost 200 packs of clothes, underwear, hygiene products and toiletries alongside with local supporters: “The refugees there have nothing\. There are no associations to help them and most come from third world counties and are very poor\. We were glad we saved the packs up for this trip now that donations are so low in the warehouse\.” Additionally, they visited one of the six squats in the region with around 200 residents\. “Young children played in the yard or participated in activities organized by local schoolteachers,” they said\.

#### Updated guide for asylum seekers in Paris

Volunteers in France have [published](https://guideasile.wordpress.com/) an updated guide for asylum seekers in Paris\. The file is already available in French, English, and Arabic, and more languages are to follow\.

#### Call for donated cell phones

Phone Credit for Refugees and Displaced People is asking for donated cell phones to distribute in France with their partners\. For this, they published a small guideline, how best to donate\.

#### Four activists taken into custody

Four activists in France have been taken into custody for allegedly helping foreigners to cross the border illegally during a solidarity March on April 22nd, Le Monde [reports](https://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2018/07/17/quatre-militants-associatifs-en-garde-a-vue-pour-aide-a-l-entree-d-etrangers_5332656_3224.html) \.
### NETHERLANDS
#### Shelter efforts in Amsterdam continue to face difficulties

It remains unclear if a 24\-hour reception centre for asylum seekers and undocumented people will be opened this year in Amsterdam, [reports](http://www.at5.nl/artikelen/184440/24-uursopvang-opent-waarschijnlijk-pas-volgend-jaar) AT5\. At the same time, the temporary shelter at Havenstraat will close in September\. No alternative has yet been found\. The 24\-hour shelter was part of the coalition centre and aimed to accommodate up to 500 people\.
### SWEDEN
#### Migration Agency makes decision on invocation of “high school law”

The Migration Agency today [said](https://www.migrationsverket.se/Om-Migrationsverket/Nyhetsarkiv/Nyhetsarkiv-2018/2018-07-18-Migrationsverket-avvaktar-med-bifallsbeslut-som-galler-den-nya-gymnasielagen.html) that they will wait to give positive answers in cases where the new high school law has been invoked\. Applications, wherever it is obvious that the applicant has not met the basic demands, will continue to be rejected\. The decision came after a couple of weeks where different migration courts, mainly the one in Malmö, and subsequently in Stockholm, have refused to apply the new law, claiming that it is insufficient but for different reasons\. For now, the law will not be applied before it has been overseen and juridical guidance is available from the High Migration Court \(Migrationsöverdomstolen\) \.

As a reminder, the new and extended high school law includes an estimated 9,000 young people more than the old law\. The new legislation has lowered the criteria for identification of the applicant, meant to make it easier for people to get permission to stay to fulfill their high\-school studies\.

Anyhow, rejections will continue in cases where the applicant does not meet the basic criteria\. This could, for instance, be for people who came after November 24th, 2015 or have not waited for more than 15 months for a decision\. Since the new law took effect on July 1st of this year, 4,000 applications have been filed\. Less than 100 have been processed and, of those, only 10 were approved\.
#### Situation remains unclear in prevented deportation

As reported in [yesterday’s digest](ays-daily-digest-17-7-2018-the-situation-in-bosnia-from-bad-to-worse-ac9ec889a649) , the situation of the prevented deportation of a homosexual and a protection seeker who had Christianity converted in Sweden remains uncertain\.

According to [Aftonbladet](https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/kaO4ok/flygpassagerarna-stallde-sig-upp-i-protest--utvisning-stoppades) , activists who spontaniously booked tickets for the same flight, managed to draw attention on the ongoing deportation, so the pilot refused to transport 19\-year old Mohammad\. However, the police still highlight that the deportation decision is valid\. It seems possible, therefore, that Swedish authorities will try to deport him again\.
