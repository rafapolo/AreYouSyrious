#### Syria
### Ceasefire has not stopped the violence\.


> _“_ OUT of control _” is how John Kerry, America’s secretary of state, described Syria’s war this week\. “_ A miracle that is now fragile _,” said Staffan de Mistura, the UN envoy to Syria, on the partial ceasefire that had brought a degree of calm since it came into force on February 27th\._ 





> _Violence in Syria is rapidly escalating\. Since April 21st President Bashar al\-Assad’s regime has been blasting Aleppo, the country’s biggest city\. On April 27th the regime bombed al\-Quds hospital, killing more than 55 people\. In February Médecins sans Frontières, a medical charity, stopped giving the co\-ordinates of hospitals it supports to the Syrian and Russian governments\. It worries that pro\-Assad jets are deliberately targeting them\. The rebels are not blameless\. They have intensified their shelling of the government\-held part of the city, making life more dangerous for civilians there\. On May 3rd a mortar shell fired by rebels killed three people in a hospital\. The rebels said they were aiming at a tank nearby\._ 





> _The rate at which people are dying from the fighting is climbing back to where it was before the ceasefire\. In the past fortnight alone, strikes on Aleppo by Mr\. Assad’s regime have resulted in at least 200 deaths\. If the truce is ineffective, it is unlikely that peace talks in Geneva will reconvene \(they ended in acrimony last month\. \)_

#### Turkey
### Istanbul clinic at Bezmialem University Hospital’s Fatih branch employs Syrian staff for night shifts through Doctors World Wide\.


> _A [hospital](http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/istanbul-clinic-employs-syrian-staff-for-night-shifts-.aspx?pageID=238&nID=98973&NewsCatID=373) in Istanbul has been employing Syrian doctors to work evening shifts in order to meet the health needs of mostly Arabic\-speaking Syrian patients, who have limited alternatives for medical treatment in Turkey due to language barriers\._ 





> _A total of seven Syrian doctors and three Syrian nurses, who are members of the non\-governmental organization Doctors Worldwide, have been working evening shifts starting at 5:30 p\.m\. at Bezmialem University Hospital’s Fatih branch to offer health services to mostly Arabic\-speaking Syrian patients, who face difficulties in regular hospitals as they cannot speak Turkish\._ 





> _The staff, which receives 300 patients per day, consists of Syrian doctors and nurses who fled their country in the face of the five\-year\-long civil war which caused a major worldwide refugee crisis\._ 




### Turkey using “anti\-terror” laws as an excuse to limit people’s freedoms\. EU is fine with that\.


> _The European Union says it is moving ahead with plans to allow Turkish citizens to travel to Europe without visas despite President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s stated refusal to change Turkey’s anti\-terror laws\._ 





> _The EU says Turkey must narrow its definition of “terrorist” and “terrorist act” to secure a visa waiver\. The EU is concerned that journalists and political dissenters are targeted\. Namely, Turkey’s broad definition of terrorism means that any journalist reporting on PKK activities or Kurdish rights can be [charged with the offence of making “terrorist propaganda”](https://www.opendemocracy.net/anna-bragga/turkey-media-crisis-how-anti-terrorism-laws-equip-war-on-dissent) and jailed\. This also applies to anyone critiquing the State, as it has already become famous with the president Erdogan arresting creators of memes and jokes against him\._ 





> _European Commission spokesman Alexander Winterstein said Tuesday that “_ we have the word of the Turkish government and we will continue working with the Turkish government _\.”_ 





> _The Commission has not received official word from Ankara that visa talks have ended\._ 





> _The waiver is an incentive — along with up to 6 billion euros \($6\.8 billion\) and fast\-track EU membership talks — for Turkey to stop migrants leaving for Europe\._

> _The group also urged Turkey to reopen its border to Syrians\._ 





> _Turkey, home to 2\.7 million Syrian refugees, rejects claims that its border guards shoot at refugees and says it has an open\-door policy toward migrants, although new arrivals are rare\._ 





> _Human Rights Watch researcher Gerry Simpson said: “_ Firing at traumatized men, women, and children fleeing fighting and indiscriminate warfare is truly appalling _\.”_

> _Following yesterday’s report that food wasn’t allowed into the camp, we have heard that controls are becoming tighter\. Food distribution crews now have to present receipts for their food purchases before being allowed to distribute it\. As a result of controls distribution has become less regular, though it still continues\._ 





> _The authorities say they are trying to control black market sale of foods and other products in the camp, but there is speculation that this is being done to make conditions poorer so that people will leave Idomeni\._

> _The camp is home to about 10,000 people thwarted from reaching Europe’s prosperous heartland by a series of Balkan border closures this year\._ 





> _Greek authorities have been trying for months, with little success, to persuade migrants at Idomeni to move to other organized camps, but refugees are, unsurprisingly, anxiously waiting for Macedonian border to open\._ 




### Yazidis stranded due to closed borders\.

> _The refugees who tried swimming to Turkey were spotted by volunteers from Drops in the Ocean, a Norwegian charity, who called the Hellenic Coast Guard\. Two speedboats picked up the four swimmers, who were equipped with life\-vests, and brought them to shore\. They had barely gotten out of the harbor in the half\-hour they were in the ocean, but that did not seem to deter some of the people watching\. “_ Tomorrow we will also try _,” they said as the boats disappeared from sight\._ 




#### Hungary
### Hungary approves of more restricted conditions for asylum seekers\.


> _Hungary’s parliament has approved tougher conditions for asylum seekers, including cutting allowed stays at reception centers from 60 days to 30 days and gradually reducing their social benefits and subsidies\._

#### Poland
### Polish Law and Justice Party continues to refuse acceptance of asylum seekers or alternative\.s


> _Poland has accepted less asylum\-seekers per capita than almost any other European nation\. Jaroslaw Kaczynski is the leader of Poland’s ruling Law and Justice \(PiS\) party\. PiS takes a nationalist, right\-wing stance on most issues, vocally opposing [EU](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe) plans to house and feed refugees fleeing the Syrian civil war and other humanitarian crises\._ 





> _In a [political broadcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlwmaTLlLj4) published on YouTube, he said: “After recent events connected with acts of terror, \[Poland\] will not accept refugees because there is no mechanism that would ensure security\.”_ 





> _The European Union has [recently suggested](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/countries-refusing-to-accept-refugees-could-be-fined-hundreds-of-millions-of-pounds-a7012761.html) that countries should be asked to accept a quota of refugees, or pay €250,000 \(£200,000\) for each asylum\-seeker they turn away\._ 





> _The money raised would be given to countries such as Greece, Germany and Italy who are currently housing a disproportionately high number of refugees\._ 





> _But Mr Kaczynski also spoke out in opposition to these plans, which would see Poland asked to meet a quota of 6500 refugees or provide over €1\.6bn \(£1\.25bn\) in support for the humanitarian effort\._ 





> _“Such a decision would abolish the sovereignty of EU member states — of course, the weaker ones,” he said\. “We don’t agree to that, we have to oppose that, because we are and we will be in charge in our own country\.”_ 





> _Since taking control of the Polish government in 2015, the autocratic PiS has seized control of state media and the civil service, as well as passing a law to cripple the Polish supreme court by landing it with an unworkable caseload\._ 




#### Italy
### **Rete Solidale Pordenone reports on inefficiency of Italian refugee policies\.**


> “This evening there are 18 people who are sleeping on the street\. We’re still here, looking for blankets or sleeping bags for boys, skinny jeans, sneakers from 41 to 45 and so on and so forth\. We’re still here to show solidarity, to bring some fruit, something to drink or eat, or to even just give a greeting\. 





> These people on the street, continue to be the result of exclusionary policies, governmental short\-sightedness and inefficiency that is still not able to structure a reception that is worthy of that name, not here in Pordenone, nor anywhere else\. 





> When a person asks for the international protection, it must be placed in safe conditions, not left on the road for days and, in some cases, for months\. It is unacceptable and shameful\.”

### Yazidis leave Europe and return to warring Iraq: When death is better than European hatred\.


> _According to [Yazda](http://www.yazda.org/) , a Yazidi advocacy group, ISIL’s assault and occupation of the region led to the [displacement of more than 90 percent](http://www.yazda.org/sample-page-2/) of Iraq’s Yazidi population\. The organisation estimates that around one\-fifth of Iraq’s Yazidis, or 120,000 people, have relocated to Europe\. A small number of Iraqi Yazidi families have returned home after life in Germany failed to meet expectations\._ 





> _One refugee who decided to return says: “_ We were living in a former chicken factory in the city of Oldenberg with hundreds of other refugees and migrants from around the world, and struggled to find anything to fill our days\. I knew nobody _,” he said\. “_ I had no friends\. We thought that anything would be better than Iraq _,” the refugee told [Al Jazeera](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/04/yazidis-leave-europe-return-warring-iraq-160404074817769.html) \. “_ But had we known what the situation would be like, and that we would suffer so much, we would not have gone\. _”_

That way 3,000 children can be helped\.Find out who your local councilor is [here](https://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-councillors) \._ 





> _This is especially necessary seeing that Britain will not accept any refugee children from camps on the European mainland for up to another seven months, Number 10 has admitted\. The Prime Minister’s spokesman said: “It is a new scheme so we need to work with councils to get it up and running and that is why we expect we will have the first children arriving by the end of this year\.”_ 





> _The delay was criticised by Conservative MPs who said the public “expects an urgent response”\. “We were able to relocate 1000 vulnerable refugees from Syria in three months so it should not take seven months before we relocate vulnerable children from Europe\.”_
