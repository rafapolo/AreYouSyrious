Relocations of refugee camps in several places around Greece are still going on\. People are relocated voluntarily at this moment, but soon everybody will have to leave\. Those who agree are moved, by buses, to different government controlled camps around the country\. However, many of these camps are lacking basics, including running water or enough space for people\. People are protesting and asking for human life conditions\. IN may of these camps access is limited, while it is often forbiden for anybody to take photos inside\.

After camp in Idomeni, Greek — Macedonian border, was relocated, a group of independent volunteers started traveling in the area of Thessaloniki, where most of government run camps are, in attempt to collecting information about the situation\. Some of the camps are “new”, others have already existed before the closure of Idomeni\. This is their report\.

_It is difficult to give a unique and general overview about the situations in these camps, therefore we decided to write something about each one of them\. The situation in the new camps is changing continuously and we hope it will also get better\. These information were collected during the last week and we are aware of the fact that probably something has already changed\. We will continue monitoring the situation day by day, thanks to the help of some contacts inside the camps\._

_Overall we can say that inside the camps there are several needs, in particular: food, hygienic\-sanitary, clothes and basic necessities and information\. We are also interested in discovering how the legal assistance will proceed in regard to the international protection for the refugees\._

_We kindly ask to all those who have some information to share them with everyone\._

_Thank you\._
### _Port of Thessaloniki_

_About 340 refugees live at the port of Thessaloniki; most of them are from Iraq and Syria\. They were not in Idomeni before, but they have lived in the port since about 2 months, after spending a period in Kavala\._

_As in other camps, some people live inside of a warehouse, while others live in tents\. The police did not allow us to enter the camp, but we were able to speak with some refugees on the outside\. The information collected give us news about a positive situation in comparison to other camps\. The medical assistance is present for some hours during the day, there is enough water for all and also hot water, internet and electricity\. A Greek organization distributes food two times a day\. We have been informed that it is of a poor quality and not enough\. Some refugees have been “lucky” and they were able to have a skype appointment in an office in Thessaloniki\. They are waiting for news for the beginning of June\._
### _Syndos Frakapori_

_We were not allowed to enter the camp, therefore we collected information from some refugees on the outside of the camp\._

_It is settled in an industrial zone near Thessaloniki\. It is a real desert of abandoned warehouses\. Inside one of them a camp for 800 people with Kurdish origins have been set up\. The tents were pitched both inside and outside the hangar\. It is not allowed to use naked flames, neither burners nor gas\. The only voluntary association that operates inside the camp is MSF that is working for installing electric burners and kettles for warming the milk for kids\._

_For some days water was missing, because the cisterns are insufficient for the number of inhabitants\. The hygienic situation is totally neglected\. Sinks do not drains the water and garbage is not taken away for days, creating the perfect habitat for mosquitos and other insects\. Children are forced to play \(with nothing\) around the garbage\. There are 20 chemical toilets for 800 people\. The food is scarce and bad\. Drinking water is distributed as following: 3 liters per day for a family of 7 people\. There is no internet connection and only a few sockets\. Even the continuous complaints of refugees, police keeps making empty promises\._

_Also the camp of Sindos karamanli is located in the industrial zone near to Thessaloniki\. The military allowed us to enter in the camp\._

_Tents are all pitched inside the hangar\. It is not possible to cook, make a fire, or use electric burners\. In the camp live 600 people, Syrians and Iraqis\. The cleaning service is managed by the refugees themselves, but they complain of a very scarce availability of water\. All the refugees we have talked with say that the food is insufficient and bad\. There is no milk for the newborn\. At the time we were there the Wi\-Fi was being installed\._
### _Oreokastro_

_We were not allowed to enter the governmental camp of Oraiokastro\. According to the refugees we met on the outside, the capacity of the camp is 1500 people\._

_However the inhabitants are 1580; and these 80 people in addition have to access to any service\. Due to the reason they are not registered, they do not receive any food, water or blankets\. Each of them only receive one bottle of water per day\. Also this camp is divided into a protected area \(hangar\) and an external one\._

_Medical assistance is provided only for some hours a day and by a unique doctor\. Water is brought in the camp with huge jerry cans, and often is not enough for everybody\. There are only a few showers and there is no division between men and women\. The Wi\-Fi is present but the connection is weak\. The electric system is insufficient\. So is the cleaning service and there are several mosquitos and snakes\._
### _Kavallari — Sintex_

_We were not able to enter this camp\. According to refugees no volunteers have entered the camp, only military and police\._

_The camp is located in a rural zone 20 km far from Thessaloniki\. The tents are pitched both inside and outside the hangar but they are insufficient, for this reason families have to be split in order to grant a place for everyone\. Through the photos we have seen a similar image to other camps: no care for hygienic conditions\. There are about 250 people in the camp, most of them are Kurdish\. There are 10 toilets and 4 showers that are superficially cleaned every 2 days\. According to the military that monitor the camp, the refugees have to care about cleaning of the toilets and the camp\._

_All the refugees we have talked with say that the food is not enough and bad\. Two times a day they receive a prepackaged sandwich and for lunch a portion of “maccheroni” that has a very unpleasant taste\. Running water does not always work, while drinking water is distributed 1 time a day: 1 liter per person\._

_The medical assistance is provided only by a military doctor that visits the camp every 2 days\. His works consists in distributing paracetamol to anybody who has a problem, even 1 year’s old kids\. Refugees report some cases of diabetes, hypotension and pregnant women\. Besides the insufficient food and the absence medical staff, the ambulances take several hours to reach the camp\._

_There is no internet connection and the sockets are insufficient\. When refugees have tried to ask the military for information the answer was: “ We cannot make promises, but maybe you will be moved to another camp in 3 months\.”_
