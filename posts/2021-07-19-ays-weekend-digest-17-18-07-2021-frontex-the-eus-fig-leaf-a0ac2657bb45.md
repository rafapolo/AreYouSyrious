#### FEATURED: Frontex, the EU’s fig leaf

On Thursday July 15, the Frontex Scrutiny Working Group \(FSWG\) within the European Parliament delivered its final “ [Report on the fact\-finding investigation on Frontex concerning alleged fundamental rights violations](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2014_2019/plmrep/COMMITTEES/LIBE/DV/2021/07-14/14072021FinalReportFSWG_EN.pdf) \.”

The group was set up in January following the publication of a series of journalistic investigations into the role of Frontex in pushbacks and collective expulsions in the Aegean Sea\. Published last autumn by Der Spiegel, Bellingcat, Lighthouse Reports, ARD and TV Asahi, these investigations showed how the European border agency actively participated in pushbacks carried out by the Greek coast guard\.

The European Parliament was pressured into starting its own fact finding investigation after Frontex absolved itself in a ludicrous self\-investigation, in which it fundamentally proposed to re\-conceptualise illegal pushbacks as lawful border security actions, and people seeking refuge as potential threats\.

The final report [delivered](https://multimedia.europarl.europa.eu/en/committee-on-civil-liberties-justice-and-home-affairs_20210715-0900-COMMITTEE-LIBE_vd) on Thursday “did not find conclusive evidence on the direct performance of pushbacks and/or collective expulsions\.” This unsurprising conclusion is the product of the very limited scope that the FSWG gave itself\. As noted by [Abolish Frontex](https://abolishfrontex.org/blog/2021/07/16/frontex-off-the-hook/) , the FSWG “did not agree to hear the testimonies of those who have suffered human rights violations or even examine actual forensic evidence of pushbacks\.” As a result:


> the report hardly gives attention to what [Frontex](https://abolishfrontex.org/frontex/) is actually doing at the borders and the harm and violence stemming from the agency’s actions\. 




Nonetheless — as media [report](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-migration-frontex-pushbacks-illegal-parliament-report/) — the findings highlight how Frontex has gathered “evidence in support of allegations of fundamental rights violations in \[EU\] member states with which it had a joint operation, but failed to address and follow\-up on these violations promptly, vigilantly and effectively,” Other observers went further, pointing directly at Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri’s responsibilities in covering up pushbacks in the Aegean\. According to [EUobserver](https://euobserver.com/migration/152459) , Leggeri “allegedly destroyed incriminating evidence of an illegal pushback by the Greek coast guard\.” And [Der Spiegel](https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/gefluechtete-in-griechenland-frontex-wusste-von-menschenrechtsverletzungen-und-tat-nichts-a-6efe96dc-b4f6-47e9-b4a9-f9b789d2da17) states, “Leggeri personally instructed the fundamental rights officer to delete all information she had collected about the incident\.”

In a normal world, this alone should be more than enough to signal the need to dismantle the agency, which in numerous occasions has justified its operations at sites of alleged human rights violations stating that its very presence would reduce abuse and violence\.

The FSWG’s report focused on the [managerial mismanagement](https://twitter.com/Balkanizator/status/1415557428381421572) within Frontex, especially regarding the failure to hire 40 fundamental rights officers, for which several deadlines have been missed\. During the same time, however, the Executive Director has increased his own office’s staff to 63 people\. By now, months since the last deadline, only 5 fully\-fledged and independent fundamental rights monitors have been hired, together with 15 assistants\.

> > 7/ The FSWG has failed its job badly. Violence &amp; human rights violations are the cornerstone of border control &amp; Frontex is directly responsible for this violence. Any attempt to ensure the respect of human rights must entail abolishing Frontex and the system it represents.

As Lena K\. [points out](https://twitter.com/lk2015r/status/1415614288794984449) , “the roots of the problem, though, are structural: Frontex is by law tasked with participating in the activities that produce human rights violations AND with reporting & preventing them, through internal mechanisms, within a policy context that privileges border protection\.” In this way, Frontex ends up being a legitimator of violations, or as MEP Erik Marquardt puts it, a ‘fig leaf’\.

GREECE
#### Arrivals to Samos Denied

[Daphne Tolis reports](https://twitter.com/daphnetoli/status/1416399813042753538) that nine people thought to be from Syria and Palestine arrived on Saturday morning\. [While Alarm Phone state](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1416300465839542277) that a Palestinian man reached the Aegean island by swimming\.


> He is dehydrated and weak, but alive\. He is urgently asking for protection in Europe\. 





Despite confirmation by an eye witness authorities state there were no arrivals\.
#### People not allowed to leave Moria 2 on Lesvos

Plus thread on background situation\.

[Tolis also reports](https://twitter.com/daphnetoli/status/1416101886961324034?fbclid=IwAR1UJNzfIsQ4dtGkC43Z1hd5f6fOUgQ0vhK7yZmrqV9LLBQwwOVDGzQKBU8) that a young man in Corinth detention centre has been self harming but was refused medical treatment\. It is just over three months since a [24\-year\-old Kurdish man died by suicide](ays-weekend-digest-27-28-3-2021-italian-french-border-eviction-of-the-casa-cantoniera-ed26bf69273c) at the same detention centre\.
#### Operation of Regional Asylum Offices until 25\.07\.2021


> [The Asylum Service informs](https://www.facebook.com/migrationgovgr.info/posts/1987290714758357) that in accordance with the measures for protecting public health and preventing the spread of COVID\-19, the public can visit Regional Asylum Services only after scheduling an appointment\. This includes interviews and registrations\. 





> According to the relevant Joint Ministerial Decision of 16–7–2021, Regional Asylum Offices are going to serve only urgent registrations, as well as notification of decisions, lodging of appeals, delivery of travel documents and deposition of Dublin documents until July 25th 2021\. A specific number of interviews will take place only for applicants who have been contacted and invited either by phone or officially by Service staff to confirm their interview appointment\. 





> We remind you of the obligation to use a mask inside the building \(and outside of it in case the premise is overcrowded\) \.

[Police violence continues](https://www.facebook.com/KeshaNiyaProject/posts/1563436204001241) at the border between Ventimiglia and Menton with people being held for more than 48 hours in an overcrowded container and repeated reports of people being beaten\. One person with a leg injury reported that the police took his crutch from him and used it to hit him\. Pushbacks also remain high\.


![\(“Attached you find a tabella with the number of pushbacked people per day\.

BELGIUM
#### Hunger strike continues

After 55 days [the hunger strikers decide to continue](https://www.facebook.com/OccupationPolitiques2021/posts/464615961444004) \.

UK
#### Long waits for asylum Decisions

Despite Home Office statements that the majority of asylum claims receive a [decision within six months](https://www.gov.uk/claim-asylum/decision) , [The Guardian has recently revealed](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/06/fix-broken-asylum-system-shocking-backlog-cases) that there are more than 50,000 people who have been waiting more than six months for an initial decision\. The new Nationality and Borders Bill would only exacerbate this problem as people who arrive in the UK ‘irregularly’ will be forced to wait six months before they can even begin the process of filing their initial claim\.
#### Home Office continues persecution of Zimbabweans

The Home Office is continuing it’s attempts to [deport people to Zimbabwe](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/zimbabwe-deportation-charter-detention-home-office-b1884636.html?fbclid=IwAR2qnxnXyD9LvbcaMCyMzLSSBKLRcJqLyrQ8cfOFKgJ3As-HBEr2l7vYO8U) despite the risks they face or the lives they have built in the UK\. They are currently threatening to deport a father of three British children two of whom have serious health problems\.

GENERAL
#### Canada to accept human rights defenders and journalists as refugees

The Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Minister Marco Mendicino has announced that Canada will take in 250 people a year under this new scheme, plus their families\. The focus will be on people at heightened risk, such as women, journalists and LGBTQ2 rights advocates\.
