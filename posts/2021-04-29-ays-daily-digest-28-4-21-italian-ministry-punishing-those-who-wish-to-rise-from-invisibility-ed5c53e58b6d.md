ITALY — **Ministry’s circular email with a decision that could result in thousands losing their residency** 
Over 200,000 people are facing serious consequences of the recent decision that was sent out on 21 April by the Ministry of the Interior, as it “creates new and additional obstacles, punishing once again those who want to emerge from invisibility,” [reports](https://www.meltingpot.org/Illogico-e-illegittimo-impedire-la-regolarizzazione-a-chi.html?var_mode=calcul&fbclid=IwAR0u_P4P5Rbo1oRKtUi8M-TvRQNMhbCFAYXWbTVXB47aRCPadcz9QIcOCIs#.YIra7pAzY2z) Meltingpot\.

In a letter addressed to the President of the Council, the Ministries of the Interior, Health, Labour and Agriculture, many organisations from Italy have stood up for the people who risk losing their residency permit when they are between jobs, that is, “in the event of the conclusion of a fixed\-term employment relationship pending the regularisation procedure, it would not be possible to obtain a residence permit for the time of awaiting employment\.”

These provisions are unlawful, the organisations state, because the law in force provides that, in the event of a loss of employment, even in the case of a seasonal contract, a permit should be issued for waiting for employment, by which the person concerned may regularly seek other employment\.

“Regularisation is — by the same token as the standard that provided for it — the instrument to ensure the regularity of the stay and an adequate health standard to thousands of people who live and work in Italy for a long time, and it must not become a matter of political dispute, to the detriment of their lives,” the undersigned associations remind the authorities\.


> They risk further jeopardizing the already fragile application of the law 




For this reason, the signatories of the letter request that the decision of 21 April 2021 be immediately revoked in the compliance with their demands\.

The associations who signed the letter are: ASGI, Amnesty International Italia, ARCI, ACLI, Oxfam Italia, ActionAid, Centro Astalli, Senza Confine, CNCA, Europasilo, Intersos, Casa Dei Diritti Sociali, Medici del Mondo Italia, SIMM, MEDU, Medici contro la tortura, Forum per Cambiare l’Ordine delle Cose, Sanità di Frontiera, ActionAid, Centro Astalli, Fondazione Migrantes, Federazione delle Chiese Evangeliche in Italia, A Buon Diritto Onlus, Comunità di Sant’Egidio and Campagna Ero Straniero\.

DENMARK — **Fatal interpretation of the data which informed the Danish government’s decision\-making process** 
As we have been reporting in the past weeks, many organisations and other institutions in Denmark and abroad have expressed strong disagreement, critique and concerns over the Danish decision that “Damascus is safe for returns”\. As the officials have remained unwilling to engage with criticisms of the report, maintaining confidence in the ability of Danish authorities to evaluate security conditions in Syria, some are reaching out to prove them wrong\.
Condemning the decision and criticising the misuse of expert testimony in the processes that ultimately led to the denial of asylum for some groups of Syrians, one of the organisations critical of the Danish government’s decision, COAR, wrote an invaluable report in response that assesses the claims made by Danish authorities, examines the asylum procedures employed in Denmark, and assesses the relationship between these processes and the relevant local context in Syria\. Among other things, they clearly state that “sustained and systematic **human rights abuses under the Government of Syria are among the most pervasive and well\-documented in history** ”\.


> In contrast with the Danish decision, this report concludes that no part of Syria is safe for return\. Most notably, it finds that the recent Danish decisions concerning asylum procedures misconstrue the relationship between large\-scale conflict in Syria and the security and protection conditions that relate to return\.

The EU presented a [new strategy](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dw.com%2Fen%2Feu-presents-strategy-to-send-unauthorized-migrants-back%2Fa-57355522%3Fmaca%3Den-rss-en-eu-2092-rdf%26fbclid%3DIwAR3oeSXfhuw-XJFMWzK6I_EJcY0Ym7oEILl9qzO9DESUV0tchx5GipuEJ5I&h=AT2V70N-7ypWTNAAZqj9GEdWod2BRaf7YO1lzAwOj--_e17CNcn_086aZyw8IWDCkxmEkK2ylWsMnPsZa2If8XaKZ7hekXEX0SZSQTss2l0F6pIvGQ-G9sY6hTuKg46iou2_V8HT7xyl6w&__tn__=R]-R&c[0]=AT0DWMD-IA4NcLmUoUqHMRtThm8jQuZcxlenOzc5F7ZIXcSMsz0pn8yeASRL_600y6xdUeTCtXsg4zxj-AkoPkaE8nBBbRRgyEfT_BgVYFLAkAAwki2Ocqg_ZBwPG7mMTvEOTo8J8IEEHqdzvKqQ3fWQsmrmrVTR1oDloaKKhAoPQrXpSooqegrUn2E1ZamCaxocvL9H_u3_syFRVA) to persuade reluctant home countries to take back asylum\-seekers they are rejecting\. It forms part of a larger reform package on migration, “which includes counseling for migrants who arrive without authorization, as well as extolling the benefits of returning home”\.
Smoother legal and operational procedures to deport them, and the use of development aid or visa restrictions to convince countries to take them back are among the diplomatic weapons included in the plan\. Along with that, it seems that the EU will try to have any of the countries along the route\(s\) take the people \(back\) in, one of the most recent obvious examples being Bosnia and Herzegovina\.
#### GREECE
### Greek Ombudsman published interim report of his investigation into pushbacks to Turkey \(2017–2020\)


> The report provides a brief, concise overview of the Ombudsman’s own\-initiative inquiry from June 2017 through the end of 2020\. It presents key aspects of the reported incidents, records the handling of the allegations by the Greek authorities and makes proposals, in the direction of shielding legality, enhancing transparency, and ensuring full respect for the principles of the rule of law\. The interim report has already been sent to the Minister of Citizens’ Protection and the Chief of the Police\. 






[![https://drive\.google\.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https%3A//www\.synigoros\.gr/resources/docs/280421\-pushbacks\-interim\-report\-eng\.pdf&embedded=true]( "https://drive\.google\.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https%3A//www\.synigoros\.gr/resources/docs/280421\-pushbacks\-interim\-report\-eng\.pdf&embedded=true")](https://drive.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https%3A//www.synigoros.gr/resources/docs/280421-pushbacks-interim-report-eng.pdf&embedded=true)


The report interestingly presents a long list of all the police stations that reportedly investigated the pushback allegations themselves and found that they, of course, have not been involved nor have they ever contravened human rights\. The Ombudsman office claims they haven’t been given what they need to investigate properly and so they can’t conclude that pushbacks are indeed happening \. The Ombudsman called for the Greek police to conduct more formal investigations and make an operational plan for dealing with these “unidentified groups” performing the pushbacks\.

At the same time, five Greek civil society organisations [requested](https://www.humanrights360.org/greek-civil-society-requests-european-commission-assessment-on-respect-of-eu-asylum-law-safeguards-at-the-greek-borders/?fbclid=IwAR1bWsMyyHo430sEN_kLoNY0nTwAsEZxHfwgbpgzi4FrdDpJ0HV-pf0DffM) the European Commission’s assessment of compliance by Greece with procedural requirements attached to the _non\-refoulement_ principle and obligations to provide access to asylum at its land and sea borders\.


> Despite the denial of all pushback allegations over the past year as ‘fake news’, the Greek authorities have not demonstrated up to now what steps they are taking to identify the people intercepted upon their attempt to enter Greece, and to provide them with the opportunity to raise potential risks of _refoulement_ prior to being directed to Turkey\. 




### No education for children on the move

Most of the children of refugees are excluded from the education system in Greece\. RSA interviewed various actors from the education sector and refugee families with children between 15 January and 15 February 2021 and published a [report](https://rsaegean.org/en/excluded-and-segregated-the-vanishing-education-of-refugee-children-in-greece/) on access to the education system for refugee children in Greece\.
#### HUNGARY
### More scrutiny awaiting the NGOs

The Civilisation Coalition, founded in response to the infamous law on transparency that curbed foreign\-funded NGOs, has [expressed concern](https://www.euractiv.com/section/justice-home-affairs/news/hungarian-civil-society-raises-alarm-over-ngo-law-change/?fbclid=IwAR3BP-DNS7kVZGuJObrXdlGL1-lsBODV2Qj5ablzioyh_QnTC6fOef3SLAA) over the announced changes to legislation on NGOs\. These include practice of the State Audit Office \(ÁSZ\) to carry out and publish annual audits of NGOs with a budget of over €55,000, even if the organisations do not receive public funds, excluding sports and religious organisations\.

As reported earlier, the European Court of Justice, based in Luxembourg, ruled in June 2020 that the restrictions notably violated the freedom of movement of capital and freedom of association\. Following that, two months ago the European Commission pressured the Hungarian authorities to implement the ruling, notifying Hungary they are considered in breach of the treaties\.
#### AUSTRIA
### Austrian minister arranging for returns to Bosnia and Herzegovina

Austria is working on legalizing chain pushback practices, as a newly signed letter of intent between Austria’s Minister Karl Nehammer and Selmo Cikotić, Minister of Security of Bosnia and Herzegovina, seems to show\. Just as a reminder, in 2020, official government data indicated that Austria formally returned 176 people to the Slovenian police\. Many of these returns were carried out through Croatia and ended in Bosnia, Serbia or beyond\.

With the aim of reportedly drawing up return plans with the countries he visited, the Austrian minister Nehammer is also arranging for the people they deem to be a “security problem”, to be returned “from the Balkan countries to the countries of origin”\. They claim the aim is to “convince the people it does not make sense to put thousands of euros into the hands of smugglers without having the prospect of a residence permit in the EU”, Nehammer stressed\.

He fails to mention that there is not much sense in trusting the international laws, asylum system, Charter of the Human Rights and the national rule of law, as many have witnessed personally\. 
The planned repatriations are to be organised operationally via the “Platform against Illegal Migration” announced last summer in Vienna\. The EU Commission is, of course, also involved in the coordination\.

A number of mostly Austrian organisations have expressed sharp criticism over the plan to establish a repatriation plan for people on the move with Bosnia and Herzegovina\. Nehammer also announced that Austria will provide €500,000 for burned\-down Camp Lipa so that it can be made winterproof\. However, by now it is clear to everyone they are not building or supporting the asylum system, but rather undermining both the systems as well as the countries they are implemented in, ignoring with these quick fixes the severe deficits in asylum systems across the Western Balkans\.


> If Austria wants to help the western Balkans, then it should support these countries in building rule\-of\-law asylum procedures\. However, if people who can’t expect fair proceedings in these countries should be deported simply and help Austria, it turns into an accomplice to a breach of international law “, Maria — _Maria Katharina Moser, Director of the Diaconie Austria_ 




#### FRANCE
### Evictions continue

Another expulsion took place on Tuesday morning behind Conforama in Coquelles, reported [L’Auberge des Migrants](https://www.facebook.com/AubergeMigrants/?__cft__[0]=AZV0euMkgARe2niZ1qB7p4bSJ2DiVELNp_BHJSWQOo1yILrawP_LJvUhxh1YpBhHwL4dfBy7jqyilYfhBrdKaCcwPFzaaJv6Gdzf7r-vKxAXcs0ak74aYrcqmmZtm05BHGOcYto1mN0bmCrQPOO2QAUF&__tn__=-UC%2CP-R) \. The reasons remain unknown and questions are raised about respect for the rights of the people on the move\. About 100 people were reportedly forced to board buses heading to unknown destinations under the pretext of shelter, as Human Rights Observers teams witnessed\.

### Dramatic increase in mortality in 2020 among people born abroad

Foreign\-born populations experienced twice as much excess mortality in 2020 during the first wave of the COVID\-19 pandemic than those born in France, according to a [survey](https://www.insee.fr/en/accueil) by the French National Institute of Statistics published this month\.


> The number of deaths is most significant among people from Africa\. While the number of deaths in France increased by an average of 9% last year compared to 2019, with 669,000 deaths, that of foreign people jumped by 17%, _as_ _is [reported](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/31746/foreign-born-people-have-twice-the-excess-mortality-than-french-nationals?fbclid=IwAR3QrO8lFj2UDm6APi-m42eaoZNfD7fpZ-stDo3kjNkpaeh0mgRrKNuxeXI) \._ 




#### GERMANY
### Court decided freedom of faith and conscience overrule “illegality”

This Monday, the district court in Kitzingen ruled that while a Benedictine monk “unlawfully” committed assistance to illegal stay, the freedom of faith, conscience and creed guaranteed by Germany’s constitution was more important\. Although the ruling isn’t legally binding yet, on account of the freedom of faith and conscience laid out in the German constitution, providing church asylum in the case of the monk who housed a man from the Gaza Strip, it [ended](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.infomigrants.net%2Fen%2Fpost%2F31815%2Fgerman-monk-acquitted-in-trial-on-church-asylum%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR37Aid4op_Vrjdyvlh5qj3gW9GeiXqxSPlEPkVezX9H_tOQSg9VN5P67hU&h=AT2DQDkzp6DRqMme4GZYYh6Nfg5giqyarvDk-9EjCzyPlEk8qsTlby0WMBbZcr5c-Vb1YMVujLPhwEy5fJ99DCaEtmAi5YEtkdTgXQ2VSactJ7C77AcBiVgCxMZBIGBuuf3IEQZtJTXCkA&__tn__=R]-R&c[0]=AT3gWe1oJy-JZZr-0wVsFruCIm8Ut97j9m9SBCWw-FUq1iEqTBVCFdaXSKm__xxfaTug66CX7gFLqaFNwuawenbTPrrPMlI4y3fo9JLTY3EnvcmJr46kP4mT1tsHyQ-9oDjspSoUGtR0zNLdF5AhmP9yPJyPDndftM8zmLUOy5chNqMAWVdqSnsHGCl4oCaxWT3XhHgG6y2srSXURw) with the Court ruling out punishment in this singular case\.
### Family of five separated at deportation, a child left behind

An Armenian family was separated during a deportation — a minor remained in Germany and has been missing since then\. 
After public criticism, the city of Ludwigshafen announced that it would examine the case, [reported](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.migazin.de%2F2021%2F04%2F26%2Ffuenfkoepfige-familie-bei-abschiebung-getrennt-minderjaehriger-wurde-zurueckgelassen%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR22cLZ6XRbAroPKYs1inlXC_d9JpWgRnd4uyslpy3odOaWc1GElmyTtxj0&h=AT3xHcEY_3JA-fJQ3IPKf2-2VLKSfyXUtqWJxFtRB21DThxCEgbmCU9xsMGb9RhrTHaj5avjOAObYLexx-G7U6zT7TFvuyOHMoQ3_HNHfJiyujaU6eDKaGOivnX7BFY9oA&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT1sZwRPdLonM81pQK5WFhvB97gPY_d3DhFak9Stxem9hjBkYlNeq8l-3PyzCOGs0BgmxKASumQWDbnFq_y1TXHToj4xOgVF0E8Q14dB2MEXDi5QF-tq7WyxvUVeH0LAa7gFL11iS42OPPF3kmVEaOYJubhSiQ4rEGuJVPdfDCDS5Qk8aDl44c-KUawxAzj8OP4WqtvQgNnO0PCT1w) the media\.
#### UK
### Red alert over Napier


> ALL these barracks, camps and detention centres must be SHUT DOWN\! 





[Protest in solidarity](https://www.facebook.com/movementforjustice/posts/5500583429983981) with those inside the Napier barracks was held today, Wednesday, 28 April\.

A number of organisations across the UK have spoken against the Napier barracks, and now the Red Cross has underlined the danger of re\-traumatising people who have fled war\. Their report said people had experienced flashbacks of violence from living inside barbed wire fences\. It also mentions “delays in the system, a failure to provide basic items such as clothing and financial support, ineffective health screening and barriers to accessing healthcare\.”


> “We have heard from people without basic items like clean clothing, staying in rooms in disrepair, or with serious medical needs that have been ignored\.” — M\. Adamson
