#### FEATURED STORIES
### Additional pressure piles up on local volunteers

**Tuzla \(Bosnia and Herzegovina\)** — It has been months since a couple of Tuzlans started assisting people on the move passing through their city on their way towards the western part of Bosnia and Herzegovina\. Since then, as we keep reporting, the number of those arriving, as well as the number of locals who joined in helping have risen\. However, despite all efforts, many warnings and calls for help \(as well as taking up responsibility\), none of the addressed institutions or officials have done anything concrete for things to change\. No international organisation comes to support the efforts of locals feeding and supplying people with everything they need, or to check the state of people traveling \(the reason these organisations exist in the first place\), to offer solutions to the growing fear of health hazards, or to influence the ones who can make the crucial decisions\. This is why there are more and more photos and accounts from Tuzla that speak of yet another case of neglect, ignorance and what seems like a deliberate decision to abandon both the ones arriving, and those \(still\) willing to help them\.
A local volunteer wrote this today, perhaps best describing what is happening:


> The migrant story is getting a new dimension, in the centre of Tuzla\. We have warned about this xy times\. Tents come next\. It seems like one would need a special cistern to clean up the feces in the nearby building\. I don’t even look to see what the situation is like around the other buildings, but it’s obvious the neighbors don’t like the whole situation, which is understandable\. What we can’t understand is that they express it from time to time by yelling at some of the volunteers — “take them home\!”\. What they don’t understand is that we didn’t decide to install the Foreigners office here, nor do we bring people here, and they _will_ sit there until they receive their paper\. Speaking of home, we would like to bring them home, but even for that we need an official permission\. This way, we are limited in every possible way\. 
 

> It’s been a long time that we’ve been suggesting 24hour shift of the Office, so people would not have to sleep rough and the number of people would not grow\. Imagine when this office doesn’t work for a few days for the holidays, or during the weekend, and people arrive non stop\. I am sorry for the people who work there, too, because they also suffer due to inadequate reaction\. The fear of the imaginary, hate speech in the social media, superficial reports in the media who don’t focus on the problem, gossips and hear\-say\. \.all of that only deepens and complicates things both for migrants and for us\. 
 

> Imagine those families with children sitting there for two days …

> In the past months we have managed to prevent more problems, but now it is getting more and more difficult\. We feed them clothe them and direct them to the Office\. These are human beings and this must be in the first place, and not a 1000 times ‘why’\. They are here, whatever someone might think\. Besides, it is also about the principles and reputation of our city and state\. The rules change all the time, only to the damage of migrants, who are already tortured enough, but also for the entire community\. As a result you have the existing situation and you see this:

### Number of people allowed to ask for asylum downsized, push backs continue in Slovenia

**Slovenia\-Croatia border** — While their Croatian counterparts catch international attention with their inhumane approach towards people at the border, but also those in different cities attempting to realize their human and international rights, the Slovenian police has silently been working hand in hand with them\. According to the official statistics, there were 9,100 illegal border crossings registered last year from Croatia to Slovenia\. Police practice started to change sometime around June last year\. Under the **readmission agreement between Croatia and Slovenia** , the Slovenian police started practicing collective expulsions working in collaboration with their colleagues from Croatia, in mixed police patrols\. 
From May 25, Slovenian activists claim, Slovenian police would return most of the people they encountered at the border\. The Croatian police didn’t confirm existence of such collaboration, but the agreed instruction was such\. People would then be returned by the Croatian police back to Bosnia and Herzegovina, more often than not, in violent push back practices — sometimes after beatings, after burning people’s shoes, taking their possessions and stripping them of the remains of dignity they still were left with\. 
At the Slovenian border police station Črnomelj \(the closest one to Velika Kladuša\) in May 2018, 98% of people who were crossing the border \(a total of 397\), were allowed to apply for asylum, 371 people did so\. Only a month afterwards, in June, just 3% of the people who crossed the border were able to apply for asylum — it means that out of 412 people in total, **only 13 were allowed to ask for international protection** \.

The average percentage of people who were able to apply for asylum in the period from June to December 2018 in the station of Črnomelj was 14% \. There is no official documentation available to us to corroborate this, but the Slovenian police has been using the readmission agreement from 2006 in order to expel people to Croatia, and subsequently to Bosnia and Herzegovina\. **The same practice continues on the border** \.

Activists from Slovenia who have been monitoring and documenting the situation say that on average, people walk from Velika Kladuša or Bihać \(BiH\) to Slovenia for 10–15 days, and due to being very exhausted, many are caught by the border police patrols\. As the police and official pressure piles up, there are fewer activists available to organize help\. 
The people are taken to the police station, their information, photo and fingerprints are taken there and, what is particularly worrying, **the police translators act as interrogators\.** People are held in cells or containers for a few days and the conditions usually depend on the will and wit of the individual police officers deployed in the station\. They are normally afterwards taken by the Croatian police back towards the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina and — pushed back\.

In 2018, out of the 9,100 people who crossed the border to Slovenia, according to the bilateral agreement data, **4,600 were expelled \(pushed back** \) to Croatia\.

This is just a tiny part of the information collected and analyzed by the activists from Slovenia who have managed to establish communication with people on the move, having intervened many times with the police to allow them to ask for asylum\.

**They have documented most of the push back cases that they published in a valuable special report we will publish separately\.**

In general, **it is not easy to change incorrect information on your white card** \.


> Therefore, it is essential to make sure that you give the police your correct details when you get your police note \(“kharti”\) and also most importantly the Asylum Service when they ask for your details\. Please double\-check the information you provide to the authorities and insist that wrong data is corrected\! In case you need to change your details on your white card, you will need an original passport or original ID card from your country of origin\. If you don’t have that you will have to provide a birth certificate or marriage certificate, which will need to be validated and officially translated to Greek\. All documents you bring to provide your correct details need to be original, a picture or copy is not enough\. With the document proving your correct details, you need to go to the Regional Asylum Office responsible for you and make an application to change your data\.
