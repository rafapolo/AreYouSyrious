**FEATURED — A 5\-year\-old child is the 240th victim of the Balkan Route**

As we [reported](ays-daily-digest-30-07-2021-fatal-shipwreck-off-the-coast-of-greece-c3a69e9267f3) on Friday, a five\-year\-old boy [drowned](https://www.klix.ba/vijesti/crna-hronika/petogodisnjak-se-utopio-u-rijeci-uni-prilikom-pokusaja-prelaska-granice-s-roditeljima/210730022) around midnight on Thursday in the Una River in Bosanski Novi/Novi Grad\. According to the available information, the child died while the family was trying to cross into the Una River in Croatia\.

This is at least the 240th death of the Balkan route since mid\-2013, a German [research](https://www.br.de/nachrichten/deutschland-welt/die-toten-auf-der-balkanroute,SVlgSiF) [states](https://twitter.com/ARDstudioWien/status/1421064036704215042) \. 70 people died since March 2019\. “They were shot, suffocated, froze to death, drowned, were run over by trains and died in car accidents\. Some committed suicide\. Sick people died because they received inadequate medical care\.” All are victims of European border policies\.

The research covers the national territories of North Macedonia, Bulgaria, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Hungary, Slovenia and Austria\. Local and national authorities should investigate every death in their country, but little was done to identify many of the victims, and the number of unreported deaths may still be very high\. Local organisations or muslim communities have often covered the expenses for identification, contacting the relatives, and in some cases for burials\.

SEA
#### Central Mediterranean: rescues and pushbacks

Over a thousand people have been [returned](https://twitter.com/msehlisafa/status/1421798173585158146) to Libya since Friday and at least 28 were [intercepted](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1421893154870018049) by the Tunisian coast guard\.

Thanks to the support of ResQ, Sea Watch 3 and Ocean Viking rescued hundreds of people over the weekend\.

At the moment of writing, 263 people are [on board](https://twitter.com/seawatch_intl/status/1422100630919917570) of Sea Watch 3, while 555 are [on board](https://twitter.com/SOSMedIntl/status/1421871864545267716) Ocean Viking\. Both have alerted European authorities of many more distress cases at sea\.

CYPRUS
#### **Pushback** to Lebanon

Cypriot NGO KISA [denounce](https://twitter.com/KISAOfficial/status/1420743889615409153) a pushback of 90 people from Syria who were arrested on arrival on July 27, detained for two days and pushed back to Lebanon on Thursday 29\. No information has been released by the Cypriot police who carried out the pushback\.

GREECE
#### Greece and Turkey blame each others over averted shipwreck while people die and pushbacks carry on

On Friday, the Greek ministry of asylum and migration released a [statement](https://twitter.com/migrationgovgr) blaming Turkey for not rescuing a boat in distress in Turkish waters north of Lesvos island\. The boat, carrying 10 people, was rescued by the Hellenic Coast Guard, which in itself is a very rare occurrence\. Over the weekend, the two countries’ authorities published videos and counter statements in a blame game we have witnessed many times before\. Turkish officials [contest](https://twitter.com/daphnetoli/status/1421803058061791239) that the rescue happened in Turkish water, while Greece has accused Turkey of faking its pushbacks videos\.

In the meantime, people die\. Turkish media have [reported](https://www.evros-news.gr/2021/08/01/%cf%84%ce%bf%cf%85%cf%81%ce%ba%ce%b9%ce%ba%ce%ac-%ce%b4%ce%b7%ce%bc%ce%bf%cf%83%ce%b9%ce%b5%cf%8d%ce%bc%ce%b1%cf%84%ce%b1-%ce%b1%ce%bd%ce%b1%cf%86%ce%ad%cf%81%ce%bf%ce%bd%cf%84%ce%b1%ce%b9-%cf%83/) that a man was shot and killed on one of the islets on the Evros river, where he went to retrieve the small boats used by people on the move\. What actually happened is still unclear, with some sources claiming he was shot by Greek soldiers and others that he was shot by civilians on the Greek side of the border\. The Greek ministry of foreign affairs [issued](https://twitter.com/lk2015r/status/1421803894636744704) a blanket denial over the responsibility of Greek soldiers for the death of the man\.

Stefanos Levidis, Forensic Architecture researcher, went to Antikythera, small island in southwestern Aegean, to investigate first hand the [allegations of abuses and pushbacks](https://kythera.news/peplo-siopis-to-kratos-se-kythira-antikythira/amp/) which took place on July 4\.

> > Pbacks are a daily occurrence in the Aegean. The modus operandi here is no different. It is the geography that stands out. 

Antikythera lies some 370km from the Greek-Turkish maritime border, where the Aegean and Ionian Seas meet. The entire Aegean is now a pushback zone.

BULGARIA
#### More pushbacks

Josoor [report](https://twitter.com/JosoorNet/status/1421811448183992320) of a violent pushback which took place last week from Bulgaria to Turkey against two young men, who were arrested, beaten and robbed by Bulgarian border police and left with no help on the Turkish side of the border\.

GERMANY
#### Court rules Italy not safe for refugees

A court in the German federal state of North Rhine\-Westphalia has ruled in favour of two asylum seekers, one from Somalia and the other Mali, whose asylum applications had been rejected because they came into the EU via Italy, media report\. [The court has decided](https://www.ovg.nrw.de/behoerde/presse/pressemitteilungen/45_210729/index.php) that, because they could expect inhumane or degrading treatment if sent back to Italy, their asylum claims should be heard in Germany\.
#### Federal interior minister Seehofer pledges to increase deportations to Afghanistan

Despite the advance of the Talibans in Afghanistan, federal interior minister Seehofer has revealed that German authorities are negotiating with their Afghan counterparts to increase the numbers of deportation flights to the countries, media [report](https://www.zdf.de/nachrichten/politik/seehofer-abschiebungen-asyl-afghanistan-100.html) \. At the moment, only those labelled criminals and ‘endengerers’ or terrorist threats are deported\. As we wrote in our [Special on Germany](ays-special-from-germany-seehofer-decides-syria-is-safe-5f751720d407) last December, this has allowed for the deportation of hundreds of people who committed no crime at all\.

UK
#### Home Office uses fake news to deter people from reaching the UK

Media [revealed](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/english-channel-crossings-home-office-website-b1894092.html) that the Home Office set up a website — onthemove\.org — which contains many incorrect information about the risks of travelling to the UK\. The website presents itself as not connected to the authorities, and carries slogans such as “don’t put your or your child’s life in danger”, “we will return you” and “there is no hiding place”\. People on the move in France were targeted with a costly advertising campaign over the last few months, with personalised ads in different languages linking to this website\. The website _inform_ the readers that steering a small boat over the English Channel is a crime and that authorities “regularly returns” people arriving via irregular routes\. Both this claims are far from the truth: prosecutions for steering small boats have recently been limited by the Crown Prosecution Service and and deportations to other EU countries have stopped as a consequence of Brexit\.
#### 10 year waiting for asylum claims

Media [report](https://twitter.com/AllieHBNews/status/1421576458640805889) that at least 400 people are still waiting to know if they can remain in the UK, after applying more than a decade ago\.
