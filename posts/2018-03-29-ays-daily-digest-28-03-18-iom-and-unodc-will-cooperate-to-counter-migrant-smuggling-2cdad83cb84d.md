#### Feature

In order to counter migrant smuggling the _International Organization for Migration \(IOM\)_ and the _United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime \(UNODC\)_ , have today announced a new co\-operation between the two bodies — the Joint Platform on Countering Migrant Smuggling\. The Executive Director of _UNODC_ , Yury Fedotow, opened the event in Vienna by saying:


> “We must work together to deny criminals the means and opportunity, to protect the lives and safety of people, and end the impunity of smugglers\.” 




He is welcoming this new collaboration, and in the press\-release it says that:


> “Promoting and facilitating orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration as stated in Sustainable Development Goal \(SDG\) 10 is essential for saving lives, promoting regular and orderly migration, putting migrant smugglers out of business and leading to inclusive development\.” 




On the other hand we are welcoming all initiatives to create safe routes\. This can be humanitarian corridors that remain open and avoid the creation of bottlenecks, quota systems or some other solution\. But by eliminating the only alternative people have \(how dangerous, potentially abusive and expensive it may be\) without offering better ways to safety, no one will become more included or safe\. “Regular and orderly”, as written in the press release from IOM and UNODC is not a way that the European asylum politics has worked for at least two\-three years, more like “unjust and exclusive”\. Nothing was mentioned about his by either Yury Fedotow or anyone else quoted in the press release\.

Maybe someone will be able to clap another’s shoulder in a conference room, imagining they are defeating the smugglers\. Then they will sit down at their desks and write a similar report like this one, but with the results\. And we will be able to read the results\.

At the same time, another smuggler will get in touch with another desperate refugee on the other side of the Black Sea, the Mediterranean, in Port Patras, in Belgrade or Sid in Serbia, Calais or elsewhere\. By the time the smuggler is behind bars in a jail somewhere, will they then have a hot meal, a warm bed and a safe place to stay? Or will they still be in transit, waiting for something to happen?

Dear _IOM_ and _UNODC_ , the only way to really “counter migrant smuggling” is to offer those people who have no alternatives better alternatives\. Otherwise, they will continue trying in any way they can\. Your methods of trying to save lives by catching the “bad guys” \(who in some cases for sure also have saved lives, as it is more complicated than black and white\) will not offer a definitive end to migrant smuggling\.

Despite that we’re looking forward to reading _the Global Study on the Smuggling of Migrants_ that _UNODC_ will publish during 2018\. Even though we may not agree on the suggested solutions since they all too often doesn’t ask the right questions: who will this really benefit?

[Aegean Boat Report](https://www.facebook.com/AegeanBoatReport/posts/324929701363474) provided more details about the different boats\. In one boat, 32 children were among the rescued\.

Later on Wednesday more boats arrived, [read the Aegean Boat report with an update\.](https://www.facebook.com/AegeanBoatReport/posts/325268877996223)
#### Bosnia

The situation remains as described in yesterday’s feature\. Volunteers on site reposted some of the info and added some photos and a video\. The sun was shining today\. A kitchen is also taking shape as we speak\.

#### Serbia

In February the NGO Praxis didn’t meet more than 125 people on a daily basis when they were out on rounds in Serbia\. They also counted 425 newly arrived people, of whom 279 were men, 49 women and 100 children\.

**The Workshop needs future funding**

NorthStar, in collaboration with [The Workshop: Belgrad](https://www.facebook.com/theworkshopbelgrade/?fref=mentions) e, have recently started a fundraiser in order to secure their activities for the next year\. Click [here](https://www.gofundme.com/educating-refugees-at-the-workshop) to help\. Watch the video to learn more about their daily educational program\.

**Italian journalist is still in jail**

The jailed photo\-journalist Mauro Donato is still detained, falsely accused of robbing and stabbing three refugees who have said that he wasn’t the perpetrator\. On the other hand, they said that they appreciated his job as a journalist to document the living standards and everyday life in the Serbian border town Sid\.

Donato will remain in jail until at least Friday, according to information received by AYS\.
#### Hungary

Victor Orban, Hungary’s far right Prime Minister, [has now implemented his toxic ideas not only in the public society and media](https://archive.li/1qEJv) , but also in the school books\. In the latest edition of the 8th grade history textbook the following is found on page 155:


> “It can be problematic,” the book concludes, “for different cultures to coexist\.” 




The book describes not only that Orban thinks refugees are a threat to the Hungarian society, it also encourages them to think likewise\.

This kind of xenophobic state propaganda is not something that belongs in Europe in 2018\. It is based on selfish and unfounded fear\.
#### France

Between the 5th of February and 5th of March, Paris d’Exil was able to shelter 15 additional unaccompanied minors waiting to appeal the decision to not be recognized as minors\. Around 50 other minors are hosted within its network\.

For those looking to host, Paris d’Exil organizes a meeting every Saturday at 17h at the café Fluctuat Nec Mergitur, place de la République\.

**Literally “destroying tents while providing food”**

[Last Friday we wrote](ays-daily-digest-23-03-2018-state-destroys-tents-while-providing-food-e58c01a2e321) about how the authorities are destroying tents while providing food\. An outrageous hypocrisy — people can eat, but not sleep\. Where is the logic in this treatment?

AYS can add that L’Auberge des Migrants said that these things are taking place at exactly the same time, as the dismantlement of the camp rue des Vérrotières took place at the same moment as the breakfast distribution\. The refugees were not informed and when they came back from breakfast were not able to get their personal belongings\.

And why was it so many refugees who didn’t go to the first state\-run distributions, people asked? This is a clear indicator\. People who’s trust in authorities already is low due to the circumstances many of them fled before coming to Europe, are once again screwed over\. It’s not strange that for many when they finally enter the country they want to claim asylum in, are skeptical towards the state, police, and procedures they have to go through\. A lot of people remain hidden instead of risking contact with the police\.


> This situation force people to choose between food and shelter\. Both are apparently too much to ask for\.

#### Sweden

Today in the Swedish parliament there was the first vote regarding the suggested new extended “high school law”, which would allow up to 9000 more young people to stay in the country\. But, unfortunately, the left wing party and its partners didn’t win\. Lagrådet, a group of lawyers connected to the parliament with influence but not a final say, said that the suggested law isn’t good\. What they based this on, we don’t know\. With the new law, the criticised and unreliable medical age exams would lose some power over young people lives\. They would no longer need to “prove” themselves to be under 18, in case the exam says different\. More people could finish high school in peace\.

[**Christina Höj Larsen**](https://www.facebook.com/christina.hoj.larsen?hc_ref=ARTCWdJylNKOUSjL7jsN5niU8phFyTzv4WQ3q9q8ubMrln2pJb8XWT9iISCAn2uUL7k&fref=nf) from the left wing party wrote this on her Facebook after the voting was done:


> We did not win the amnesty vote today\. But we won’t give up\. We will continue to insist on defending everybodys human worth\. Today, it is about single\-parent’s opportunity to stay, breathe out and build their life safely\. Tomorrow we can talk about some of us\. 





> We know that sometimes it takes time\. But we also know that we will win in the end\. Because we need each other\. 





> In today’s vote, twenty left\-wingers and a Liberal voted for amnesty\. A Social Democrat and another Liberal resigned\. 





This fall it will be general elections\. Hopefully, the human side will be able to declare themselves winners\. It’s a small country, but due to a big influx of refugees — a lot of people’s wellbeing depends on the outcome of the elections in September\.
