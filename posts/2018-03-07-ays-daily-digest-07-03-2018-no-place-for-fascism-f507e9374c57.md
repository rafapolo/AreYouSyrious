#### FEATURE

Members of two groups of Greek neo\-Nazis, both having connections with the far\-right party, Golden Dawn, were arrested today in a police crackdown across the country, DW [reports](http://www.dw.com/en/greek-neo-nazis-arrested-in-police-crackdown/a-42855743) \. The groups Combat 18 \(Hitler symbolics\) and Autonome Nationalists \(Independent Meandrian Nationalists\), suspected of many attacks on refugees and antifascists, were planning a major bomb attack, a police spokesperson said\. Police confiscated material that included 50kg of nitrous ammonia, butane canisters, petrol bombs, knives, clubs, hunting weapons, flags and other objects bearing extreme right imagery\.

Photos of arrests can be found [**here**](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lifo.gr%2Fnow%2Fgreece%2F183183%2Foi-neonazi-tis-organosis-combat-18-hellas-ston-eisaggelea-fotografies&h=ATMHgxeS0nbgGxIAhXNx2pP1T5vYLPnL-DmZLK663OSHvx8pR-9iMA7LaNEPmAMKVijgVQGqWMQwUoO8kkQOoKLp6O1Km4UNjk1hr_7n-sj7n4bmzw) \.

Among the arrested is a lawyer, who appears to be a former party leader, as well a founding member of the right wing advocacy group, DIESY, and also a former member of the National Council of “Nea Dexia”, meaning “New Right”, borderline reports [writes](https://borderlinereports.com/2018/03/07/former-new-right-party-leading-member-among-arrested-extreme-rightists/) , adding:


> if it is confirmed that a former National Council member of “New Right” was arrested for extreme right wing terrorism, this raises questions about what sort of relationship the extreme right has with legitimate right wing parties\. 




#### Chios City Council members leave room as a reaction to Golden Dawn presence at council meeting

Meanwhile, two members of Golden Dawn were present at a City Council meeting today in Chios\. One of them, John Flax, complained both about the fact that police blocked the access road to Karfas on the day of their party’s planned event and about the adoption of a resolution by the City Council condemning the presence of its parliamentary representatives, Politis Chios [reports](http://www.politischios.gr/aytodioikisi/binteo-adeiase-to-demotiko-sumboulio-episeme-parembase-tes-khruses-auges) \.

As a direct reaction during the intervention of Golden Dawn, Mark Skoufalos tacitly left the meeting\. His reaction was followed by almost all members of the City Council, symbolically showing their repudiation for Golden Dawn and what it stands for\.

The President of the Municipal Council, Yannis Georgiades, explained that he was present in the room as the representative of the institution\. In response, he refused to withdraw the resolution, pointing out that it reflects the unanimous position of the City Council\.

#### SYRIA
#### East Ghouta

“Hysterical” bombing, with banned chemical weapons \(Napalm, Phosphorus, Cluster Bombs, and now Chlorine\) occurred again today in East Ghouta\. SAMS facilities are receiving patients suffering from symptoms consistent with exposure to chlorine gas\. At least 14 children with these symptoms are being treated at just one of their facilities, they [reported](https://www.facebook.com/SyrianAmericanMedicalSociety/photos/a.258039294245879.57539.187820854601057/1638366382879823/?type=3) \.


> At least 50 people have been killed today\. People are dying on the streets because ambulances and the Syrian Civil Defense cannot access the injured due to the shelling\. Civilians are being killed and gravely injured by the hour — nowhere is safe, even hospitals and underground shelters\. If they don’t die immediately, the injured often succumb to their wounds because of lack of medical care\. Just a few days ago, surgical items and trauma kits were cruelly removed from an inter\-agency convoy heading into East Ghouta\. 





This is the eighth use of a chemical weapon in Syria in 2018, and the fourth in East Ghouta in the same time period\.

Nearly two weeks ago the UN Security Council passed a resolution that urged those involved in Syria’s conflict to allow humanitarian aid and medicine to reach nearly half a million desperate civilians trapped in East Ghouta\. So far, the resolution has been largely ignored by the Syrian government, HRW [writes](https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/03/07/un-security-council-should-protect-eastern-ghouta) \. About 38% of civilian casualties during 18 days of shelling in East Ghouta were killed after the resolution and during Putin’s truce, SOHR [reported](http://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=86316) \.

White Helmets [called for immediate action\.](https://www.facebook.com/1489609321340242/photos/a.1500284590272715.1073741829.1489609321340242/1842119066089264/?type=3&theater)

Rebels in Syria’s East Ghouta “refuse to leave” and have reiterated they will defend the area, saying a Russian\-proposed withdrawal was not a serious offer, Al Jazeera [reports](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/syria-army-intensifies-fight-rebels-eastern-ghouta-180307092826609.html) \.

#### LIBYA
#### UN wants to remove 8000 refugees from Libya

The UN High Commissioner for Refugees has so far removed 1,344 refugees qualified as vulnerable from Libya, with the goal of reaching 8,000 by the end of the year\. These refugees were re\-routed to third countries, namely Niger and Italy\. This group is only a fraction of the 48,000 registered refugees in Libya, abola [writes](https://www.abola.pt/Mundos/Noticias/Ver/719646) \.
#### TURKEY
#### Plan to establish refugee camps in Syria

The Turkish government announced it will set up camps for 170,000 displaced people within Syria ahead of an influx of refugees from the Syrian region of Afrin, InfoMigrants [reports](http://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/7937/turkey-plans-to-establish-refugee-camps-in-syria?ref=tw) \. A spokesman for Turkey’s foreign ministry, Hami Aksoy, said on Tuesday that new refugee camps would be established in nine different regions in Syria including Azaz, Elbil, Tugli, Teleffer, Naddah, Bardakh and Masad Rufi\.

230,000 Syrian refugees are living in camps on the Turkish side of the border, according to the Turkish government\. The majority of refugees in Turkey, numbering **more than 3 million** , are living outside the camps\.
#### GREECE
#### Amnesty International on Samos

Amnesty’s team was in Samos last week to assess the living conditions of people in camps on the island\. Their reports said that the camp was massively overcrowded and described it as a security and health nightmare\. [Amnesty says](http://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/7923/amnesty-international-puts-spotlight-on-samos?ref=tw_i) the refugee camp on the Greek island of Samos is “crawling with rats”\. After the visit, they have renewed calls for people in the overcrowded camps to be transferred to the Greek mainland\.

The police stations in the islands are being used as detention centers for those who have been refused asylum claims\. According to NGOs working with prisoners there, many men have been held in the police stations for months, in inappropriate places for long\-term detention\. One of them told Amnesty: “There is no natural light in this place; there are no mattresses or pillows\. People who are detained are going crazy if they are not already crazy\.”

Here are the latest official governmental statistics on arrivals to the Aegean islands:

#### Spanish firefighters accused of trafficking people in Lesvos

Manuel Blanco, Julio Latorre, and Enrique Rodriguez, three firefighters from Seville, Spain, who have helped out in multiple refugee rescue missions on the Greek island of Lesvos, could be facing 10 years in prison due to accusations of smuggling by the Greek government, Euronews [reports](http://www.euronews.com/amp/2018/03/06/three-spanish-firefighters-accused-of-trafficking-people-in-lesbos) \.

“If a person is drowning and you bring them ashore to try and save them, that can be seen as facilitating their entry,” Blanco said\. This, in his opinion, blurs the fine line between human trafficking and humanitarian aid\. He spoke to Euronews from Brussels, where he’s trying to gather support from Spanish MEPs ahead of the May 7 trial in Mitilini, Lesvos\.

In honor of International Women’s Day tomorrow, City Plaza hosted a release [event](https://www.facebook.com/events/738815169660989/permalink/739419196267253/) for “Plaza Girls’ Zine”\. Refugee ‘girls of City Plaza’ presented 7 small zines, as a result of their working group\.

#### FRANCE

Local authorities in Calais fulfilled the promise made by president Macron to provide food to refugees sleeping rough\. Yesterday, for the first time in 28 months, [**Refugee Community Kitchen**](https://www.facebook.com/refugeeCkitchen/?hc_ref=ARSW8Trh_b7NnypiloobpubeziSHig3NvDsSPn_PXU3QKxTFQo7n4TTCifhSaA6kJy4) didn’t provide food for these people\.

They posted [footage](https://www.facebook.com/refugeeCkitchen/videos/2087920247892001/) of the new government funded distribution point in a compound surrounded by fences crowned with razor wire\. “The wall of journalists waiting inside to film was most inappropriate and completely deaf to the peoples’ needs and safety\. The food consisted of beef and potatoes\. No fresh vegetables” they said, adding that hundreds of people refused to eat there, some for political reasons \(people won’t accept food until the government halts its violent evictions and confiscation of their belongings\) and others out of mistrust for authorities\.
