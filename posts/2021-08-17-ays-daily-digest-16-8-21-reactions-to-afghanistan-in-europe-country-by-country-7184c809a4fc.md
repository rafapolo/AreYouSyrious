News agencies and social media platforms have been blowing up over the past few days with updates, takes, photos, personal reflections and petitions surrounding the developments in Afghanistan\. For those struggling to keep up with the crazy 24\-hour news cycle, Are You Syrious has made an effort to consolidate the different reactions of European countries in the wake of the Taliban takeover\. We‚Äôve also compiled a list of what we hope are helpful resources and petitions for those who want to show their support and put pressure on their governments to take in those fleeing the country\. By the time this digest is published, some of this information may have changed, but we will continue to post updates and try our best to find the best and most accurate information out there\. Here goes\.
#### RESOURCES & PETITIONS
- Here is a list of Google Forms organized by Truman National Security Project, No One Left Behind, Human Rights First, and other US\-based nonprofits on how to help Afghans get out of the country: [Passport holder evacuation form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc5hi-em8I7XBf6Sgr0BXNNScrNK8p6KwW6GsP9OIjm9r3M6Q/viewform?fbclid=IwAR2FBFiW9vqijaCzM67YfUzAK3F7XOP94WLT04TqVbCZfNucsk-glwOhetk) ; [Pledges to support Afghan airlift](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfitym3vRQKDjEMNaK3j5D7SCYVbIhBruIMClUaK0DkP9uO-g/viewform?fbclid=IwAR2pwIS36zUKMmr79hO8IGqBDeZ0cWP7xZ90jVNLDTZAK021me-oN5MzuZA) ; [Information on how to delete your digital history](https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/sites/default/files/How%20to%20delete%20your%20history_updated.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2h0twwVBrYbAw2SFpvQhy1rg8LMM7Ls8ndG7U_pDCfpJ4uu2EpsX7MUnM) \.

- Here is a list of organizations you can donate to on the ground in Afghanistan\. Some are local associations, some are international\. [Rukhshana media](https://chuffed.org/project/reporting-on-issues-that-affect-afghan-women-is-expensive-rukhshana-media-needs-your-help?fbclid=IwAR23uag2Ymd2g-BLQhFqh3vcBV2M9BBCadKCanG_wGc6XIC6msjGLd6jOxs) \(Afghan female journalists\); [orphanages in Kabul](https://enabledchildren.org/?fbclid=IwAR3xJHwxcJCZUf_xJafmNKJo8QMWCrpLa44QHuV4aUE7JLkgzB7v1Tth5tg) working with children with disabilities; [Women for women](https://support.womenforwomen.org/donate/afghanistan-emergency-2x-match?fbclid=IwAR16QID6yiWi3WbiROC8oDKxFPmRkY6kFGH2wbf3ViB0tNkbFe7R440fZy8) \(NGO supporting women affected by war with a team in Kabul\); [medical association](https://en.emergency.it/donate/?fbclid=IwAR1sIG_eKoY4D1SWHLV3JTNfBI9TE4ZSkrU2ZXGh7BMWSkGCY3ateOlWbHc) with teams in Afghanistan since 1999\.

And now, we‚Äôll go country by country for their reactions to the news of the Taliban takeover\. Before that, it‚Äôs worth checking out this article from the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/16/expected-afghan-influx-reopens-divisions-over-refugees-europe?fbclid=IwAR1SKLCFU3QL4DI-hej6nKXbvHMk3aqiZRYisjdTak_Bqz0rfgrAckEYnZI) about how the fall of Kabul is set to ‚Äúreopen divisions over immigration in European countries‚Äù\. In an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council, UN chief Antonio Guterres ‚Äúurge\[d\] all countries to receive Afghan refugees, and refrain for any deportations\.‚Äù
#### GERMANY: ‚ÄúDo Not Repeat the 2015 Mistake‚Äù

Armin Laschet, a candidate for chancellor of Germany, [spoke out](https://www.rnd.de/politik/afghanistan-fluechtlinge-laschet-lehnt-zusage-fuer-aufnahme-ab-7CSIFUACUOJ3RISLT7JH7Q3CTU.html?fbclid=IwAR0f-f-sS__Wq87pqJ8mRsSVqXu6t-yPSBfcThU93I4ER2DbMM1V4ND2KQc) against proposals to take Afghan refugees, saying that the ‚Äúmistake‚Äù of 2015, when Germany took in nearly a million refugees, could not be repeated\.

‚ÄúI believe that we shouldn‚Äôt send out the signal now that Germany can virtually take in everyone who is now in need,‚Äù the CDU chairman said in Berlin on Monday\.
#### AUSTRIA: Proposal to Set Up Deportation Centers

Austria, which wants to continue deporting people to Afghanistan, [has now said](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/austria-calls-deportation-centres-host-afghans-near-afghanistan-2021-08-16/?fbclid=IwAR0NXbgEgiNaC5TsUEUL3dAZ8oB2xYz0CR8sndfOsjYcsaBqtRtHanHUlV4) it plans to open up deportation centers in nearby countries\.

‚ÄúIf deportations are no longer possible because of the restrictions imposed on us by the European Convention on Human Rights, alternatives must be considered,‚Äù Austrian Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said in a joint statement\.

This, of course, as one commentator pointed out, flies in the face of both international and EU law:

#### FRANCE: We Must Protect Ourselves Against ‚ÄúIrregular Migratory Flows‚Äù

[Macron himself](https://twitter.com/GuillaumeDaret/status/1427331609913708548?fbclid=IwAR3YxCOAEhKZt_GPnuRoVqgTSQzfrL1Pr8kdrdpv4_7AOYx1ZnXG07_oOSo) :

‚ÄúWe must anticipate and protect ourselves against significant irregular migratory flows that would endanger those who use them, and feed trafficking of all kinds\.‚Äù

#### BELGIUM: No Forced Repatriations

Belgium‚Äôs federal secretary of state [has made it clear](https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2021/08/16/forced-repatriations-of-failed-afghan-asylum-seekers-off-the-age/?fbclid=IwAR3Iv0ccdRXJyrmS0tDptOL79yC7rHmP8m7jsLnexYdw5PaQay6k48AJkdc) that the country will not participate in forced repatriations of Afghan nationals\.

‚ÄúWhen each case is assessed individually, today it is clear that the situation in Afghanistan is terrible and that you can‚Äôt decently sent someone back to somewhere where he or she would end up in a region where they don‚Äôt feel safe‚Äù, Sammy Mahdi told media\.
#### DENMARK: Reviewing Asylum Rejections to Avoid Deportation

Somewhat surprisingly, Denmark, which has come under fire in recent months for its plan to deport recognized refugees back to Syria, [now says](https://fln.dk/da/Nyheder/Nyhedsarkiv/2021/16082021?fbclid=IwAR2EiH5JYHMfvlP6eSLrD-KriBH-q5iYXZj0dT1Nzh4yVk0PU4B1K8R0PvI) it is suspending asylum applications to devote its attention to reviewing rejections of Afghans who may be at risk of deportation\.
#### ICELAND: Afghan Urges Adopted Country to Step Up

In Iceland, one Afghan man who came to the country as a refugee in 2018 is now [urging his adopted country](https://grapevine.is/news/2021/08/16/refugee-urges-iceland-to-save-afghan-people/?fbclid=IwAR2DL_kGYL9M-YwMqycwtB6NkOl1p6LglZ6gfNWpU38_ScEJBtzoJWnhvLU) to take in more refugees from his homeland\.

‚ÄúIf Iceland can receive even just 20 families, then it is possible to secure a future for those people,‚Äù 20 year old Sayed Khanoghli said\.
#### HUNGARY: Won‚Äôt Take Afghans, Pay for US‚Äô Mistakes

Hungary [put it bluntly](https://hungarytoday.hu/hungary-afghanistan-migrants-afghan-refugees/) : it won‚Äôt pay for the US‚Äô mistakes, so no, it won‚Äôt take in any refugees\.
#### GREECE: Won‚Äôt Be a ‚ÄúGateway‚Äù For a ‚ÄúNew Wave‚Äù

Confusing messages out of Greece: although the country signed a letter in favor of safe passage, now the migration minister says he won‚Äôt allow the country to become a gateway for a ‚Äúnew wave‚Äù of migration\.

> > Some very contradictory statements coming from Greece concerning refugees from Afghanistan. Having signed a letter demanding "safe passage," for those wanting to leave Afghanistan the Greek migration minister says the country will not become a "gateway." [ekathimerini.com/news/1166292/g‚Ä¶](https://www.ekathimerini.com/news/1166292/greece-among-66-countries-demanding-safe-passage-out-of-afghanistan/)

#### PORTUGAL: We Will Accept Refugees

Portugal has [stepped up to the plate](https://www.theportugalnews.com/news/2021-08-16/portugal-will-accept-afghan-refugees/61757?fbclid=IwAR2AUQYO8ZHrRrkKW3pxXptbJfwchL7Dk-81hvrbJhCrvKTA8tFqWo7VLlY) and said it will accept refugees from Afghanistan\.

‚ÄúOur immediate objective is to support, create conditions so that the officials who worked for NATO, or the EU, or with the United Nations can leave the country safely and, in this matter, Portugal will obviously participate in a collective effort that is now taking place,‚Äù said the country‚Äôs defense minister\.

There are some 243 Afghans and their families who worked with Portuguese forces who will need to leave the country\.
#### REFLECTIONS

We‚Äôre sharing here some links to reflections of those who have worked on the ground with Afghan refugees for years\. Activists in France and Slovenia shared personal stories of witnessing late night evictions and the aftermaths of pushbacks of Afghans\. Here is [Utopia 56](http://www.utopia56.com/fr/actualite/pour-demandeurs-dasile-dafghanistan-dailleurs-laccueil-deplorable-france-doit-changer?fbclid=IwAR3rDW_eet9KtNmjckEe2M1MLj91Stqnucch64cVSh4FNN1XoNoPLP3GqTc) and [Ambasada Rog](https://www.facebook.com/ambasadarog/posts/1532707653730532) \.

We‚Äôll just drop here that according to Open Democracy, **in 2021 alone** , the UK rejected [at least 76 asylum requests](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/uk-government-rejected-more-32000-afghan-asylum-seekers/?fbclid=IwAR2EiH5JYHMfvlP6eSLrD-KriBH-q5iYXZj0dT1Nzh4yVk0PU4B1K8R0PvI) from Afghans, including ten women and a girl\. In total, the UK has rejected more than 32,000 Afghans‚Äô appeals for asylum\.
### SEA
#### Rescues by MSF‚Äôs Geo Barents

MSF reported on Twitter it has rescued two separate groups within 24 hours in the Central Med\. The [first rescue](https://twitter.com/MSF_Sea/status/1427037674414690306) was 189 people in total, and the [second](https://twitter.com/MSF_Sea/status/1427318600826822661) , on Monday afternoon, was of 46 people\.

### GREECE
