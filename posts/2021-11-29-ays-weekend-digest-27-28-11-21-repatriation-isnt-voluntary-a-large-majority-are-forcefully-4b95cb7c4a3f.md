#### FEATURE — Held in terrible conditions in Poland, while others are being forcefully deported from Belarus

Following the many “voluntary returns” from **Belarus** to Iraq, more and more reports are coming in, documenting forceful returns to the Kurdish region in Iraq\. According to the [Kurdistan Watch](https://twitter.com/KurdistanWatch) , a considerable amount of people have testified that they have been arrested by the Belarusian police and are forced to return\.

At the same time, on the other side of the border, in **Poland** , several hundred people protested and attempted to get out of the centre\.

In connection with what is happening in Wędrzyn, Grupa Graica appealed for the improvement of procedures, and above all to respect the basic rights of people in detention:


> For many weeks we have been receiving information from them about inhumane conditions in the resort\. The most commonly reported problems are: 




- Overpopulation\. In August 2021 MSWiA reduced the minimum area per person in centres from 4 to 2 square meters\. The current standard is even lower than the one in Polish prisons\.
- Lack of adequate medical and psychological care\.
- Limiting fundamental rights to information conveyed in a language understandable for migrants and migrants\.
- Limited internet access, which prevents contact with close ones and lawyers\.
- Stress and additional trauma caused with the sounds of gunshots and explosions\. TSOC in Hungary is located in Bowiem on the territory of an active military station\. The detention persons come from countries filled with armed conflicts, and their settlement in such a place results in continuing trauma\.
- Long wait for meals\. Those in the centre have to wait in front of the canteen, in the cold, often in the rain\. It’s worth remembering that many people do not have suitable shoes or warm clothes for this time of year\.
- No privacy\. Migrants sleep on the floor racks in crowded rooms, where there is no furnishings except for table and chairs\. In these rooms there is also a “toilet corner” — a place separated from the rest of the room with a meter high wall\.


[Read here](https://www.facebook.com/grupagranica/posts/302893111639291) what else they have to say about this\.

At the infamous Wędrzyn centre, there are about 600 people, more than half of them are from Iraq\. This centre was mentioned in the [report](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbip.brpo.gov.pl%2Fpl%2Fkmpt%2Fwizytacja-kmpt-w-strzezonym-osrodku-dla-cudzoziemcow-w-krosnie-odrzanskim-oraz-tymczasowym%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2lx8egh_A8ld4Cu7wuAdpZ1LnylM9N_tPv1AfDX3CHwOaTytjU9eeFu6M&h=AT3pcH2hLZgVf7QCPlWMW6Ln9Af5OCeKFt_inT1AftTRh-xn0ND6MCEIzjTjQWRkvJ3Rxpkhd7lo4AogEW0hkbtlTIUlXWtCSXs3VUky3Sx5tbzcu44wHSmjRo7acUlEYw&__tn__=-UK-R&c[0]=AT3YvblD316KZhnR-k2MQG-1K9g3AAuDBOdPRNEVKCnbGNZ2VNRj6w3MZvCUS4NX_D_fQy7C9VhJODF1bAFZ-dygsICRyy-X7a4btubo_XGeDW2XyrdJ2XXuDQ9mYALym5IVs2DkNAdLii6AQPvqZZaHrPJzuh9W0InmoXPovHlRTQ) of the National Mechanism for the Prevention of Torture at the Commissioner for Human Rights\. “The residential buildings resemble prisons\. They are surrounded by barbed wire”\. They report people placed there are very stressed by the sounds of shots and explosions, which were related to armed conflicts, as the Ombudsman’s office noted, adding that “such conditions may deepen the trauma”\.


> They sleep on two\-story bunks, the rooms lack any furniture other than tables and stools\. There are no covers in the windows of the living rooms, so the men covered the windows with toilet paper\. The barracks are in disorder, and the cleanliness of the sanitary facilities also raises concerns\. Waste and cigarette butts are visible in corridors and other common areas\. Foreigners store clothes on the floor or in plastic bags\. 




#### GREECE
### No such a thing as “dignified reception” in camps set out by the EU

Organised movements, groups, initiatives and people in general have multiple times demonstrated the many alternatives that are plausible ways of preventing concentration camp\-like\-facilities and more suffering that comes along\. However, that does not fit someone’s agenda\. 
RSA reminds of one such example:

During the opening of the new facilities on the islands of Kos and Leros, many bizarre things have been said, central among them being the statement of the Vice\-President of the European Commission that “these structures reflect our values and European ways of life\.”

The sequence of cynicism and bizarre statements doesn’t end there\. Fixating his eyes on the “serious dangers” in the text, the Greek Migration Minister retweeted the Pope’s statement that we are pretty sure went against all he and his policies stand for, leaving many puzzled\.

The Pope, in fact, also posted this: “I feel sorrow thinking about those who died crossing the English Channel, those on the borders of Belarus, many of whom are children, those who drown in the Mediterranean, those who are repatriated to North Africa and forced into servitude\.”

Another one came from the Prime Minister, in an interview for the Washington Post: “No country has a right to weaponize migrants\. \. \. We won’t let people come in as they please\. This is my duty towards my citizens, and I’m also doing the job on behalf of Europe because the borders of Greece are also the borders of Europe\.”

#### FRANCE
### Frontex to fly over the misery

It is announced that a Frontex aircraft will be deployed over the Channel from 1 December\. This Sunday the minister of Interior of France announced it at the end of a ‘crisis meeting’ with his European partners following the death of 27 \(more\) people trying to cross the Channel\. As the deployment of Frontex over the Channel was announced, many reactions were sparked, one of them coming from our fellow activists from Utopia: “ \(…\) an armed militia funded by the EU and accused of crimes against humanity in the Mediterranean\. A new system of violence, without ever talking about asylum, accommodation and legal and safe channels \(…\)”


> _Since 2017, aerial surveillance has become central to EU attempts to identify, deter and return intercepted migrants to Libya\. As a result, struggles between the EU and civil society rescue actors have also shifted from the seas to the skies\._ 




At the same time, in Paris, a solidarity gathering voiced people’s concern for more decent housing for people on the move:

Very poor conditions are reported in places where people who arrived to Tenerife have to stay, according to the reports of the local support group:

#### POLAND
### Grupa Granica’s statement in relation to the attack by soldiers of the Territorial Defence Forces on their volunteer and translator Jakub Sypiański


> On 26 November at night Jakub Sypiański, an Arabic translator and volunteer with the Border Assistance Group who has been helping people in need at the border for many weeks, was attacked near Michałowo by armed and uniformed men\. As it later turned out, these were soldiers from the Territorial Defence Forces \(WOT\) \. The aggressors tried to forcefully drag Jakub out of the vehicle\. They suggested that he was a people smuggler\. They behaved aggressively and vulgarly\. They took his car keys and searched the boot\. Fortunately, Jakub was not severely beaten\. Both the Border Guard and the Police present at the scene refused to accept the report of a crime\.

A dead body of a man was found by the Belarusian forces in the border area\. Belarus reportedly accused Lithuania of leaving the body\. There is a lot of evidence that the regime beats the people on the move \(as well as opponents\) and doesn’t let them leave the camps\.

#### DENMARK

A new law in Denmark, which could ultimately end the integration of refugees on Danish territory, offers important lessons about contemporary externalisation policies and the political motives behind them\.
