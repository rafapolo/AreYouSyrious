“The sea has become a cemetery, and these islands are the tombstones“\. Moving words shared by members of the local community on Malta, in support to the many who’s lives continue to be lost at the hands of a cold, uncaring migration policy\. — [LIFELINE](https://www.facebook.com/seenotrettung/?tn-str=k%2AF&hc_location=group_dialog)
#### FEATURE

Recently, we have been receiving a lot of calls for help in finding missing relatives and friends who were on the move and whose contact got lost in the western Balkans\. A worried cousin recently updated the situation of their relative saying they had found out that the Turkish mafia which is operating in the area between Slovenia and Bosnia has allegedly abducted their relative, along with other people, taking them away, asking for ransom\. It is difficult to establish a way to know the exact number of people who have lost their lives in the woods and rivers, trying to cross them\.
In addition to this, people are constantly reporting pushbacks and ill treatment by officials in the region\. The area between Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia seems to have become a black hole for refugees and migrants, who are not allowed to travel legally and in a legitimate way or to apply for international protection, though the Croatian MOI representatives, like an automated machine, keep repeating this is possible, even stating at conferences that Croatia supports only legal migration and that asking for international protection is possible at the Croatian borders\. By now, everyone knows it is not so, but seemingly rooted in the law, geographically in a tricky position, the Croatian police has so far answered very few of the many critiques coming their way\.

Unlike them, their Slovenian counterparts seem to follow what is being reported and written about them, and they have even reacted to a report of police abuse and \(chain\) pushbacks that the Border Violence Monitoring Team [documented](https://www.borderviolence.eu/violence-reports/august-21-2018-1600-caught-and-attacked-by-the-police-in-the-inner-slovenian-land-in-a-forest-by-the-town-crnomelj-viz-map-below/) \.

The police _totally reject the claims made, as it has been established that the events described cannot be placed in our area\._ They reject any possibility of having taken part in unlawful procedures, and — of course — repeat that:

_No irregularities and no unlawful or inappropriate police conduct were identified in procedures with foreigners\. Police officers strictly respect their rights and all human rights\. All foreigners are given humanitarian aid \(food, clothing, etc\. \) and, if appropriate, medical care\. If they are seeking asylum, they can file an application for international protection\._

\(…\) _information was inaccurate — the individuals making the allegations had either not been processed by our police officers at all or they were unable to provide the date of procedure or the place where they had crossed the border or say the police of which country brutalised them\._

In their [**answer to the Police**](https://www.borderviolence.eu/a-letter-from-the-slovenian-police/) that you should definitely read, the team argues that the police should have been able to properly investigate and find the evidence and traces of these people being processed by the Slovenian police, as the case documents provided more than enough material and information for officials, with all the access the every type of data, to do so\. They also said:


> _A quick look into the database revealed some more cases in which, allegedly, the Slovenian police was involved in unlawful behaviour\. In 2018 alone there are **28 cases of push\-backs involving Slovenian police officers** \. We have collected these reports for you below\. In 22 of the cases, requests for asylum were deliberately ignored\. In seven cases, the persons seeking asylum reported they had been physically abused by Slovenian police officers\. Seven cases involved minors\. Most of the interviewees claim to have been body\-searched, some to have been stripped of their clothes\. Many were taken to a police station were they had to sign documents they did not understand, for only rarely was a translator provided\._ 





> _We would like to use this opportunity to ask the Slovenian police for their position regarding this information\. We assume it to be in your own interest that all of these cases are looked into, so that — should it turn out that unlawful push\-backs are indeed not something entirely made up — appropriate measures can be taken to prevent them from happening in the future\._ 





> _All of the cases below are so\-called chain push\-backs\. That means that Slovenian police officers deport people on the move to the border with Croatia, where they are transferred to the Croatian police who then continue to deport them to Bosnia or Serbia\._

### Flu among refugees and migrants in Velika Kladuša

A doctor working in the area mentioned has published a warning text explaining the severe medical situation that hundreds of refugees are currently in\. So far, this is the only source we have found reporting a flu epidemic among the people in Velika Kladuša\. Here is the entire text:


> _Today, in only a couple of hours, 53 refugees and migrants were seeking help from the volunteer medical team \(VMT\) of S\.O\.S\. Ljuta Krajina in Velika Kladuša\. Thirty of them needed help for different injuries and skin conditions, while 23 refugees and migrants came with symptoms of flu\. Medical volunteers of S\.O\.S\. started reporting about a flu epidemic from last Friday \(23\.11\. \) when the first ten refugees and migrants came to them with symptoms of flu\. Every day since Friday, about ten new patients visited our medical volunteer with flu symptoms, but today the number of new flu\-infected patients increased to 23\. No need to say that most of the flu\-infected patients came from the makeshift camp of Trnovi \(not winterized\) where they sleep on the ground in a wetland covered often only with polyvinyl\. Also, no need to say that you will not find information on the epidemic in the reports about healthcare of refugees and migrants composed by UN agencies\. Partly the reason for this silence is the non\-existence of a proper humanitarian or regular health service for refugees and migrants in BiH \(so the documentation and information are generally missing\), partly the reason lies in the coverup style of reporting practicing by UN agencies in BiH\. Until now not one of the epidemics that occurred in Velika Kladuša camps were reported in public, including a very serious epidemic of gastroenteritis that occurred this August when 2/3 of the Trnovi camp \(approximately about 300 people\) were suffering from vomiting and diarrhea \(many of them went to the toilet more than 20 times per day\) but this dramatic medical event did not find its place in any official report\. \(photography: S\.O\.S\. volunteers in medical action in Talakić street of Velika Kladuša, BiH\)_

#### CROATIA

Similar to other countries, like Germany, the Croatian practice with asylum seekers, mostly those from Maghreb, now includes sending those who had received a negative decision by the Court after the first appeal to the detention centre in Ježevo throughout the duration of the decision procedure\. This is a recent trend that probably aims at controlling the movement of asylum seekers during the process\.

> Refugees in Paris are in desperate need of our help this winter\. There are currently around 1500 refugees on the streets of Paris, including some families and many minors\. There is no refugee ‘camp’ in Paris, instead, people are scattered around the city, sleeping under bridges, in parks or on the pavement\. There are simple standpipes in the street to provide water but few places to shower or wash clothes\.

### Officials to send the 12 saved people back to the country that enables their suffering

An executive in the case of the rescued people on board of Nuestra Madre de Loreto is “negotiating” with the Libyan authorities “the landing” of a total of 12 migrants rescued by the fishery of Santa Pola \(Alicante\), among whom are two minors, according to the government delegate in the Valencian Community\. Folowing that decision, they should “disembark in a Libyan safe harbor, which is the maritime rescue zone that corresponds to the area where these immigrants were rescued” \. The country, however, is not considered a safe harbor [because of the numerous documented abuses against the migrant population](https://www.eldiario.es/desalambre/Libia-noche-violaban-delante-matar_0_789171121.html) in the country\.

[Proactiva Open Arms](https://www.facebook.com/proactivaservice/?tn-str=k%2AF&hc_location=group_dialog) recalls how unsafe Libya is and again draws attention to the double standards European countries continue having when it comes to human rights and safety\.


![“ Yes, if you are marine, fisherman or on board of a vessel, you can go to the country where diplomats were evacuated even to the Italian Ambassador\. To which secure port will they be sending Nuestra Madre de Loreto?”](assets/df87a8d965ac/1*dO3zZ5iro4HKhcnDQM32_Q.jpeg)

#### GERMANY
### Fear of night deportations in German ‘anchor centres’


> “We stay awake until three o’clock or even until five o’clock, we cannot sleep, we whisper together\. \.We are all depressed, we all have mental stress and we are thinking about how we are going to continue\.” — _23\-year\-old man from Afghanistan staying inn one of the ‘anchor centres’ in Bavaria_ 





Following an order of the Bavarian State Government, what used to be ‘transit centres’ are now called “anchor centres”\. Anchor stands for “Arrival, Decision and Repatriation”\. This should be done without unnecessary bureaucracy and as quickly and effectively as possible; the decision\-makers are personally present in the centers as well: the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees \(Bamf\), the Administrative Court, the Return Advisory Service and the Employment Agency\. Everything should be done in one go\. Since August this year, every newly arrived refugee in Bavaria has been lodged in one of the seven ‘anchor centres’ in Bavaria\. This represents the implementation of what the Federal Interior Minister has in mind for all of Germany\. The maximum length of stay is six, for certain groups up to 24 months\. Since the beginning of August there has also been an ‘anchor center’ in Saxony, since the end of September also one in the federal state of Saarland, media [report](http://taz.de/Ankerzentren-in-Bayern/!5548527/?fbclid=IwAR3342jpHJd7tpD76G1ghw8kU84wo81oHBie51gKE-QYSOe2-QPAtmcjD5M) \.

Although the camp is not a prison, it is a closed\-off place: no one is allowed to enter except for the authorities and other organisations, such as Caritas Social Counseling\. Relatives or friends of those in the anchor center wishing to visit them will be rejected\.


> In recent months, the provision of counseling for refugee accommodation has expanded, but critical organizations are being denied access\. — _Jana Weidhaase, Bavarian Refugee Council, officially banned from the centre_ 




### Rewarding ‘voluntary’ returns

Covered housing costs of refugees in their home country for twelve months if they leave before the end of the year\!
 — this is the deal the German Ministry is proposing in the wave of forcing through the international community’s idea number one: [Assisted Voluntary Return and Reintegration](https://www.iom.int/assisted-voluntary-return-and-reintegration) \.


> “Your country\. Your future\. Now\!“ 




— This is written in capital letters on posters\. Below, hidden in an email address: “Voluntary return”\. The Ministry of Interior has translated the slogan into several languages, including Arabic and Russian\. The poster series currently ‘decorates’ the walls of stations in several German cities\. 
[Reportedly](https://taz.de/!5553085/?fbclid=IwAR1SWuhEa7QR2G4sk0ZLV2_XQLlY8W68W8dv9J7TUrJ_zfWKORa_J0h0pM4) , half a million euros in tax money has been spent on this promotional activity\.

The campaign has already received a lot of critiques\.

#### UK

In two weeks, 15 people in Britain could be sentenced to life imprisonment for non\-violent civil disobedience\. They tried to prevent a deportation\.


> “Such a penalty is absurd and shows that the rule of law is no longer separated from the political agenda\. An example is to be made to prevent others from similar non\-violent measures to defend human rights\. We admire the courage of these people“ — [_Sea\-Watch_](https://www.facebook.com/seawatchprojekt/?tn-str=k%2AF&hc_location=group_dialog)
