#### **Feature: The march for dignity wins in Venice**

As reported in the last two digests \( [15/11](https://medium.com/@AreYouSyrious/ays-daily-digest-15-11-2017-2-years-of-eu-achievements-4833322e7505?source=user_profile---------2----------------) , [16/11](ays-daily-digest-16-11-17-eu-defending-an-outrage-to-the-conscience-of-humanity-3c178b8d9fc4) \), and widely covered by [Progetto Melting Pot Europa](http://www.meltingpot.org/) , refugees hosted in the notorious reception centre in Cona \(in the Veneto region, north\-eastern Italy\) started marching on Tuesday to reach Venice\.

The march was organised by the same refugees, protesting about the condition of the centre and demanding its closure and the transfer of all the inhabitants to other centres\.

After a first meeting with the Prefect on Wednesday, and two intense days last night they were hosted in the parishes of the area\.


[![Melting Pot Europa]( "Melting Pot Europa")](https://www.facebook.com/meltingpoteuropa/posts/1698417900189930)


Today their demands were met: they have all been transferred in groups of thirty people to different centres in the region, and 67 of them will stay in the area of Venice\.

The march for dignity — as it was named — was the first crack in the system of Italian reception _mega\-centres_ , which have been plagued by abuses and mismanagement\.

**Syria**
#### Civilian casualties in Syria

There have been many attacks on civilians in the last days\. [Syrian Network for Human Rights](http://sn4hr.org/blog/2017/11/18/snhr-documented-moment-friday-november-17-2017-killing-15-civilians/) reports that 15 people — 3 children, 1 woman, and 11 men were killed today by Syrian/Russian Alliance forces\. This follows the death of at least 43 people in Atareb Market in Aleppo on Monday\. The [Violations Documentation Centre in Syria](http://vdc-sy.net/market-massacre-is-a-war-crime-syrian-civil-society/) supports the call for further investigation by the international community\.

_Syrian civil society representatives are calling for:_

_1\.A UN\-led investigation of the Arateb market massacre, including the identification of the perpetrators of the attack;_

_2\.Immediate, continuous access by international, independent monitors to all de\-escalation zones, to ensure civilians are adequately protected;_

_3\.The UN and Member States to break the sieges across Syria and deliver cross\-line assistance as needed;_

_4\.Accountability for war crimes and crimes against humanity, including through a Special Tribunal for Syria supported by the General Assembly\._

Of those who have died in attacks in Douma, in the countryside near Damascus, 3 were volunteers with Support Syria Civil Defence\. Some other members of their team were injured\. Their jobs are particularly dangerous as they save those that are injured by air strikes and bombs\.

[Help Refugees](https://web.facebook.com/HelpRefugeesUK/posts/521866794840665?hc_location=ufi) , who sent 12 ambulances to search and rescue volunteers in Syria, have been asked by one of the Syria Civil Defence volunteers to raise awareness of the situation with EU governments and members of European Parliament\.

_Call for the international community to stop letting this continue\! Please find your MEP and take action here: [http://www\.europarl\.europa\.eu/meps/en/map\.html](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/map.html)_

**Italy**
#### **Deportations in Italy**

On Wednesday, the Interior minister Marco Minniti [released data](http://www.camera.it/leg17/410?idSeduta=0886&tipo=stenografico#sed0886.stenografico.tit00060.sub00080) about deportations during 2017, while praising the efficiency of Italian policies\. From the beginning of 2017, 39,634 irregular migrants have been identified \( \+15% compared to the same period in 2016\) and 17,405 have been forced to leave the country \( \+14% compared to 2016\) \. Of these 6\.777 were repatriated or re\-admitted to their country of origin\.

The number of decrees of accompanied expulsions rose to 93 \( \+40%\), connected to anti\-terrorism and national security provisions\.


> “An effective repatriation policy can’t disregard an international activity, aimed at the establishment of deals and operative protocols with the countries of origin and passage of migrants\. Italy and the European Union have signed deals with more than 20 countries for repatriation purposes\. Moreover, technical agreements for the contrast of irregular migration have been established with third countries: Algeria, Gambia, Ghana, Gibuti, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal and Sudan, and specific initiatives have been taken with Libya, Tunisia, Egypt and Gambia\. At an experimental level, an agreement with Bangladesh has been established in 2017” _\(Minister M\. Minniti\)_ 





Meanwhile, the landings on southern coasts show a decrease since last year \(114,606 from the beginning of 2017, \-31\.47%\) \.
#### **Austrian delegation visit Pordenone**

An Austrian delegation from Bauren Helfen Bauern came today to visit refugees in Pordenone\. While the local administration claims not to have enough funding for a dormitory, they spent 90,000 € for Christmas decorations for the town centre\.

**Spain**

[German media](http://m.dw.com/en/melilla-no-asylum-for-black-men/a-41404179) have written an exposé about the institutional racism suffered by refugees from central and southern African countries when entering Melilla, a Spanish enclave in Northern Africa, and the first point of entry for many on their journey Europe\. Their asylum claims are less likely to be accepted and as a result less people apply for protection leaving them at risk as they have to hide in the surrounding countryside\.

> It doesn’t matter what makes us run away\.

>  We have to escape, right now, without taking anything away from what was our life until then, no matter where\.
 

>  The Walls: those borders that Europe keeps building in defiance of the same values it prides itself on\. The same values on which it lectures other countries \(and on which it goes to war\) \. 





> The walls reveal their cost in human lives: they are a criminal and deadly attitude that stops humans from finding safety\. 






> The closure of borders is likely to kill as many as the disasters that have forced people to flee\. 





> On the other side of these walls, fortresses are erected whether by vox populi or current policies and entire families live between the hammer and the anvil: escape and live as an outcast or stay and risk death\. 




#### **Protest against Libyan embassy in Paris Tomorrow**

The [Collectif contre l’Esclavage et les Camps de Concentration En Libye](https://web.facebook.com/ceccl/) \(CECCL, Collective Against Slavery and Concetration Camps in Libya launched a protest against the Libyan Embassy for tomorrow Saturday 18th November, at 14\.00 h\.


> By financing Libya to stop the emigration of young Africans, U\.E\. is complicit in crimes against humanity\. 





> By its permanent silence, the U\.A is an accomplice of this crime against humanity\. 





> We call everyone to join the mobilization this Saturday 18 November\. 





> **Libyan Embassy, 6–8 rue Chasseloup\-Laubat, 75015 Paris**

Riot police, horses and arrest vans arrived to break down the fence\. The last people were dragged out of their home by force and at least one person has been arrested\. The building is owned by Arq, ‘experts’ in supporting traumatised refugees\. Some of the people they made homeless today have been receiving support from the organisations Arq work with\. This is the 29th home from which the residents have been evicted\.

As we write they are still looking for a place to sleep and only have a few belongings with them\.
