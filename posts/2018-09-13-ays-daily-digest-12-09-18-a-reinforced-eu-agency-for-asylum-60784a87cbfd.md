### The EU Commission proposes a reinforced EU Agency for Asylum

The EU Commission today proposed a reinforced EU Agency for Asylum\. “ Its staff will be available to provide operational and technical assistance throughout the asylum procedure as well as during the procedure under the Dublin Regulation”, the European Asylum Support Office \(EASO\) said on Twitter\. More details can be found in a [press release](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-5712_en.htm) of the Commission and a [Question & Answers](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-18-5714_en.htm) form\. It also includes proposals to:
- strengthen the EU Border Guard
- develop the European Asylum Agency
- accelerate the return of rejected migrants
- open legal pathways

It seems that the Commission wants to push this topic and establish the new agency quickly\. In a [letter](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/soteu2018-letter-of-intent_en.pdf) to Antonio Tajani, president of the European Parliament and Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz \(Austria holds the EU presidency until the end of the year\), Jean Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, suggested making this topic a priority one and stated ten priority points\. “We cannot continue to find ad\-hoc solutions each time a new ship arrives\. Temporary solidarity is not good enough\. We need lasting solidarity — today and forever more,” Juncker said\.

Until a solution can be found for them, total deterrence policies simply aim at pushing the problem back where both data and Europe’s attention span dramatically decline. https://t.co/UrxdI9NwLN

Steve Peers, professor of EU and Human Rights at the University of Essex, reviewed the proposal in 19 tweets:

### Syria

The Red Cross says that 13\.1 million people in Syria are in need of aid, half of them suffering from hunger, and three million \(basically the current population of Idlib\) are trapped in a siege\.


■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 
> **[ICRC](https://twitter.com/ICRC) @ Twitter Says:** 

> > Today in Syria:

- 13.1 million need aid.
- 6.6 million have been forced to flee their homes.
- 6.5 million don’t have enough to eat.
- 3 million are trapped in besieged and hard-to-reach areas.

This is how statistics look in reality. https://t.co/ESWv3ztwt8

### Libya

The German government has information that in Libyan detention centers “the situation is partially degrading”, the Federal Foreign Office replied to a question put by the left wing party in the parliament\. [Zeit Online](https://www.zeit.de/amp/politik/ausland/2018-09/seenotrettung-libyen-10000-gefluechtete) further reports, referring to the Funke Mediengruppe, that acording to information provided by the goverment, the so\-called Libyan Coast Guard rescued some 10,000 people in the first half of 2018\. The Foreign Office added that the United Nations know about 20 of these camps, which are controlled by the Libyan unity government\. The unity government is supported by the UN\. About 8,000 to 10,000 people are believed to be accomodated in such camps\. NGOs assume that there are more unofficial camp sites close to the coasts, in which people are victims of torture and human trafficking\.


■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 
> **[MSF Sea](https://twitter.com/MSF_Sea) @ Twitter Says:** 

> > After @[JunckerEU](https://twitter.com/JunckerEU) ’s #SOTEU earlier today, the EU must acknowledge that current policies exacerbate suffering for #migrants &amp; #refugees in #Libya. “We are struggling to survive,” said this survivor of a recent shipwreck. He is scarred from gunshot wounds received in Libya. https://t.co/EtnXxJbrDV

■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 


However, the government did not publicly answer questions about the concrete human rights situation in the camps or on the collaboration of the Coast Guard with organized criminals\. Making this information public could be “adverse for the security and the interestes of the Federal Republic of Germany”, the Foreign Office said\.

### Morocco

The [Association Marocaine des Droits Humains — Section Nador](https://www.facebook.com/AmdhNador/posts/2184716875073909) reports new evidence of violence in Morocco\. They documented a case in which a man said he had been attacked by auxiliary forces in a forest\. Another one said that he had jumped out of his hotel room, after having been intimidated and harrased by police forces\.
### Greece

The conditions in Moria on Lesvos have often been criticized as inhumane and now the closure of the camp seems imminent if the situation does not improve\. A [statement](https://twitter.com/MSF_Sea/status/1039898076935331840) by MSF shows why there must be a change quickly:


> In the last 3 days we have seen over 300 sick children in our **Moria** clinic\. The camp is bursting with over 9,000 people, many of whom are medically vulnerable\. 




The [Feox team](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=2213454292272537&id=1584119558539350) is still present on Chios and distributes non\-food items to the people of the Vial camp\. They also organise trips for children and families and provide transfers to the hospital\.

Aegean Boat Report accuses the UNHCR of providing incorrect statistics on new arrivals on the Aegean islands\. “This week, 190 people have mysteriously disappeared, again”, ABR [writes](https://www.facebook.com/AegeanBoatReport/posts/445198706003239) \.

### Italy

A partial evacuation of the camp in via Regina in Como happened on Wednesday morning, [Como senza frontiere](https://www.facebook.com/comosenzafrontiere/posts/996247917203935) says\. Right now, activists have collected information on where some of the migrants were moved: 33 Pakistani guys were moved to a Red Cross camp in Settimo Torinese \(Torino, Piemonte\) \. What is worrying is that 12 of them had an appointment fixed with the local commission in Como in these days to “legalise” their position; no one can tell if they will be able now to be present to the interview, nor were they informed of what they should expect now\. If it was all done to prevent them from accessing the reception system and obtaining some kind of protection, then we are witnessing a “conviction” of these people, because their position will never be “regular” in the eyes of the bureaucracy machine\.

### Spain

On 26 September 2018, the European Court of Human Rights will be holding a hearing in the case of N\.D\. and N\.T\. v\. Spain \(applications nos\. 8675/15 and 8697/15\), which concerns the immediate return to Morocco of sub\-Saharan migrants who attempted on 13 August 2014 to enter Spanish territory illegally by scaling the fences which surround the Melilla enclave on the North African coast\.
### Macedonia

In a car crash yesterday, 18 people, between 16 and 50 years old, were injured, five of them suffering severe injuries, [legis](http://www.legis.mk/news/2660/twenty-migrants-got-injured-in-a-van-that-turned-over-before-katlanovo-tunnel) reports\. The accident happened a few kilometers from the tunnel of Katlanovo on the Veles\-Skopje highway\. According to the Ministry of the Interior, the van overturned\. No further information is provided\.
### Hungary

The European Parliament has voted in a required two\-thirds qualified majority to initiate Article 7 against Hungary and called on the EU member states to determine whether Hungary is at risk of breaching the EU’s founding values\. The request was approved by 448 votes to 197, with 48 abstentions\.


> This may be the last moment for the EU institutions to send a clear signal to governments that are keen to copy the Hungarian practices of weakening constitutional democracy\. — [Hungarian Helsinki Committee](https://www.helsinki.hu/en/illiberal-democracy-fails-in-the-european-parliament/) 





The [list of topics](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20180906IPR12104/rule-of-law-in-hungary-parliament-calls-on-the-eu-to-act) which worry the parliament is quite long and includes:
- the functioning of the constitutional and electoral system,
- the independence of the judiciary,
- corruption and conflicts of interest,
- privacy and data protection,
- freedom of expression,
- academic freedom,
- freedom of religion,
- freedom of association,
- the right to equal treatment,
- the rights of persons belonging to minorities, including Roma and Jews,
- the fundamental rights of migrants, asylum seekers and refugees, and
- economic and social rights\.

### Switzerland

“The police charged in at 6am in the morning\. They forced me down on my knees and tied my hands behind my back\. I was in my pyjamas\. They did not let me wash my face\. They forced a pair of jeans and a top on top of my pyjamas\. They had 30 policemen for me\. Me, a single woman and a little boy\. Each policeman guarded the rooms of other asylum seekers so they could not come to my rescue\. I had three people guarding me when I needed the bathroom\. They had to do everything for me because my hands remained shackled\. How humiliating\. They kept saying “c’est bon” to me all the time, because I wasn’t fighting or screaming like the other woman\. I wanted to fight, but I did not want to frighten my son\.

My 20\-month\-old son was screaming all this time\. I could not get to him until we were on the plane\. He was in pieces by then\. He could not eat for days afterwards\. There was no one else on the plane except for the police, and another woman with kids\. They stopped the plane for a while in Pristina, dropped that woman who fought so hard off before proceeding to drop us off in Athens\. They told me not to worry, and that everything will be provided for me in Athens by the Greek state\. I was left at the airport\.”

Bits from the testimonial obtained today by a native speaker, from an Eritrean single mother deported from Switzerland\.” Testimony taken by Action for Woman\.

This is only one case in which the Swiss authorities are being criticized for their actions on deportations\. Also, Amnesty calls on the government to rethink its approach to Dublin deportations\. The United Nations Committee Against Torture \(CAT\) further condemned the fact that immigration authorities did not investigate the case of an Eritrean who had suffered torture and was deported, [The Local](https://www.thelocal.ch/20180911/un-condemns-switzerland-over-deportation-of-eritrean-torture-victim) reports\. His case must be re\-examined\.
### Germany

On Wednesday morning, an airplane with 17 deportees arrived in Kabul\. According to [Welt](https://amp.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article181502428/Abschiebungen-Flugzeug-mit-17-Menschen-in-Afghanistan-eingetroffen.html) , the authorities confirmed the landing of the plane at around 7:30 local time\. It was the 16th collective deportation to this unsafe country since the government reintroduced them in December 2016\. With this flight 366 people have been deported in total\. Up to 400 people protested against the deportation in the city centre of Munich, the refugee council there repored\.

### Sweden

Swedish media report that people in Sweden with foreign roots are anxious over the rise of right\-wing parties during the elections last Sunday\. It is still unclear how a new government will be formed, an AYS volunteer explains\. Earlier today, the alliance of conservative\-liberal parties with Ulf Kristersson from Moderaterna as a potential candidate for the position of prime minister held a press conference\. It was followed by another press conference given by Stefan Löven, who still holds the position of PM\. He denounced Kristerssons’ and his allies’ invitations to discuss a government with Kristersson as PM, and the Social Democrats as a support party\. Still, both sides say that they refuse to work with the Sweden Democrats \(SD\) or form a government where SD has a significant influence on the decision making process in the parliament\. This requires cooperation between and across the former political blocks, something that for now has not been agreed on\. A new government cannot be formed before it is clear whether or not they can get support in the parliament\.
