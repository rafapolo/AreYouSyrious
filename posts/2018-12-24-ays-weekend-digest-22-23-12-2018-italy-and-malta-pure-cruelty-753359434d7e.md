A two day old baby was rescued along with its young mother from a boat carrying 311 people 57 nautical miles from Malta\. As Malta refused to allow a safe port to the other people at risk, as did Italy, they are now bound for Spain on the Open Arms vessel which has enough food for two days and is on a journey which will take 4–5 days\. Malta stated that they rescued the baby for humanitarian reasons, but then refused to provide the provisions needed to keep the hundreds they had refused safe from hunger, including pregnant women, children and other small babies\. Hypocrisy doesn’t cover it\.

Luckily another rescue vessel, the Astral, will bring them supplies of medicines, blankets and food, but the situation remains difficult and neither boat will reach Spain until the 28th of December\.

The Italian and Maltese governments have recently been criticised by [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/08/italy-malta-stop-playing-with-refugee-and-migrants-lives-by-closing-ports/) for closing ports to NGO boats:


> European governments must stop playing with human lives\. Italy and Malta’s disgraceful refusal to allow refugees and migrants to disembark in their ports is pure cruelty\. These individuals have braved dangerous journeys and inhumane conditions in Libya only to be stranded at sea as governments shamelessly abdicate their responsibility to protect\. 





Yet both did so again this weekend, [Italy more than once](http://“AYS Daily Digest 21/12/18 — Italian authorities leave refugees to drown or be returned to Libyan…” by Are You Syrious? https://link.medium.com/i87uEojlUS) \.

After Salvini had engaged in his usual bout of hate speech \(if only there was a law against it…\) on Twitter, the most important political platform for the most intelligent politicians, Oscar Camps of Open Arms replied:

As Sally Hayden [reports](https://twitter.com/sallyhayd/status/1076920553078996992?fbclid=IwAR3T8tt2_j6e_A9dFqycOtRZQlee9QHyW6towZJr0ZQYkKpjjnXV6NEUBR4) , it is the sixth death in Libyan detention centres since mid\-September\. Haftom was detained in the DCIM \(Department of Combating Illegal Migration\) \-run Zintan detention centre\. He was a dental doctor who had fled the Eritrean dictatorship\.

He was one of the many people arbitrarily and indefinitely detained in the 26 detention centres controlled by the DCIM\. UNSMIL \(UN Support Mission in Libya\) staff, authors of a recent [report](https://unsmil.unmissions.org/sites/default/files/libya-migration-report-18dec2018.pdf) , “have consistently observed severe overcrowding, lack of proper ventilation and lighting, inadequate access to washing facilities and latrines, constant confinement, denial of contact with the outside world, and malnutrition \[…\] torture and other ill\-treatment, forced labour, rape and other forms of sexual violence perpetrated by DCIM guards with impunity\.”

Shamelessly, Libyan Naval Spokesman Ayoub Qasim criticised the report, media outlets [report](https://www.libyaobserver.ly/inbrief/libyan-naval-spokesman-criticises-un-report-migrant-situation-libya) :


> “All international organizations and others are applying double standards in implementing their plans, aimed at settling migrants in Libya, by playing the human rights card, from time to time,” Qasim said in a press statement\.

SEA
#### Updates from rescues in the Western Med

Following what was reported in the digest of December 20th, last Thursday six boats were rescued off the Spanish coasts\. According to the UNHCR, “at least 25 people are believed to be dead or missing, including a pregnant woman”\. On one boat 33 people were rescued, but 12 dead bodies were found onboard and 12 more were missing; on a scecond boat one dead body was found while rescuing 56 people\.
#### Sea Watch 3 press release

Berlin, 23\.12\.2018 
Christmas at sea: 344 people rescued within 24 hours — no safe port for the rescued people on Sea\-Watch 3

Since Friday, 344 people have been rescued within 24 hours by the fleet of the \#United4med Alliance, which also includes Sea\-Watch\. While the Open Arms with 311 people on board is on her way to Spain, the Sea\-Watch 3 is still denied a safe port\. A simple solution is possible, as more than 30 cities and several federal states in Germany alone have agreed to accept people rescued from distress at sea\. Sea\-Watch calls on the federal government to find a solution before Christmas\. Those who invoke Christian values are now obliged to act\.

On Saturday, Sea\-Watch 3 saved 33 people from drowning, including several children\. They are now safely on board the Sea\-Watch 3 where they can receive medical care\. Less than 24 hours earlier the Open Arms had already taken in over 300 rescued people\.


> To escape torture, slavery and death in Libya, these people have no choice but to take on the dangerous route across the central Mediterranean Sea at Christmas\. At these temperatures, the chance of survival in the event of a shipwreck is well under 24 hours, we are incredibly glad that we found them in time\. 





> \[…\] At the moment, the situation on board is stable, some of the rescued people help us to keep an eye out in case more people are in distress at sea\. \[…\] To avoid risks for the rescued, we call on the German government to find a solution before Christmas\. If Seehofer wants to defend Christian values, he now has the opportunity to do so\. _\(Philipp Hahn, Head of Operations of Sea\-Watch 3\)_

ITALY
#### November updates from UNHCR

New data has been published by the UNHCR about [arrivals](https://reliefweb.int/report/italy/italy-sea-arrivals-dashboard-november-2018) and [situation](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/documents/details/67396) in the country:
- 23,011 people arrived between 1 January and 30 November 2018, an 80% decrease from last year \(117,042\) \. 3,485 are children\.
- 2,137 people died or are missing at sea\.
- 56% of people arriving departed from Libya \(91% in 2017\); other embarkation points are in Tunisia, Turkey, Greece and Algeria\.
- People registered at landing sites are mainly from Tunisia, Eritrea, Iraq, Sudan, Pakistan, Nigeria, Cote d’Ivoire, Mali and Guinea\.
- 48,339 new asylum applications were lodged in the country in 2018\.


Criminalisation of sea rescue, refusal to offer safe ports, empowerment of Libyan coast guards — these effects of Italian migration criminal policies started with minister Minniti and continued by Salvini can be seen in the drastic reduction of arrivals, and in the increase in the death risk connected to the crossing\.


■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 
> **[Filippo Grandi](https://twitter.com/FilippoGrandi) @ Twitter Says:** 

> > The fact that less refugees and migrants arrive in Europe across the Mediterranean should not make us forget that many of those stranded in Libya continue to suffer terrible abuses. Rule of law however will not be possible without solving the conflict in Libya.

Also this data doesn’t take into account the effects of the conversion into law of the Salvini decree\.

> \[…\] From the moment Usivak camp opened, there was insufficient heated space for refugees, and people have been sleeping in tents in a container ever since\. There is also a heartbreaking shortage of shoes \(imagine wearing flipflops in the snow and being forced to wait outside hours every day just to get food\), blankets and jackets\.

THE NETHERLANDS
#### Let’s bring them home updates

As reported last week, [Let’s Bring Them Home](https://www.facebook.com/WeGaanZeHalen/) organised a convoy of vehicles to drive from Amsterdam to Athens\.

At the moment of writing they have arrived in Athens and are driving to the Greek Parliament\.

This initiative has created a lot of noise and discussion\. Let’s Bring Them Home stated that their intention is to bring 150 people back to The Netherlands with them, and for this reason they published an open letter addressed to A\. Tsipras, the Greek Prime Minister\. As reported by media, they were warned by authorities that their plan could amount to human trafficking\. We stand in solidarity with initiatives shining a light on conditions of people living in camps throughout Greece and it is important that these Dutch activists have decided to take the matter in their own hands, pressuring governments to live up to their promises\. We also need to stress the symbolic character of this initiative, and the risk to raise false hopes in the asylum seekers community in Greece\.

Follow LBTH [here](https://www.facebook.com/WeGaanZeHalen/) for more info; they will have a pot\-luck public meal and a series of events on Monday\!

Local media [report](https://politiken.dk/kultur/art6921907/100-julemænd-vælter-ud-af-propfuld-bus-i-værdigheds-aktion-ved-hegnet-til-Sjælsmark?fbclid=IwAR3N17suFLRH6_p3-QpTXHWVHrVnTBBwb0OZYPe0ysPyZPuE7z-hjroGCQ4) that the Santa Action by art activist group [De femten](https://www.defemten.dk/?fbclid=IwAR3at3gSxUC4V18Tbxa2nILFOWmUUXf8UjmR2uu9AgAEjZm6BJ4YZxujVQs) \(The Fifteens\), during which hundreds of Santas climbed the fence of Sjælsmark deportation centre to play with the kids and cheer up the people there, went well\. The action was allowed to remain peaceful, no police or guards intervened\.


> No children behind the fence\. 
 

> Santa will strike until all these humans gets passports\. 




At the same time some Santas went to visit the integration minister with a wish list for Christmas, which included a humane asylum politics, a full stop on discriminatory rhetoric and a humane life for all\. 
There have been ongoing protests against the conditions in Sjælsmark for the last few weeks\.
