#### Feature

[IOM, UNHCR and the Libyan authorities yesterday met to discuss on the topic _“Migrants Health in Libya”_ \.](http://www.iom.int/news/libyan-authorities-meet-un-agencies-discuss-migrant-health) It was a part of a bigger project named _“Promoting health and wellbeing among migrants in Morocco, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia and Yemen\.”_ The project is funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Finland\.

Libya isn’t really famous for maintaining human rights, rather the opposite\. European countries on the other hand, are famous for doing all they can to run away from taking responsibility\. IOM, International Organization for Migration, is working closely with as well UNHCR and the European Union in questions regarding migration\. They are also working closely with the Libyan authorities in order to promote medical assistance and health interventions, the report says\. This includes activities in detention centers, main disembarkation point in Europe and as a part of voluntary \(which more are “voluntary”\) returns\.

[But, other information is also available](https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1665710826803851&id=976033399104934&hc_location=ufi) \. The Italian journalist Francesca Mannocchi recorded a video in February 2017, from one of the official detention centers in Libya\.

Besides these official centers, there are unofficial ones — run by militias where not even the Ministry have access\. Only in the capital Tripoli there is 13 unofficial ones, according to [Mannocchi](https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1665710826803851&id=976033399104934&hc_location=ufi) \. In the Libyan centers children and sick people are left without access to healthcare\. When the food is out, the food is out\. Stories from one of the official centers, Garian, tells about how 1400 people including 250 minors are held in containers that are locked around the clock\. In each container about 100 people lives\. There is not even enough space for them to lay down on the floor to get a proper rest\.

Officials from the Libyan government admits that they can not always provide with enough services to keep up the human dignity\. Still Mannocchi doesn’t wanna generalize, saying that there are both good and bad people among the guards\. Unfortunately, the good ones doesn’t have the means to do good\.

If it wasn’t for the suffering it causes it would almost be funny how far away political ambitions and statements are from the reality migrants coming to Italy are witnessing about\. [All of those meetings](http://www.iom.int/news/libyan-authorities-meet-un-agencies-discuss-migrant-health) , of the kind IOM, UNHCR and Libya just had, should be looked at with skepticism\. Instead of discussing the horrible conditions that no human should live in, IOM, UNHCR and Libyan authorities met to discuss how to better keep people in this country, rather than helping them to get away from there\. This is just serving the oppressors\.

#### Nigeria

[28 people killed](http://m.france24.com/en/20170816-several-killed-suicide-bomings-nigeria-refugee-camp) and at least 82 people injured after a suicide bombing on Wednesday in the town Mandarari\. The attack was performed by three female suicide bombers, and after the first assailant blew herself up in the air panic broke out\. Soon after that the other two women triggered their explosives, which caused most of the damages\. In August alone approximately 72 people have been killed in northeast Nigeria according to unofficial toll based on media reports\. The terror network Boko Haram is present and has increased their presence this year, after the president Muhammadu Buhari was elected in 2015 and temporary managed to get the situation more under control\.

**Islands**

[Greek Reporter today](http://greece.greekreporter.com/2017/08/16/over-330-migrants-arrived-on-greek-islands-on-monday/?fref=gc) reported that more than 330 people arrived on Monday the 14th August, according to data compiled by the Ministry of the Interior’s National Border Control and Asylum Control Center\. This is a high number for only one day in Greece right now\. Let’s wait and see if this trend will continue, and what will happen on the already overcrowded islands if this would be the case\. In opposite many camps on the mainland are closing, begins to close or are hosting below capacity\. Politics and slow procedures is to blame for this, which creates a hard situation for everyone involved that seeks refuge from war, violence and other unpleasant living conditions\.

**Lesvos**

A boat with 37 people arrived safely to Mitilini today\.

#### Spain

[The Spanish coastguard announced](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.courrierinternational.com%2Fdepeche%2Fmediterranee-600-migrants-secourus-en-un-jour-entre-maroc-et-espagne.afp.com.20170816.doc.rm1hl.xml%3Ffref%3Dgc&h=ATMERRTzhkqH69ZT5UA9qZmE4O8AiqGc0GyUQrupxPGZe7WAa3IR63UobJMJ3xO0SnFCHkwv2GpcWhwaRlUqavlfENrsNrSz5fO3l_P9xLZRw3-a_qdLGapsX337Ovdm7NV6gGgJBMjvC8k) on Wednesday it had rescued 339 people aboard seven makeshift boats in the waters of the Strait of Gibraltar between Morocco and Spain, a route more and more borrowed by migrants\.

_“A total of 339 people have been rescued, in seven canoes, between one and a half hours in the morning,”_ a relief spokeswoman said Wednesday at midday\.

Among the rescued migrants, all transferred to the coastal city of Tarifa, there were at least 19 minors and a baby, according to the first counts\. This new rising number could be a new trend, and according to IOM Spain could overtake the role as the country where the second largest number of migrants arrives in 2017, after Italy\.

Between January and July 2017, 7,642 migrants arrived in Spain by sea, against 2,763 during the same period in 2016\. As of 11th of August, this figure had risen to 8,385 migrants\. In addition, 121 died drowned trying to win Spain, against 128 for all the year 2016\.
#### **Italy**

No One is Illegal had arranged a summer camp for multinational volunteers to be held at Labas Bologna Italy from August 21st for two weeks, however it was raided last week by police and closed down\. Unfortunately, the summer camp is now cancelled\. The plan was to renovate a kitchen, classroom and other rooms to make it habitable for refugees, but also for Bologna’s homeless people\.

Yesterday a deportation from Finland to Iraq was stopped due to resistance from fellow passengers\. As the film at [Stop Deportations](https://www.facebook.com/SeisKarkotuksille/?hc_ref=ARSNEsvUfQkIS8ga5UoTkU5eXEmM2cw53gEKZuAiTQ9IIuYgf34Ax78oxvaumbetc6I&fref=nf) fb\-page shows, violence was involved\. People questioned what was going on, “why are you doing this?” someone in the video says\.

#### Sweden

Heléne Fritzon, the new Swedish Migration Minister, have had an intense start at her new job\. She shortly visited the youths at Medborgarplatsen last Thursday, but still she has not changed her mind\. In the [Swedish Radio](http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=1650&artikel=6757118) this morning she, Jan Björklund \(the liberal partys leader\) and Fredrik Beijer \(chief of law at the Migration Agency\) was in a debate about the ongoing protest and the infected issue concerning deportations to Afghanistan\.

The Migration Agency will in a near future, still not clear exactly when, do a new evaluation about the security in Afghanistan\. However, it is still individual assesments thet will decide if someone gets to stay\. Amnesty, or stop of all deportations to Afghanistan, is not likely\.

Still the opions are divided, some say that it isn not safe enough to deport people to Afghanistan\. Some say it is\. But still none of the politicians in the radio spot, social democrats as well as liberals, express a positive opinion about amnesty for Afghan youths\.

**Meeting at Medborgarplatsen about the protests**

At 8 pm this evening Fatemeh Khavari, held a meeting with information about the next step in the sit in\. It wasn’t for press in first hand but mainly for those withing to both continue protesting and continue attending school, since they all want a future and are aware about how important school is for that\. The topic tonight was guidelines for doing so, among other things, one of the guidelines is to sit down at the floor during breaks\.
