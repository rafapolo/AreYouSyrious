**Denmark** continues to create a two tier system for people on the move in the country and expose its racist underbelly\. [The controversial ‘jewellery law’ which allowed the police to take money and valuables from asylum seeker](https://www.opindia.com/2022/03/denmark-plans-to-exempt-ukrainian-refugees-from-jewellery-law/?fbclid=IwAR0dIOYUdHy7TCL_QCCdAHdKd_LLvnZQR7qlJKPRK883COs8tWkQx0-kkTQ) , and was brought in in 2016 thus targeting Syrians, will not apply to Ukrainians\. They have also brought in a Special Law in line with the EU Protection Directive, but offering a two year rather than one year residence permit which allows for the right to work, healthcare, schooling etc\. [Refugees DK have described this as “pure ethnic discrimination\.](http://refugees.dk/en/focus/2022/march/special-law-for-ukrainians-is-discriminating-and-short-sighted/?fbclid=IwAR3a9k_o2Jo9CQneEv4Cyh1XRPsXfOxJ73g-7bOqQcGf0bVfJd8EJFKO7nQ) ” Meanwhile, [Syrians are still have their residence permits revoked](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/07/world/europe/denmark-syrian-refugees.html?fbclid=IwAR28Og6zEGABXX-_Wgdoy2EZB8dNDiL5Z_s0UGDJMhGePEMUvZNqtbSPSEM) and being placed in indefinite detention away from the their families with the constant threat of deportation to a country which has seen multiple reports of returnees facing extortion, torture, sexual violence and forced disappearance, and with which there is no diplomatic relation\.

### EU allocates 4\.5 million euros to Mauritania

[The EU will pay 4\.5 million](https://www.eldiario.es/canariasahora/migraciones/ue-destina-4-5-millones-euros-luchar-trafico-migrantes-mauritania_1_8810304.html?fbclid=IwAR0lQY7oxVcTzRouQsp3drF14Nqr-vITzuaAV2w7yy2z5mbhMKZy0mZ4yQo) to improve the countries police and judicial systems to “combat smuggling”\. Mauritania is a transit country for people travelling to the Canary islands in Spain\.
#### UK
### More Asylum Shambles

The UK has so far managed to issue a whopping [50 visas](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10585263/Fury-revealed-FIFTY-Ukrainian-refugees-given-UK-visas.html?fbclid=IwAR0fqEBikywiIpH3Lhi5MCdOYszKFURJk2iWiUM6mZmWMFxUIIYyTYo1XXI) to Ukrainians who are trying to join family members, drastically lagging behind EU states\. In total, the UK expects to accept [200,000 family reunification cases](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/39003/hesitant-uk-plans-to-help-ukraine-refugees-are-met-with-criticism-and-ire?fbclid=IwAR3P8SOsOzxm0JkMmI9yDcGPqtkcqa-UlND3FQv4DMflrbsvZgtDWz8e4DM) \.
### November’s 27 deaths took place in British waters

On the 24th of November last year [the tragic death of 27 people](https://inews.co.uk/news/channel-migrants-dinghy-sank-deaths-uk-waters-1484702?fbclid=IwAR3KuCXQIKsk2EEKLlFVA7AR_50maKkHKs60c5UY6djalAGDhtjX-8uHW-A) became evident as their bodies started to be discovered in French Maritime waters\. What was not revealed at the time was that these young people had made it to British waters after all and likely died there\. People who die at this stage of their journey have often survived many difficulties and dangers already, have made friends and helped out other people, have taken part in projects and worked or volunteered along their route\. Their loss is felt right the way along it, through all of Europe, all the way back to the place where they started\.


![Research by [i](https://inews.co.uk/news/channel-migrants-dinghy-sank-deaths-uk-waters-1484702?fbclid=IwAR3GcY3oAfQzkuk4OpKLSkKOLXzq3Hsccu-NXD_LnjSmCD0VJxhucDPHmWQ) puts the location of the dinghy given by the smuggler at 2\.03am UK time within the search area of the HM Coastguard helicopter, which took off around one hour and 20 minutes later\. It is to the north east of a mayday alert raised by the French coastguard inside French waters at 1\.03pm\. i has been unable to independently verify the origin of the image\. \(Data analysis and mapping by Thomas Saunders, i data reporter\)](assets/28d924c325e1/0*OChKSVRW9Mhc6OHu.jpg)

It is to the north east of a mayday alert raised by the French coastguard inside French waters at 1\.03pm\. i has been unable to independently verify the origin of the image\. \(Data analysis and mapping by Thomas Saunders, i data reporter\)

If it was proved the dinghy was in UK waters, a public inquiry could consider whether “acts or omissions” by British agencies resulted in human rights breaches and contributed to the deaths\.
#### GENERAL

The refugee crisis of people fleeing Russian military aggression against Ukraine once again lays bare the inadequacies, to put it mildly, of refugee protection and cross\-border migration law and policy\. The EU’s [temporary protection Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32001L0055) does not afford third country nationals [who have moved to Ukraine in recent years](http://eulawanalysis.blogspot.com/2022/02/temporary-protection-for-ukrainians-in.html) the same protections as Ukrainian citizen nationals, noting that temporary protection is afford to ‘persons leaving their country or region of origin’\. Over 470,000 third country nationals in Ukraine, including many overseas students and labour migrants, are currently stranded, trying to find safe passage to Moldova, Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland\.

It is estimated that more than 1\.5 million people have now fled [Ukraine](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_location=Ukraine) since the Russian invasion\.

671 people have arrived into Ireland from Ukraine but they have gone straight to family already living here\. After that the officials are looking at finding accommodation for the people\. Their estimate is that the country will take in 2% of the estimated number of people who will leave Ukraine, which means that over 100,000 will be welcomed in [Ireland](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/ireland-may-take-in-more-than-100-000-ukrainian-refugees-minister-says-1.4819785?fbclid=IwAR0K7Zo58pxKHCVx9G9Wn35YjjRtKjC0Wq6SIYyZUPgHAyK2rIspV2AHXWs) \.

According to several media reports, a little more than 500 Ukrainian refugees have appeared in the port or tunnel in Calais to enter the UK\. More than half have been refilled by the Border Force\. About 150 have stayed in Calais, the others have probably gone to Paris to attempt to get a UK visa\. For now no news of the “British Consulate in Calais” hoped by Darmanin\.

The youth hostel \(European Vacation Center\) has welcomed, to date, about 130, and now there is no room left\. What about those that will be showing up in the next few days? City Hall and sub\-prefecture are not responding\.
