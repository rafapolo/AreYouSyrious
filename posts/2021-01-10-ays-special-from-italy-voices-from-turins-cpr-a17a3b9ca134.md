### AYS Special from Italy: Voices from Turin’s CPR

On January 6, [**ACAB:Aperitivo Controinformativo Ardecore Balengo**](https://radioblackout.org/shows/acab/) **,** a program on Turin\-based [Radio Black Out](https://radioblackout.org/) , [got in touch with two detainees in the city’s CPR \(pre deportation centre\)](https://radioblackout.org/podcast/a-c-a-b-diretta-dal-cpr-6-1-21/) \.

This comes after weeks of protest and brutal repression in several detention centres in Italy\. On Christmas night, 2 people attempting to escape from the CPR in Gradisca d’Isonzo \(northeastern Italy\), were stopped, taken back to the centre and violently beaten up\. On New Year’s eve, detainees protesting in Ponte Galeria CPR in Rome, were met with CS gas thrown into the closed structure\.

The two detainees in Turin called the radio from public phones, as all mobiles had been seized by the centre’s guards\. Here are their voices:


> I’m in the expulsion centre in Turin\. I call it a concentration camp, because here they treat us like animals\. People are desperate here, we are in a situation that — if you’d see it — you’d cry\. 






> When I arrived, they left me for 24 hours in the cold, to welcome me\. 




When detainees arrive in the CPR for the first time — they explained — workers gave them one disposable mask, to be used for the duration of their detention\.

At the end of December, winter arrived in Turin\. “When it snowed, people here were shivering from the cold, because there were no jackets\. We asked for them, they laughed at us\.”

**This is not a prison**

When a detainee needs to go to see a doctor, a magistrate, or a lawyer, they must be ‘escorted’ by around 15 officers from Police, Carabinieri, Army, Guardia di Finanza\.


> Do you think this is human? People here have risked their lives at sea, they spent money to arrive here and they are treated like criminals… 





> And not just that, people here cry, they risked their lives and spent their money to be put into a prison\. “But no, this is no prison,” they tell you\. “Are you joking, did you see this place? What is it, if not a prison?” 




#### If you want medical treatment, go back to your country\.

O\., a man from Tunisia, was detained despite suffering from a serious injury\. He has 33 lead splinters in his foot\. In the centre, no one checked on him\.


> he has been on hunger strike for 7 days now … He had been seen only by a nurse, who told him that everything was fine\. He was crying, he was afraid he’d loose his foot\. 





Thanks to his strike, a doctor finally visited him\. He came back from the doctor crying\.


> Yesterday he the doctor visited him and told him, “if you want to be treated, you have to go back to your country\. We won’t treat you here\.” They won’t even look him in the eyes\. They treated him like an animal\. When I said this to one of the guards, they told me, “Shut up\! Don’t bother me with this, tell it to your sister…” 





> They insult us and our families\. They call us ‘extracomunitari’ \(illegal aliens\), they treat us like something ‘extra’\. 






> O\. is afraid of losing his foot\. But he’d prefer losing his foot than his dignity\. We all have dignity\! 





> Another detainee suffered a nervous breakdown\. He went crazy and no one did anything… There were the soldiers, and they were watching and laughing while he was throwing himself on to the ground, hitting his head against the wall, ingesting things\. 






> Are we joking? Is this the Italian democracy? People think that they arrive here to find democracy and human rights, and instead they are treated like animals\. Sorry if I sound nervous, I can’t talk, what I have inside is heavy and it is difficult to express\. 





> We are in northern Italy, near the French border, in the middle of democracy … We are treated like animals … People here are asking for authorities, politicians, to come here and see how we are treated\. Someone, anyone\. 





> Also the food is bad, it stinks\. I’m not saying that they should give me 5\-star\-hotel food, but something simple\. Instead it’s just bad and it stinks … \[but\] the most important thing, regardless of food, etcetera, is the right to healthcare\. Here there are people who need to be visited and treated and no one does anything\. The police, for example, with their uniforms, they should be setting an example, instead they watch and laugh\. I’ve never seen anything like this\. 




#### **Violence and abuses**

The CPR is divided into different wings, named after colours\.


> In the Blue Area, the other day, \[guards\] smashed the foot of one man\. 





Other detainees were also recently beaten up\.


> they had set on fire the area in which they were living, but not because they enjoy doing that … they burned the area because there was a guy who was sick, and no one wanted to take him to the hospital\. They had to do that to force the guards to take him to the hospital, and he was finally visited\. But when the guards got into the area, they beat everybody up \. \. \. There was 7 of them … Two of them have been taken to one room in the Blue Area, and other 5 in a common room … They were kept in the cold, with no heating or hot water, they couldn’t have a shower … They stank\. 





> This is Italy, not the third world\. 





> Inside here, I have seen things I didn’t even imagine\. I hope that our voice will get out of here and something will change\. Seeing a human being treated like this… it can’t be about race, the human race is only one\. But not even a cat or a dog can be treated like this\. It makes me cry, we don’t ask for much\. We ask to be treated like humans\. That if someone needs to be treated by a doctor, they get the treatment they need\.
