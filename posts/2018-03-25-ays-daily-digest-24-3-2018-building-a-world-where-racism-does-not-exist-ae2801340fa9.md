### Feature

We have to fight racism and xenophobia all over the world\. In Europe, this was a week marked by protests under the slogan _“Diversity — never enough”_ \. Unfortunately, this is a slogan that many politicians and citizens have chosen to ignore\.

In Tel Aviv, Israel, some 25\.000 people marched on Saturday against the deportation of African asylum seekers\. They carried the slogan **_“There is no difference between our blood and their blood because we are all human beings\.”_**

This is just another stage in protest against deportations to Rwanda and Uganda that were scheduled to begin on April 1\. However, under the public pressure, the High Court of Justice has suspended this decision until it rules on a petition against deportations\. The government is scheduled to file its response to the petition on Monday\.

The big rally was organized by Sudanese and Eritrean asylum seekers and supported by a large number of locals, youth movements, as well as groups of holocaust survivors\.

One of the speakers at the rally, Sudanese immigrant Monim Haron, described himself as genocide survivor\.

_“For 14 years the government has deliberately attacked its citizens with chemical weapons,” he said\. “Just this week the region where I was born and raised was attacked again, and again dozens of people were killed, mostly women and children\. And I’m not a refugee? So who is a refugee? There are many like me in Israel,” he said\. “They go on the bus with you, they wash the dishes in your restaurants, they clean the streets you walk\. And they are in daily fear for the people they love\. But the government of Israel doesn’t want us here\.”_

His words should be heard all over Europe\.

As the support to refugees in his country, Israeli artist Ehud Banai rewrote his song from 1987 titled “Black Work” \(Avoda Shehora\) and rerecorded it to protest Israel’s plan to deport African asylum seekers\.

The first stanza of the song says:

_“Our dark\-skinned brothers who came from Ethiopia brought with them a wonderful and ancient tradition\. The lost sons, after the hardships of the road, slowly discover the faraway land they dreamed of for years, and now it’s the reality when they tell them to immerse, to wash away their innocence\. And I saw a light in their eyes, and who knows if \[the patriarch\] Abraham wasn’t black?”_

There are approximately 38,000 African asylum seekers in Israel, according to the Interior Ministry\. Among them, about 72 percent are Eritrean and 20 percent Sudanese\. The vast majority arrived between 2006 and 2012, via Egypt\.

Israel politicians, but also big part of the public, considers them to be job seekers — economic migrants whose lives were not in danger in their countries of origin\. However, this view does not account for the reality of violence and war in many african nations\. While rarely publicly expressed, a prime reason these refugees are being targeted is the color of their skin\. In Israel, some politicians call refugees “infiltrators\.”

### Greece

The Greek government continues to pressure international volunteers, especially on the Aegean islands\. Recently we have received many reports about the seizure of vehicles\. The [Hope Project](https://www.facebook.com/HopeProjectKempsons/posts/2042791389335316) issued a warning saying that everybody should be aware of these restrictions, especially at Lesvos\.

_“When bringing aid to Lesvos please be aware of the restrictions of the authorities\. No foreign registered vehicles are allowed to move items inside Greece even if they are within the 6 months allotted time\!”_

The fine could be up to 5,000 Euro and seizure of the vehicle\.

_“Foreign registered vehicles can only be driven by the registered keeper, and may only remain in the country for six months in a year\!_ 
_Also be aware if you are driving here ensure that… if you are from outside the EU you will need an international driving license\._ 
_Do not overload the vehicle with more passengers than it is licensed for\._ 
_The incidents over the last weeks are too many to list, vans impounded, license taken, plates taken, please be extra careful\! \!”_

Additionally, they warn that everybody should be aware that if arriving with aid in a suitcase, it is possible that if you admit you are helping refugees, you may be questioned by the authorities\.

Due to new restrictions, Hope Project will not be able to accept parcels from outside the EU\. If you want to help from outside the EU, visit their FB page to learn the procedure\.

RefuComm issued series of very informative films that explain the procedures on the Greek Islands\. Videos are available in different languages\.

“There is minimal access to sanitation meaning people do not get to wash or change their clothes, leading to skin infections, scabies and worse\. In every area Care4Calais distribute, across Calais, Dunkirk, Caen and Brussels we see this every day\. Imagine spending weeks in one dirty pair of jeans or joggers… walking for hours on end, constantly being on the move in rain, cold and bleak conditions\.

We can fully clothe a refugee for just £13 — new t\-shirt, hoodie, joggers, boxers, and socks\. Please help us deliver this basic standard of decency by donating £13 now [https://goo\.gl/jmkx7A](https://goo.gl/jmkx7A) "
