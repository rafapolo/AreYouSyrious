Alarm Phone says it was called by a boat coming from Libya with 150 people including 50–60 women and 30 children\. Their engine stopped working and no rescue was in sight\. The group has since then lost contact with the boat and as feared, they have been picked up by the Libyan Coastguard and taken back to Libya according to [Times of Malta](https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20190211/local/new-crisis-looms-as-150-people-drift-at-sea-in-the-central.701736) \.

A new [Time article](http://time.com/5510517/facebook-smuggling-libya-ransoms/?utm_source=emailshare&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=email-share-article&utm_content=20190210) shows once again why bringing people back to Libya is not the solution\. The article shows how people are being tortured, sold between trafficking gangs and held for ransom, forcing their families back home to resort to Facebook to collect donations from friends and family\.

Alarm Phone also says that, with no rescue vessels operating in the Mediterranean, the current situation disproves the myth that rescue vessels are pushing people to try the route\.

Meanwhile, [Avvenire](https://www.avvenire.it/attualita/pagine/immigrazione-open-arms-e-i-sindaci-spagnoli-dal-papa-poi-il-patto?fbclid=IwAR1bdg2WUqK52waBVNHm952tzLQ-_7w5xpcg4Kaf9TcbrYBd3niteh6tixU) says the founder of Proactiva Open Arms has been received by the Pope, together with the mayors of Madrid and Barcelona, to discuss the situation at sea\. Representatives of Sea Watch, Proactiva Open Arms and Mediterranea also met with the mayors of Valencia, Zaragoza, Palermo, Milan, Bologna, Napoli, Siracuse and Latina\. Together they asked for support for NGOs involved in helping migrants in the Mediterranean and hope to challenge the current policy of blocking ports\.

The first boat landed on northern Lesvos with 48 people\.

The second boat landed in Kalo Limani, Lesvos north west 06\.20\.

The group has been working in Greece, including in Chios and Athens, since 2016, distributing more than 700,000 food portions\. You can find out more on how to volunteer or donate directly on their [website](http://www.zaporeak.eus/) \.

Volunteer teachers and youth workers are needed on Chios for Action for Education, which provides the largest voluntary run education service on the island, as young people over 14 are denied public education there\. Volunteers are also needed on Samos were Action for Education set up a safe space for children and youth\.

[Refugee Protest Camp Vienna](https://www.facebook.com/RefugeeCampVienna/) says around 19 of February, many Afghans will be deported from Austria, partly on chartered planes\. The group advises people who are possibly under a deportation threat not to go to a police station if you are informed to go there for “gelinderes Mittel”\. It also advises avoiding places were police controls are common, such as railway stations or underground stops\.

People at risk include those who are undocumented or had a second negative decision in their asylum case\. An [event](https://hdb.dibk.at/Termine/negativer-Bescheid-was-nun?fbclid=IwAR2MxudEyFguyrKUf-XgTj2dqU7vsnqdrW5OZv0zWJfs4pn5GQ8wjbKEeb0) will take place today in Innsbruck for volunteers, to discuss how they can help migrants after a negative decision\.
