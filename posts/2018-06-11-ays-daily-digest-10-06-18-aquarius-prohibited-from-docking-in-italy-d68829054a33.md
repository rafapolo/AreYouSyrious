[Italy’s new right\-wing Interior Minister Matteo Salvini](https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20180610/world/malta-italy-in-second-migrants-standoff-in-three-days.681395) effectively closed the ports of Italy to 629 people on board the Aquarius, contesting that Malta should accept the vessel and those on board\. This is the first time the Aquarius has been prevented from reaching Italian harbours\.

On board the vessel are a number of vulnerable cases\. There are 123 unaccompanied minors, 7 pregnant women, and 111 children who left Libya and were rescued in various SAR efforts during the night\.

The Aquarius is currently still waiting for a port of safety to be assigned. https://t.co/su4BHwwEv7

Salvini wrote on Facebook:


> “Malta takes in nobody\. France pushes people back at the border, Spain defends its frontier with weapons, from today, Italy will also start to say no to human trafficking, no to the business of illegal immigration\.” 





Malta has refused the request, insisting that under International Law it is not obligated to accept the refugees on board\.


■■■■■■■■■■■■■■

We will continue,where possible, carrying out individual&amp;humanitarian emergency medical evacuations -JM

However the government has issued a statement saying that in conformity to its policy throughout the last years, Malta is willing to carry out emergency medical evacuations of vulnerable cases requiring urgent medical response\.

**A number of people and organisations are protesting the decision of the Italian Interior Minister:**


> An unprecedented decision in our country, adopted in agreement by the ministers of the Interior and Infrastructures Danilo Toninelli, which violates the European Convention on Human Rights and offends the sense of humanity that should always guide the representatives of the Institutions\. What we are asking for is a political and human gesture\. We ask the mayors of port cities, which open the ports to humanity in a symbolic way\. We ask the politician, we ask the citizens, do not close to humanity\. — [Baobab Experience](https://www.facebook.com/BaobabExperience/) 





[A campaign/petition](https://www.change.org/p/luigi-de-magistris-napoli-disobbedisca-accogliamo-la-nave-aquarius-respinta-da-salvini) has started asking for the opening of ports in order to allow these people to disembark in any welcoming place\.


> We ask the Mayor of Naples, Luigi de Magistris, to take action to immediately welcome the Aquarius with its 629 desperate\. 





In response to the decision, Italian Mayors of Palermo, Reggio Calabria and Naples are offering to allow the landing of the vessel on their docks according to [_SOS Refugiados_](https://www.facebook.com/sosrefugiados/) \.

[The mayor of Palmero](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/10/italy-shuts-ports-to-rescue-boat-with-629-migrants-on-board) has publicly stated that he would allow the Aquarius to dock in the Sicilian capital\.

Currently the Aquarius remains on standby awaiting further instruction of where to dock as the [dispute between Italy and Malta](https://www.tpi.it/2018/06/10/salvini-chiude-porti/) continues about who is responsible to take care of the people on board\.


■■■■■■■■■■■■■■

Salvini has stated that this summer in Italy will not be one characterised by arrivals\.

A further 152 people who did not make it onto the Aquarius were taken by the Libyan coast guard and returned to detention centres within the country\.

> Sea Watch: At least four boats with hundreds of people are currently on the central Mediterranean in distress and there is no ngo nearby that can help them\.
 

> We do what we can to achieve them, but since we were detained for 12 hours with pointless interviews in the Italian Port, we are still far away\.
 

> This shows not only that the EU does not have an interest in sufficient human resources, but above all that this behavior increasingly threatens us towards people in distress\.
 

> Where is the EU, where is frontex? Why are there not enough capacities when thousands of people die every year?

#### Distress call from the Mediterranean:

A distress call was received from a group of women and children stranded on the Spanish island of Chafarina\.

They warn that there have been illegal pushbacks to Morocco from this island in the past\.


> We urge the Spanish authorities to do the right thing and provide this group of women the chance to apply for asylum in Spain\. Bringing this group back to Morocco is a clear violation to their basic human rights\.
 

> We demand immediate attention and urgent effort to rescue the group\.
 

> We wish them the best in these peculiar and difficult times\. 




### Turkey:
#### Turkey has installed a 764 km security wall on the Syrian border

#### Unconfirmed reports of kidnapping in Moria

There have been unconfirmed reports that masked men entered a caravan and kidnapped a girl inside Moria camp on Lesvos\. We will continue to follow this story\.
### Bosnia
#### Update on Velika Kladusa:

In Velika Kladuša, hundreds of refugees are eating in dining rooms in large groups, sharing a table, plates and cutlery\. A group of locals have organised to work together with the owner of the dining space to provide food every day\. Although there remains a lot of work to do, it is inspiring to witness how this Bosnian community has opened up their arms to provide care for refugees\. This is especially important in a time where authorities have banned the supply of food in Sarajevo\.

#### [SOS Team Kladuša](https://www.facebook.com/SOSTeamKladusa/?fref=mentions) are building pavilions to provide shade for refugees

As temperatures have been rising, they have been working on a new project in a camp in the inner city of Velika Kladuša where hundreds of people are living to provide shade from the sun but also as protection from heavy rain\. These projects are supported by [Cars Of Hope Wuppertal](https://www.facebook.com/carsofhopewtal/?fref=mentions) , No Name Kitchen and SOS Team Kladuša\.

They report that since the evacuation people living in the streets are spread across the North of Paris\.

A group of 7 people are sleeping on the ground along the main road with no tents, a lot of noise and pollution\.


> What we’re seeing now is that a lot of people who took part in the evacuation — mostly under the Dublin procedure — are being put on the streets with no option or solution whatsoever\. 
 

> Those not back in the streets yet are still being transferred from place to place, in often isolated or filthy places, in gymnasiums or huts, with no privacy and very little support

> Tomorrow, the French state will once again forcibly remove families from makeshift shelters in Dunkirk\. Whilst we support getting people off the streets, the relief is only short term and we fear the lack of information shared about where families will be taken will cause tensions\. 





> This continual uprooting of those displaced with no long term solution causes immeasurable stress and drains resources\.
