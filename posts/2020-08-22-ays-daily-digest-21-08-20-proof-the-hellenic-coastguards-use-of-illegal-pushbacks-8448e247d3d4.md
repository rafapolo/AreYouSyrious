### AYS Daily Digest 21/08/20: Proof \-The Hellenic Coastguard’s use of Illegal Pushbacks

Visual investigation of maritime pushbacks // Plans to increase deportations from the EU //Attack on MSF clinic in Moria // Death in Melilla
### Feature

Border Violence Monitoring Network \(BVMN\) has published a new visual investigation analysing video footage which shows how the Hellenic Coastguard \(HCG\) were involved in maritime pushbacks\. The investigation was a product of a joint\-investigation by [_Josoor_](https://www.josoor.net/) _and [No Name Kitchen](https://www.facebook.com/NoNameKitchenBelgrade) on behalf of the BVMN\._

The investigation conducted by _Josoor and No Name Kitchen_ focuses on a series of four videos filmed on 11 July showing masked men on a medium\-sized vessel approaching a dingy filled with women and children\. The man who filmed this video sent the materials over to Josoor while still on the dinghy, after this he reported being returned to Turkey and held in detention for a period of two weeks\. The purpose of this analysis is to better identify the individuals and the vessel involved in the operation, which resulted in the pushback of the group\.

Using the distinct mountain lines featured in the background in two of the clips and Google Earth’s topographic satellite renders of the Aegean Sea, the investigators were able to geolocate the incident and demonstrate that the dinghy was being chased east towards Diliki, Turkey as it was intercepted by the HCG vessel\. This geolocated area matches with information [posted](https://en.sg.gov.tr/current-operations-10-13-july-2020) from Turkish Coast Guard of a rescue operation on 11 July at 10:00 am off the coast of Dikili, Turkey\. It was their only reported rescue of that day\.

Within the investigation, the team at Josoor and No Name Kitchen were also able to identify the HCG vessel involved in the incident\. Through analysing the distinct colouration and markings of the boat, they ascertained that the boat in question is one of two [Faiakas](http://en.c4defence.com/Archive/turkish-coast-guard-vessel-intercepted-hellenic-cg-boat/9457/1) \-class fast patrol crafts \(FPCs\) currently operated by the Hellenic Coast Guard — this one being the ΛΣ\-618 and the other being ΛΣ\-617\. By identifying the vehicles use, they were also able to demonstrate that the acquisition of these vessels by the HCG was majority financed via the European Commission’s External Borders Fund, which provided for 75% of the cost, with the rest consisting of domestic funding\.

_Photo\-stitch of the vessel ΛΣ\-618 shown in the video footage, with identified men present\. \(Photo credit: [BVMN](https://www.borderviolence.eu/bvmn-investigations-analysis-of-video-footage-showing-involvement-of-hellenic-coast-guard-in-maritime-pushback/?fbclid=IwAR0rkzUjMIrqNP3wCCEQURvb0QoMS96eiSND72uXbDWcPq6rDTR-BqI4VXo) \)_

The team concluded that the masked men on this boat, who wore uniforms identical to those previously worn by the vessel’s crew\-members, were acting in an official capacity, despite the Hellenic Coast Guard’s spokesperson previously stating that [“under no circumstances do the officers of the Coast Guard wear full face masks during the performance of their duties”\.](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/06/23/masked-men-on-a-hellenic-coast-guard-boat-involved-in-pushback-incident/)

This analysis clearly links the materials shown in the videos to the well\-documented trend of maritime pushbacks by the HCG in the last months\. This investigation disproves the statement of Greek government spokesman Stelios Petsas who [told](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/world/europe/greece-migrants-abandoning-sea.html) the New York Times that “Greek authorities do not engage in clandestine activities\.” This investigation also further confirms the conclusion of previous investigations that the HCG is engaging in pushbacks, casting strong doubt on Prime Minister Mitsotakis statement from 19 August that “ [it has not happened](https://twitter.com/camanpour/status/1296150232976195585) \.” Pushbacks, whether they be on land or on sea, are illegal procedures, emboldened and made more efficient by EU funding mechanisms\.

■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 


According to the UNHCR and IOM, the shipwreck on 17 August was the worst of the year in terms of deaths along the Central Mediterranean route\. Twelve bodies were recovered\. According to the reconstruction of the 37 survivors, after the engine failure, the boat was intercepted by armed men aboard a fishing boat, who promised to take them to safety in exchange for their phones, the engine and their money\. But in reality, they would threaten them and eventually shoot at him, causing the shipwreck\.

Ahmed Omar, a 26\-year\-old Sudanese survivor of the [shipwreck, explained:](https://www.avvenire.it/attualita/pagine/libia-il-racconto-dei-superstiti-della-strage?fbclid=IwAR0Krd9g-3Buc3fMCM-gFn6bz833ZQ5idYNkcO0kUqoZIe0vZ4QWaRbzBD4)

“We left Zuara at four in the morning, after several hours of navigation the engine broke\. We called Italy, Malta and Spain\. The GPS was broken, we didn’t know exactly where we were\. We saw an oil rig, but we didn’t understand where we were, ”

“We met a boat on which was written ‘Captain Salam 181’, onboard there were Libyans and Egyptians armed\. They asked us if we had a satellite phone with us, we said we had it, they told us that if we gave it to them, they would tow us to the Libyan coast, we accepted because we were desperate ”, continues the survivor\. “They pulled us with a rope for four or five hours, then they asked us to give them the GPS, our phones and our money, but we said we didn’t have any, then they started threatening, they told us that if we had not given them the money, they would have let us die: we had run out of food and water ”\.

According to Omar, the armed men shooting at them caused the boat’s engine to explode and cause a fire\.

After a few hours, Libyan fishermen intervened and attempted to rescue the people overboard, but not before ‘about forty people died’\. The fisherman brought them back to Libya, where the police wanted to return Omar along with the other survivors to the detention centre in Zuara\. In an unexpected turn of events, the director of the migrant prison refused to imprison them, deciding that these people who were covered by burns, some with hypothermia, others with the typical symptoms of those who survived the drowning deserved treatment elsewhere, not in a prison\.

[As of 20 August](https://www.avvenire.it/attualita/pagine/libia-il-racconto-dei-superstiti-della-strage?fbclid=IwAR0Krd9g-3Buc3fMCM-gFn6bz833ZQ5idYNkcO0kUqoZIe0vZ4QWaRbzBD4) , 7 122 refugees and migrants have been registered as intercepted at sea and disembarked in Libya\. Currently, an estimated 2 267 refugees and migrants are being held in prison camps in Libya\.
### EU

Statewatch has released a new report called _Deportation Union: Rights, accountability, and the EU’s push to increase forced removals\._ This report provides a a critical examination of EU legal and policy measures designed to step up the number of deportations, in particular those coordinated and funded by Frontex, the EU’s border agency\.

The report explains how the EU’s border agency is set to assist with the deportation of 50,000 people annually in the coming years\. Between 2007 and 2018, the agency aided in the deportation of some 53,000 individuals including over 850 people who were expelled to Afghanistan and almost 300 to Iraq\.

The plan to increase the number of deportations from the EU and step up Frontex’s role will be aided by two other developments that have been analysed in depth in the report\. The first is an attempt to water down rights and protections set out in the EU law governing deportation proceedings; the second is an increase in the amount of personal data on migrants held in EU databases, at the same time as facilitating swifter access to those systems\.

Following changes to its legal mandate in 2016 and 2019, Frontex is to acquire increased means for coordinating peoples’ removal, including through new databases to monitor the “stocks and flows” of individuals subject to deportation proceedings, the ability to process increased amounts of personal data, and powers to deploy increased numbers of ‘escorts’ and other officials on deportation flights\.

However, the report warns that these new powers are not matched with sufficient measures for democratic oversight and scrutiny, or remedies for those who may have their fundamental rights breached during a Frontex\-coordinated operation\.


> Jane Kilpatrick, co\-author of the report and a Researcher at Statewatch, remarks:
 

> “Frontex frequently stretches its mandate to the limit, overstepping legal boundaries until a new regulation is introduced legitimising its activities\. Accountability mechanisms included in the texts are insufficient, both in scope and functionality, to keep up with the agency’s increased role and influence\. That the monitoring of Frontex’s deportation operations will now be organised and financed by the agency itself is a primary example of these deficiencies\.”

### Greece

[The UNHCR has stated](https://www.unhcr.org/gr/en/16207-unhcr-concerned-by-pushback-reports-calls-for-protection-of-refugees-and-asylum-seekers.html?fbclid=IwAR0DXFz3zUp74xvpPU3ZQV2YJGQshWPbl0AGG3wAr155eAYmEnCtVjVdMq8) that it _“Remains deeply concerned by an increasing number of credible reports indicating that men, women and children may have been informally returned to Turkey immediately after reaching Greek soil or territorial waters in recent months\.”_

The organisation has again called upon Greece to refrain from such practices and to seriously investigate these reports, which include a series of credible and direct accounts that have been recorded by the UNHCR Office in Greece and have been brought to the attention of the responsible authorities\.

The UNHCR further stated that it is particularly concerned about the increasing reports, since March 2020, of alleged informal returns by sea of persons who, according to their own attestations or those of third persons, have disembarked on Greek shores and have thereafter been towed back to sea\. The press statement also remarks that worryingly UNHCR has also received reports and testimonies about people being left adrift at sea for a long time, often on unseaworthy and overcrowded dinghies, waiting to be rescued\.

When presented with similar concerns in a [CNN interview on Wednesday,](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/26766/greek-pm-to-cnn-we-do-not-push-refugees-back) The Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said _“These types of reports are also an insult to our coastguard \[which\] has saved literally tens of thousands of refugees and migrants at sea, and our islands have always provided shelter to those in greatest need,”_

While Curmi explained that there was an obligation on the country to coordinate a rescue operation in respect of anything entering the search and rescue area of ​​Malta, he stated that sometimes it’s not needed, but this particular case was one where people needed help\.

This public statement comes just days after a parliamentary petition calling for Malta to stop taking in illegal immigrants reached [40,000 signatures\.](https://lovinmalta.com/news/local/after-reaching-40000-signatures-maltas-anti-illegal-migration-petition-organisers-look-towards-a-referendum/) This petition currently holds the highest number of signatures on any parliamentary petition created during this legislature\. The curators of the anti\-migrant petition hope that this will enable a referendum ‘on the topic’\.

Hassan Akkad, a Syrian refugee who arrived in Britain via the Channel crossing and now works in the NHS has been beamed on to the White Cliffs of Dover by campaign group Led By Donkeys\.

In the video, he said: _“Hello everyone\. Apologies for taking over the cliff but I have a few words that I would love to share with you\._

_“My name is Hassan and five years ago I was on the other side of this Channel trying to cross here\. These cliffs were actually visible from our makeshift camp and they represented hope\.”_

He continued: _“Crossing the sea in a rubber dinghy is terrifying and devastating\._

_“Devastating because it makes you feel so helpless and insignificant\. And I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy\.”_

Over 8,000 complaints have been lodged following a live news segment on August 10 on BBC Breakfast that saw reporter Simon Jones broadcast live from a boat that had pulled alongside a dinghy containing migrants, some of whom said they were from Syria\.


> During the report, Mr Jones told viewers: 
 

> “We have seen them trying to get water out of the boat, they’re doing that at the moment, they are using a plastic container to try to bail out the boat\.
 

> “People are wearing life jackets, it is pretty dangerous, just the number of people on board that boat\.” 





After asking whether they were safe, Mr Jones remained with the boat until its occupants were picked up by the UK Border Force\.

A spokeswoman for the broadcaster said: _“This report was a stark illustration of the significant risks some people are prepared to take to reach the UK\. “Channel crossings is a topic of huge importance and we always endeavour to cover the story sensitively\._

Kent Refugee Action Network has published a response to news that newly arrived young people seeking asylum in the UK are being held by the Border Force in an unspecified building in Dover\. They demand that the following information be made public:


> \-Have their needs been assessed ?
 

> \-Are they being detained? If so how long will they be held for?
 

> \-Is the Unit at which they are being held suitable accommodation for young people ?
 

> \-Are their basic needs being met, washing facilities, clean clothes, food etc?
 

> \-Do they have access to legal advice, and independent advocates such as the Refugee Council?
 

> \-Are adults being held at the same facility?
 

> \-How is their safeguarding being ensured and how are they being supported? 





They call upon their supporters to consider emailing their local MP about this issue if they share the concerns of Kent Refugee Action Network\.

Despite the rain, there were about fifty of them to watch to make their rights heard, to demand their regularization as well as the return to France of Mohammed Lakhel, a Algerian expelled in 2019\.

Speaking at the event Tanina \*, an undocumented Algerian who arrived in France in 2013 said: “ _I entered France in 2013 with an installation visa\. I came with my French husband, but when we arrived, he forbade me to work and to continue my studies\. I was not allowed to go out\. and he wanted me to follow the Muslim religion when I am not a believer\. We separated six months later”_

“ _After my separation, I moved to Lille, I applied for a residence_ permit _\. For three years, they gave me receipts_ \[document which allows me to stay in France regularly during the examination of the file by the prefecture, editor’s note\] _, which allowed me to work and be an employee\._

But after four years, despite having a series of temporary contracts, Tanina received an obligation to leave French territory \(OQTF\) \. The prefecture of the North tells her that she has not respected the two\-year period of living together with her French husband, requested to regularize her situation\.

“ _The law therefore obliges me to stay with a violent husband\. It is not possible\!_ “, She indignantly\. “ _I made a first appeal which failed\. I then joined the Undocumented Migrants Committee where I made a second appeal\. Since then, I continue to fight, hoping that my file will be accepted_ \.”
