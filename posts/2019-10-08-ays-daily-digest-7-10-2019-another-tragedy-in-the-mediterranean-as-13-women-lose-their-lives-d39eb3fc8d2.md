#### FEATURED STORIES

In the night between Sunday 6th and Monday 7th October, another tragedy happened off the shores of Lampedusa, when [a boat with 50 people on board capsized](https://www.tpi.it/cronaca/naufragio-lampedusa-migranti-morti-20191007465476/?fbclid=IwAR3hkqn4AbzAcvHHT7552SisegCJYxxiLNaN9GZ9iEctF8YKj7orM-k5Ock) \. 13 women are reported to have drowned, including a 12\-year\-old girl and a pregnant woman\. 22 survived, but still many are missing; among those lost at sea, there are at least 8 children and one woman and her 8 month old baby\. People on board were from Tunisia and other subsaharan countries, confirming [the shift that is happening in the depature route](https://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2019/10/07/news/migranti_naufragio_nella_notte_a_lampedusa_recuperati_due_cadaveri-237874064/?fbclid=IwAR3dFJS5Gku7dNvNjnqCF8MZz4djYfn2AzvDLSIU3CEO2Q-RtOVCgee75rM) \.

The survivors were accompanied by the ICG and Guardia di Finanza to the mainland\. As investigations continue, the public prosecutor of Agrigento stated that all the people on board were travelling without lifejackets, adding that this tragedy could have been avoided and that all of the credit is to be given to the ICG and Guardia di Finanza for their quick intervention, completely overlooking the role of those NGOs doing SAR operations in the Mediterranean and that could have eaily intervened, possibly saving the lives of those on board on time\.

Adding to this, the weather forecast for the area surrounding Lampedusa and Sicily is getting worse, making it even more difficult to intervene at sea\.

While tragedies are happening in the central Mediterranean, no better news is reaching us from Greece, where [570 people have reportedly been transferred from Lesvos to mainland](http://www.ekathimerini.com/245239/article/ekathimerini/news/570-migrants-transferred-out-of-moria-camp?fbclid=IwAR2hvTX4WD5JoHkMXLGiaSeAD84h1ZtjFNPAVi2r3GCwm-VYPm3xoQxYhvk) on Sunday\. Most of them are considered “vulnerable people”, including single women with children, families and unaccompanied minors\. The plan is to transfer them to a camp near Thessaloniki\.


> Authorities say this is part of the plan to reduce overcrowding at the camp, where about 13,000 people live in a space designed for 3,000\. 




[Transfers to the mainland were expanded](http://www.ekathimerini.com/245249/article/ekathimerini/news/greece-expands-program-to-transfer-refugees?fbclid=IwAR1LZgGQUqHRpwJOs0rMXcdJOrkP_6V-NX8cuhMrij74uIg5A5ngQcPa8L4) to Sunday and Monday from all five Greek islands in the Eastern Aegean Sea hosting refugee camps, including [Symi](https://www.facebook.com/symivolunteers/posts/2444153065640005?hc_location=ufi) \.

However, conditions for those transferred from the islands or from evicted buildings in Athens are not better, as this testimony reaches AYS from Corinth, where residents of evicted 5th School in Athens were taken\.

![And also there are these machines\. They seem to be heaters, but I don’t know whether they are water heaters or space heaters for the tents\. And these are parts for them\. They are here\. But I cannot understand why they are not being used\. We freeze at night\. At midnight, it’s feels like ice here\. Credit: AYS\.](assets/d39eb3fc8d2/1*UJXPbyz4nglfH6IiUXElVg.jpeg)

> There is running water, but only cold water, not warm\. Every time, I force myself to wash up\. I’m just so cold\. 
 

> As for blankets, when we first came they gave each one of us one blanket\. The second time they gave us a few more, but there were not enough for everyone\. It’s not enough, unfortunately\. Also they haven’t given us pillows\. There are no pillows\.
 

> And the electricity gets cut off periodically\.
 

> Each week they remove 5 to 10 families from here and send them to other camps\. But unfortunately our turn has not yet come\. Initially they told us a few days, but it’s been three weeks\. We’re waiting\.
 

> Last night, several people got sick from the food they gave us\. It was spaghetti with meat\. And also potatoes\. I got sick\. Since last night I’ve had to go to the toilet maybe 15 times\. My father also ate the meat and he too is sick\. 



#### TURKEY

In an unexpected statement today, [Trump green\-lighted a possible Turkish invasion of Northern\-Eastern Syria](https://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2019/10/07/us-turkey-syria-greece-kurds) , in a direct offence against Kurdish YPG forces in the area, whom were until now supported by a US coalition\.

He also added that Turkey will become “responsible for the IS prisoners in the area”, indicating a major shift with catastrophic consequences not only for the local Kurdish population, but also for the number of arrivals that will be leaving the country and reach already overcrowded Greek islands\.

Erdogan’s view is to establish a “safe zone” in the Northern part of Syria, de facto clearing it from Kurdish forces, regarded as terrorists by the Turkish president\. The “safe zone” will expand to 30 km inside Syrian territory\.

Allegedly, Turkish attacks have started during the night, as shown by this video\.

#### CENTRAL MEDITERRANEAN

The 44 people rescued by Open Arms on Sunday night off Lampedusa will be disembarked in Malta\.

Caritas Intemelia **_Ventimiglia_** has published [October’s schedule for their clinic](https://www.facebook.com/caritasventimiglia/posts/2895244537170353) in town\.

H\., a Georgian citizen detained in the CPR \(Centro Permanente per il Rimpatrio\) of **_Torino_** , has been on hunger strike for the past 21 days and has refused water for the past 4 days\. He is protesting the harsh living conditions inside the centre, worsened by the fact that he is confined to a wheelchair\.

Hot water is not present in the structure, despite the numerous protests made by those detained in the building\.

Please, [follow LasciateCIEntrare for more updates](https://www.facebook.com/LasciateCIEntrare/posts/3350374834987700?hc_location=ufi) and campaigns to close these inhuman detention facilities\.

Alarm Phone has published a very comprehensive analysis regarding the Central Mediterranean region for the past 3 months, reporting a worrying increase of SOS calls in the timeframe: the organisation stated that they received 39 calls for help, involving 2,337 people\.

“It \[first\] highlights the ongoing mass interceptions to Libya that are considerably supported by EU actors, and then turns to the ongoing mass dying at sea, with the official \(but inaccurate\) number of deaths having exceeded the 1,000 mark\. After briefly pointing to the vital rescue operations carried out by NGOs, often after being informed by the Alarm Phone, it discusses the situation for migrants in Malta before highlighting the increase in independent boat arrivals in Europe”\.

See report [here](https://alarmphone.org/en/2019/10/05/cm-regional-analysis-2/?post_type_release_type=post&fbclid=IwAR06_W6R7uG4w-0ku4mZUUFPAdqVr3Pq-RtIj4jHsFoBFzWSjPURXqOPkks) \.
#### WESTERN MEDITERRANEAN

[Fifty\-eight people \(of whom 7 women\) were rescued](https://www.efe.com/efe/andalucia/almeria/rescatan-a-58-personas-entre-ellos-7-mujeres-en-patera-el-mar-de-alboran/50001123-4081447?fbclid=IwAR3Sy8NEH_a8KRP2pX5q2TQgUaq2aOYmw43rWuJlwfj3dqHAHV21NanspGw) in the Alborán sea tonight; all of them had departed from Morocco\.
#### GERMANY

The rate of success of church asylum has plummet in the past years, according to Süddeutsche Zeitung \(SZ\), with less than 2% of deportations of those requesting humanitarian protection stopped by German authorities in 2019\.


> In 2015/2016, about 80% of claims were successful, according to the German Ecumenical Committee on Church Asylum\. By 2018 the success rate had fallen to around 12%, the _SZ_ reports\. In the first eight months of 2019, there were just five successful cases, while 292 claims were rejected\.

#### SWEDEN

A local politician from the Social Democrats has been involved in human trafficking from Greece to Sweden, according to an investigation by the paper Expressen\. He has “helped” several people leaving Greece for the price of €2,000\-€3,000\. Despite video evidence, the man denied the allegations when confronted by reporters and said he was in Greece for vacation\. Reportedly, he got in touch with people through an add on Facebook, which seems to have been posted two months ago\.

He left his position in the municipality a few days after the first article was published and said that he “deeply regretted” what he had done\. A spokesperson for the social democrats in the relevant municipality, who is not named, said that they were not aware of the trafficking\.
