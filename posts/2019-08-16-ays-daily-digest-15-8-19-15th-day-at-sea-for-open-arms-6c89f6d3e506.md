In an update from Camp Vucjak: ‚ÄúAbout ten of the men who were deported to Vucjak work with us in the ambulance tent \[‚Ä¶\] depending on how much help and security we need\. They are volunteers, just like us\.‚Äù It costs about 500 euros a day to keep the ambulance running\. Find out [here](https://www.facebook.com/dirk.planert/posts/10219463913456884) how you can help\.

Many unaccompanied minors are still at risk around the internment centre in Obrenovac\. [Volunteers report](https://www.facebook.com/AzilUSrbiji/posts/1302878609871978:0?hc_location=ufi) that at least two minors don‚Äôt have any access to food or toilets, and are made to leave the camp every morning at 9am\. One of the minors has a serious skin infection, but is unable to receive medical attention since he has still not been issued a camp card\. Unaccompanied minors remain some of the most vulnerable people along the Balkan route\.
### **France**

[With more people](https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/hauts-de-france/migrante-iranienne-disparue-au-large-du-pas-calais-apres-tentative-traversee-manche-1710956.html?fbclid=IwAR2f7SQgTEdwUKHd82QafneCXDMxAG-zNhWekmoc5muV2Oa7uNUk-G3vzvA) trying to cross the English Channel in some boats to the UK, one woman is still missing at sea since Friday August 9th\. Two other people from the same boat were found\. People are continuing to risk this particular journey at a deadly cost\.

### **Scotland**

Some 300 people are awaiting eviction in Glasgow\. In a new move from the Home Office, authorities are changing locks of refugees‚Äô accomodations in order to force them out\. This removal campaign was highly criticized earlier last year when these policies were enforced, which is why they took a hiatus until now\.
