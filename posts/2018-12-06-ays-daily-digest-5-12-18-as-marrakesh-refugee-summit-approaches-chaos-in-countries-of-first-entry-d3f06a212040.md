As the Marrakesh Conference on refugees and displaced people approaches, various nations both within and outside the E\.U\. are getting cold feet\. The conference, which will be held on December 10 and 11, is the culmination of two years of negotiations, discussion, and compromise, as Head of Eurasylum Solon Ardittis [writes](https://www.newsdeeply.com/refugees/community/2018/12/05/whats-to-fear-in-the-u-n-global-compact-for-migration?fbclid=IwAR2BhkXD4n0X0dG8w8Q7DiHsi_mpzeCQBug-ojHJAFxwrd9R0Cspn3BE8B8) in an excellent primer\. But now, with the 30\-page compact that is the product of countless hours of meetings set to be adopted next week, a growing list of countries that includes Austria, Bulgaria, Hungary, the Czech Republic _,_ Poland, Slovakia, and the U\.S\. have signaled their unwillingness to sign\. What‚Äôs more, Italy is on the fence, and Belgium is beset by internal, compact\-related discord so serious that their government is on the verge of collapse\.

The Marrakesh conference comes at a time when the asylum services of E\.U\. countries of first entry are at their breaking point\. AIDA and ECRE are [reporting](http://www.asylumineurope.org/news/04-12-2018/spain-severe-delays-registration-asylum-applications) that Spanish authorities are experiencing ‚Äúsevere delays‚Äù in registering asylum seekers, with families forced to sleep outside overnight to register and people repeatedly being turned away\. **Those who are finally successful in making it to the front of the line are given a date ‚Äî not for their interview, but merely to lodge their asylum claim\.** The dates that are currently being handed out are as late as 2020\. According to both Spanish police and the ombudsman, ‚Äúthe system has collapsed\.‚Äù A group of French and Spanish NGOs have called for an immediate reform of the Dublin Regulation, which places an undue burden on peripheral E\.U\. countries, [here](http://www.forumrefugies.org/s-informer/communiques/augmentation-des-arrivees-en-espagne-l-europe-doit-sortir-la-reforme-de-dublin-de-sa-paralysie) \.

The situation in Greece, where asylum seekers routinely queue overnight outside the various asylum service offices only to be told to ‚Äúcome back tomorrow,‚Äù is hardly better\.

After crossing the border into Greece, one Turkish family of 4 \(parents, a 4\-year old son, and a severely disabled 9\-year old daughter\) spent six months in an unofficial camp in Lavrio\. During that time, they tried but were unable to register for asylum\. Finally, today, they were moved to an apartment in Athens and successfully registered ‚Äî only to discover that their interview date has been scheduled for five years from now\.

Five years of limbo, stress, uncertainty, and anxiety\.

Five years during which their lives will effectively be on hold\.

This glacial processing time is likely due to be the dramatic increase in Turkish nationals seeking asylum in Greece in the past calendar year after widespread political unrest and the persecution of dissidents\. There are not enough Turkish translators in place to process these claims, and the system has been characteristically slow to respond, leaving families like this one stranded, unable to accept that their case will not be resolved ‚Äî whatever its outcome ‚Äî for half a decade\.

Meanwhile, in Morocco, any trace of the visible refugee presence is being hastily swept under the rug in preparation for the upcoming summit\. It‚Äôs ironic that a conference intended to bring about better treatment for displaced people is being held in Morocco, where migrants from Sub\-Saharan Africa are routinely subject to dehumanizing and illegal treatment by the country‚Äôs authorities ‚Äî but then again, leaders would be hard pressed to find a conference location that _wouldn‚Äôt_ inspire a sense of hypocrisy\.

‚ÄúOnly a few days away from the Marrakesh summit, the arrests, refoulements, and expulsions continue,‚Äù Nador New posted on Facebook today\. The group reports that the Nador authorities are attempting to empty out an illegal detention center called Arekmane and deport its inhabitants ‚Äúin order to temporarily camouflage \(the government‚Äôs\) violations\.‚Äù A group of Malians, Guineans, and C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoirians who were being held in the detention center were deported today, and around 140 Cameroonians were reportedly pushed back to the south of Casablanca yesterday\.

Even if it were ‚Äî miraculously ‚Äî unanimously passed next week, it‚Äôs impossible to say what tangible impact the Marrakesh compact will have on the lives of displaced people like the Turkish family waiting in Greece, or the African migrants struggling to survive in Morocco\. But when decisions about the fate of refugees remain in the hands of out\-of\-touch lawmakers with little understanding of the range of struggles that come with being displaced, when years of endemic procedural chaos in individual countries‚Äô asylum systems has been seen as the price of doing business, when E\.U\. countries in the north have routinely and continually ignored the greater burden that the Dublin regulation places on their Mediterranean counterparts, and when a country‚Äôs authorities can welcome dignitaries with one hand and shoo away desperate people with the other ‚Äî it‚Äôs hard to be too hopeful\.
#### LEBANON

Tragedy strikes the Bekaa settlement, as two refugees are killed in a fire that destroyed many others‚Äô homes as well:

IOM Libya also [responded](https://www.iom.int/news/iom-responds-latest-humanitarian-tragedy-coast-libya#.XAgoSMIs6-k.twitter) to the tragedy: ‚ÄúWe continue to advocate for alternatives to detention for migrants returned to Libyan shores, specifically for those most vulnerable\.‚Äù A physician for the organization noted that all of the survivors were suffering from extreme cases of dehydration and exhaustion after being marooned at sea for over 10 days\.

[According](http://www.amna.gr/ota/article/315452/Schediasmos-na-meinoun-kato-apo-50000-oi-aitountes-asulo-ston-kataulismo-tis-Morias-?fbclid=IwAR27hTTM3YUhbT_hK4s3yVC-8B12TOwEn72ajpM8ORXojt9h3d0EFNfsxLs) to the Ministry of Migration, there will be under 5,000 asylum seekers staying in Moria by week‚Äôs end\. Around 100 camp residents will be transferred to the mainland today, and 800 more will follow them this weekend, leaving about 4,900 residents in Moria and an additional 1,200 in Kara Tepe\. Note that according to the same figures, there are still well over 4,000 asylum seekers on Samos, many times over the hotspot‚Äôs official capacity\. According to [Aegean Boat Report](https://www.facebook.com/AegeanBoatReport/photos/a.285312485325196/485976815258761/?type=3&__xts__[0]=68.ARBinjB30Byysjqly3-PfLYWBeNcxgeXyaG328uUwsVJX8-v140VBGvgZaz2-Cl7ShMI2tzYdwHup66JJxe0sqgDeVOPfy-ve_xOWjEKWu--rjioYpX1pZRnKB_anOrZvero2DtytpxoLo_2bfNwFMyhCdM1KrQSM9HystnWAMCvQaxyxY7jVll1DlFPofbGEN6jfGccq96drAQd_c7feIqi9ivJlgl51JegUwectWGI3t_x8EdTGUbYUicTpkiddXTtFYqCxo_Ym7ODtZWguzq7dwZIlrIvrla92Nkyb3pysj9aMNr31fiOq5IYU3MMHt4SCkHQuoE0SS51o0msNb4&__tn__=-R&hc_location=ufi) , 40 more people arrived there today after a boat sent out a distress signal late last night\.

ABR also reports the arrival of 54 people, including 22 children, to Chios, whose Vial hotspot currently houses around 1,400 people\.

### Calais

Refugee Info Bus has released a new report documenting use of force by police against migrants in Calais\. Volunteers have recorded nearly 1,000 incidents of human rights abuse in the past year, including instances of physical violence towards children as young as 13\. Read the full report at the Info Bus [website](https://www.refugeeinfobus.com/refugee-info-bus-refugee-rights-eur?fbclid=IwAR2QXtDjpLgRwViD7tHWHc9IkjIo89dctktkj8-zGWT14kc-feNCtCrgqfU) , and while you‚Äôre there, use their template to contact the French Minister of the Interior and denounce this violence\.

### Deportations

Al Jazeera France has released an extremely disturbing [video](https://www.facebook.com/asso.utopia56/posts/2189133287785118?hc_location=ufi) of a man being deported by airplane whose identity has been completely obscured by a mask and helmet, screaming for help as his fellow passengers look on in shock and confusion\. ‚ÄúHelp me\! I need help\!‚Äù he cries in French as police officers on either side of him grip his arms, completely blank\-faced\. In the video, David Rohi calls this practice ‚Äúroutine\.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe state organizes this type of expulsion,‚Äù he says, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not at all an isolated incident\. It must be known that France deports many people each year this way ‚Äî restraining, masking, and muzzling them ‚Äî which is obviously completely shocking and can be generally situated within a policy that is very, very repressive toward migrants\.‚Äù
### Paris

Solidarit√© Migrants Wilson [reports](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1034464743420964&id=598228360377940) that its volunteers had to reduce their standard portion size last night in order to feed everyone who had lined up for food ‚Äî 400 people last night alone\. Unfortunately, police brutality in France isn‚Äôt limited to the north\. The group also reports coming across a number of refugees whose belongings had been stolen by police ‚Äî an incident confirmed by a number of French passers\-by\.

Given that the very supplies that might help refugees get through a frigid Parisian night are being arbitrarily confiscated, **SMW has organized a clothing donation for this Friday December 7 and Saturday December 8 at 10am and 6pm\.

#### GERMANY

Buzzfeed News Germany has [leaked documents](https://www.buzzfeed.com/amphtml/marcusengert/seehofer-schaeuble-bundestag-zurueckweisungen?__twitter_impression=true&fbclid=IwAR2KFotZvZlI4B_Mw2FwM1Pj7IquZWQp57aUch3XDTptXuegxHSAKopViOo) detailing an agreement made in secret between Interior Minister Horst Seehoffer and Spain and Greece, and the German Parliament is none too pleased\.

The deal concerns the speedy return of refugees caught crossing the German border who previously arrived in Europe through Greece or Spain and had their fingerprints taken in one of the two countries\. The Bundestag, Germany‚Äôs federal parliament, is arguing that this multilateral compact affects E\.U\. law and that Seehoffer has thus violated the parliament‚Äôs rights by keeping the agreement and its details confidential\.
