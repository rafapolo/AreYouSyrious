#### Tragedy in Kara Tepe—baby dies due to inadequate medical help

A baby from a Somali family [died in the Kara Tepe camp](https://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2021/07/21/one-year-old-refugee-child-dies-in-kara-tepe-camp-on-lesvos/#.YPgId5b0cJE.facebook) \. Reports say that the child was experiencing fever and vomiting after [possibly choking](https://www.stonisi.gr/post/18664/thanatos-vrefoys-ston-kara-tepe) during a meal\.

The baby was first taken to camp medical facilities and then to the hospital, but by the time they reached the hospital, the doctors could do nothing\. According to initial reports, the child was not transported to the [hospital in time](https://nealesvou.gr/ektakto-nekro-paidi-enos-etoys/) —maybe if the response had been swifter, this baby would still be alive today\.

For months people have been pointing out that the medical facilities in the new, “temporary” Kara Tepe camp are not adequate to meet the medical needs of the people\. What if the people had adequate medical care, would this family not have to go through the pain that they are feeling now?

Our thoughts are with the family of this poor child\.
#### SEA
#### Updates from SAR zones

The rescue ship SeaWatch3 is [back in action](https://twitter.com/seawatch_intl/status/1417878807298678789) following a long blockade\! After rescuing 363 people from distress at sea, the ship was arrested in Italy on 21 March\. Now she is on her way to the area of operation\. The crew will use the days\-long crossing for further training and preparations\.

NGO „MOAS“ states that [97 people died at sea](https://twitter.com/moas_eu/status/1417816999837712387) during the last two weeks in the attempt to cross the ocean and find a safer place\. As the number of people on the move risking dangerous sea crossings continues to remain devastatingly high, we need safe and legal routes\.

On\-site activists report that, as was the case the previous day, a large number of people [have been intercepted](https://twitter.com/msehlisafa/status/1417812589090902023) by the Libyan Coast Guard\. Today, \(at least\) 20 people died at sea while 230 were pull backed to Libya\. Again, a recurring tragedy, leaving people to die without a face or a name at sea, while the rest of the people are taken back to detention and torture\.

[Thirty\-two other people](https://newsicilia.it/agrigento/cronaca/ancora-sbarchi-a-lampedusa-arrivati-altri-35-migranti-nella-notte-trasferiti-tutti-allhotspot/693314) reached Lampedusa safely by boat\.
#### GREECE
#### Months into the vaccination campaign, still limited access for people on the move

Samos Volunteers [published a statement](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58e2b73fb3db2bb2904ca55b/t/60f800d70f31d77fba3da1e8/1626865883623/PR+Vaccination+campaign+Samos.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1tEM_Yg8B8pzRZt3n0D4vnrjGCjx0Qj_fVc6EoEf3hsoA8jv0HUth6-vI) detailing the exclusionary treatment facing people on the move when they try to access COVID\-19 vaccines\. Although the Greek Health Minister is encouraging all people, including Samians, to be vaccinated as a ticket to freedom, the government is not extending that same access to people on the move, who are also among the most vulnerable to infection\.

The government claims that there are not enough doses for people at the Vathy camp, leading to irregular vaccination attempts, but there are plenty of doses for [Greek residents in Karlovassi](https://twitter.com/samosvolunteers/status/1417829255157850112) , only a few kilometers away\. The vaccines are also only available to people with their AMKA or PAAYPA cards, and many have had theirs randomly deactivated over the past few weeks\.

Samos Volunteers are stepping up by booking appointments for people on the move and driving them to Karlovassi for their appointments to get the J&J vaccine\. However, this should not be the job for a group of unpaid volunteers, but for the government\.
#### Public Prosecutor’s office and Ombudsman obligated to investigate pushbacks

The Hellenic Observatory of the Helsinki Accords said that Greek authorities, specifically the Public Prosecutor’s office and the Ombudsman, [have an obligation](https://racistcrimeswatch.wordpress.com/2021/07/21/1-1211/?fbclid=IwAR1PJNI-GhzLR11alzEV_GU9OBnK5ieiwGaWtXNtk8FlXCcd0RXYj7g9guo) to investigate at least 200 cases of pushbacks\. In support of this obligation, they shared two reports\.

The pushbacks are ongoing, as shown by [this photo identification](https://twitter.com/maledictus/status/1417878480952467463) where the same people photographed on Lesvos were then found at sea by the Turkish Coast Guard\.
#### SERBIA
#### Info Park updates

People on the move have experienced harsh and unreasonable treatment, especially since the beginning of July\. Earlier this month, several police brigades gathered all refugees and other migrants from public spaces and abandoned buildings in the Savamala neighbourhood in Belgrade and transferred them to Preševo Camp by bus\.

Police, assisting Serbian Commissariat for the Refugees and Migrants \(SCRM\), don’t take into account the individual situation of the arrested individuals\. They force the transfer upon them as different cases show: Two young men who already had their ID cards that had been issued by SCRM in another camp were put onto buses to go to Preševo\. The police dismissed this apparent official proof of their regular registration\. As far as children were concerned, police disclaimed responsibility for following official registration procedures, even in the case of an official ID card by SCRM\. Stating that even with the document in front of them only SCRM could approve children’s minorities, the police would not let go of an obvious underaged boy until externals succeeded in reaching a SCRM official\. He approved the boy as underage after “assessment” and so he could leave the bus eventually\.

But even this lucky case spotlights the random age assessment taking place\. This is undertaken by momentary SCRM shift managers without proper medical, psychological or any additional assessment\. Inappropriate age assessment practice leads to violations of human and children rights in Serbia\. This can be illustrated by two separate cases from the previous week\. In the first, two unaccompanied boys from Afghanistan were assessed as adults, even though they possessed documents issued in Greece and their appearance matched their proclaimed age\. On the other occasion, three unaccompanied boys were assessed as underage by SCRM’s evening shift and therefore allowed to spend the night there\. However, in the morning they were ordered to leave, as the assessment changed and they were considered adults\. They were referred to a reception center for adults in the south of Serbia, so Info Park provided tickets for safer arrival\. Once the boys were on the bus, SCRM called and claimed they would not be accepted for accommodation there, as they are, in fact, underage\. These occurrences show how random the whole registration procedure is and therefore key decisions develop in the bigger frame\.
#### ITALY
#### Supreme Court criticizes Court of Appeal’s failure in migration case

The Italian [Supreme Court ruled](https://www.meltingpot.org/La-Corte-di-Appello-non-ha-esaminato-i-documenti-prodotti.html?var_mode=calcul&fbclid=IwAR3tPshoBJkp5Auubcz2VScBKC6Mn0re-Ntyibif4wtjWfKzy9-VQtyAFHc#.YPlru5MzZQK) that the Court of Appeals needs to retry the case of an Ivorian citizen because it did not bother to consider the full documentation produced by the lawyers\. When deciding if an applicant needs humanitarian protection or not, courts must consider a comparative assessment of a person’s situation in their country of origin and in their home country, but the court did not even assess documentation from the point of integration\.

While hopefully this means that the person at the center of the court case will have a new shot at receiving protection, it is worrisome that Italian courts are able to dismiss crucial evidence arbitrarily in migration cases\.
#### Libya is not a safe country — but it is a recipient of Italian funds

The Italian Chamber of Deputies voted to continue providing financial assistance to the so\-called Libyan Coast Guard despite recent reports from Amnesty International, Doctors for Human Rights, and the IOM about human rights violations\. The cost of the operation has also increased\. From the op\-ed by [Stefano Bieggi](https://www.meltingpot.org/La-Libia-non-e-un-paese-sicuro-Ma-l-Italia-aumenta-i-fondi.html?var_mode=calcul&fbclid=IwAR00cphA5Adh1VLLH3A4gkjYo59NS8NsCMoDGjeBPVacO03w3BsbzZQEmow#.YPltJ5MzZQK) :


> Despite these data, despite the detailed and irrefutable reports published in more than four years of the Italy–Libya memorandum \(strongly supported by the Gentiloni and Minniti government\), and despite the Libyan Coast Guard resorting to real [**war tactics to stop the boats**](https://www.meltingpot.org/Azioni-di-guerra-nel-Mediterraneo.html#.YPgKkTrOM1l) , well, without batting an eye, the House confirmed and approved this system on 15 July\. \[…\]Only 34 have raised opposition to the system \(however, most are still in the majority who support the Draghi government \[ [**4**](https://www.meltingpot.org/La-Libia-non-e-un-paese-sicuro-Ma-l-Italia-aumenta-i-fondi.html?var_mode=calcul&fbclid=IwAR00cphA5Adh1VLLH3A4gkjYo59NS8NsCMoDGjeBPVacO03w3BsbzZQEmow#nb4) \] \), all the others are knowingly complicit in abuse and torture\. Let’s not forget this\. 





Updates from Ventimiglia

Kesha Niya published their update on the goings\-on at the French\-Italian border in Ventimiglia in June\. Hot conditions have been dangerous for people on the move, who have little water or shelter from the heat\. Many have nowhere to go after they are pushed back from the French border\.

The collective runs a breakfast spot but neighbors have made a fuss, complaining about the “mess” even though people do their best considering the circumstances\. The city sent an urban cleaning company to the area with a police escort who randomly arrested three people, sprayed chemicals everywhere, and confiscated tents and mattresses\. Many people also reported other instances of police violence\.


> As long as the French and Italian cops treat people on the move the same as other European governments do, without any dignity and respect, the area around the ‘breakfast spot’ will be full of trash\. The trash is not produced by the people on the move, nor by activists from ‘Kesha Niya’, but by the border itself\.

#### FRANCE
#### Volunteers needed\!

Independent HRO \( [Human Rights Observer\)](https://twitter.com/HumanRightsObs/status/1417885527865442307) in Northern France is looking for volunteers again for at least two months or more\. Volunteers are needed in Calais and the nearby city, Grande Synthe, to document and denounce the human rights violations perpetrated against people in exile who are present in the region\.
#### BELGIUM
#### We won’t forget the people on hunger strike\!

We won’t forget: After several people from Brussels had to be delivered to the hospital due to kidney and liver damage during the last days, yet another 24 hours of the continuous hunger strike passed\. Meanwhile, the only reaction of the Belgian government remains the tent they provided that offers information on how best to secure their residency status — an offering made to people who are between life and death, some of whom have been residing in Belgium for years or even decades without being regularised\. Nearby, today, there has been a call for attention in front of [Église du Béguinage](https://twitter.com/europeanleft/status/1417853043312365569) , where some of the protesters are housed\.
#### GERMANY
More collective deportations to come

In contrast to Norway’s, Finland’s and Sweden’s governments, which gave in to the request of Afghanistan to pause deportations after seeing an increasingly unstable situation and the spread of Taliban violence throughout the country since the final withdrawal of international troops, which had been interfering and influencing internal politics for decades: Germany holds to its tradition of pretending that Afghans leaving their country on a long life\-threatening route could not have had good reasons for doing so in the first place\. The following [dates of deportations](https://twitter.com/BFR_089/status/1417815872119480323) have been predicted so far by German Flüchtlingsrat: 27 July 2021–Nigeria, 28 July 2021–Pakistan, 10 August 2021–Afghanistan\. More information to follow\.
#### UK
#### UK giving more money to France for border control

The UK government is sending an additional [62\.7 million euros](https://www.euronews.com/2021/07/21/uk-to-pay-france-62-7-million-to-curb-channel-migration?utm_term=Autofeed&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter&fbclid=IwAR2-F40w8LuDesvbyxpuM7dspXMevIx73UGe-xMmZtk64S-MwsA6bM9k8_w#Echobox=1626845174) to France to increase patrols along the Channel, invest in surveillance, and fund reception centers in France\.

Who knows how many people that money could feed if it were actually put to good use, instead of being sent to a police force that evicts the vulnerable and brutalizes people on the move…
#### WORTH READING

Fake news as a link: Researchers for the ISD report found that clusters within the [networks that spread misinformation](https://www.euractiv.de/section/desinformation/news/fake-news-zu-migration-das-bindeglied-zwischen-rechtsextremisten-und-etablierten-parteien/) about refugees contained both mainstream political actors and clearly right wing extremist accounts — in different languages and countries in the EU\.
