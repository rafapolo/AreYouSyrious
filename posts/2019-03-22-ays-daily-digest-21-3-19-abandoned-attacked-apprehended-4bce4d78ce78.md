### Libya

Malnutrition, abandoned children, overcrowded rooms; Medicines Sans Frontieres [reports](https://www.msf.org/alarming-rates-malnutrition-and-inhumane-conditions-tripoli-detention-centre-libya) disastrous conditions for people detained in the Sabaa centre in Tripoli\. Altough the teams assisting there could not provide photos, they speak about more than 300 people in the camp, including 100 minors\.


> The findings support numerous individual testimonies which state that people in the detention centre receive only one meal every two or three days, and that new arrivals to the centre can wait up to four days before receiving food\. 




“What we see today in this single detention centre is symptomatic of an [uncontrolled, unjustified, and reckless system](https://www.msf.org/stop-arbitrary-detention-refugees-and-migrants-disembarked-libya) that puts the lives of refugees and migrants at risk,” says Karline Kleijer, MSF’s head of emergencies\. In one room, a MSF team saw 31 people locked up in measurements of 4\.5 by 5 metres giving only 0\.7m² per person\. People are being denied the basic necessities required to sustain human life, Kleijer said\.

### Sea

Mission Lifeline [published](https://mission-lifeline.de/aktuelles/gerichtsprozess-claus-peter-reisch-malta/?fbclid=IwAR2eh1quZ0Er7WkmHJxsj67JnYP5kHacKue6IUy2nxnKXyqBmgWG0LHVgFc) an update on the trial against its captain, Claus\-Peter Reisch, in Malta\. As his mother became sick and he wanted to be with her, the trial has been halted — a glimpse of humanity\. The next hearing is scheduled for 2nd April\.

Meanwhile, Sea Eye’s ship Alan Kurdi [left](https://sea-eye.org/alan-kurdi-setzt-kurs-auf-libysche-rettungszone/?fbclid=IwAR3CkdjSYKlHUEg2ogG8A7740QgwXVFVh4aT7KNrxPB0TjNdHZXhSaINIE8) the harbor of Mallorca for its next mission in international waters off Libya\. At the moment, it is the only ship in the region, Sea Eyes says, as the operation Sophia ends on 31st March\.
### Greece

The Greek Council for Refugees \(GCR\) and CEAR \(Comision Española de Ayuda al Refugiado\-Spanish Commission for Refugees\), with the support of the Municipality of Madrid, released a video about pushbacks in the Evros region\. “Despite the continuous and repeated reports by the Greek Council for Refugees and other organizations on a great number of pushbacks incidents, the Greek government continues to remain indifferent and does not react,” they state \(via RefuComm\) \.

Yesterday, two boats carrying 51 people arrived on Lesvos, Aegean Boat Report [recorded](https://www.facebook.com/AegeanBoatReport/posts/543485546174554) \. Also on Wednesday, the Turkish Coast Guard [apprehended](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1717491401686634) a boat off Cesme\. Boats leaving from there usually arrive on Chios \(sometimes South Lesvos\) \. This comes along with reports that people of the Villa hotel, which was attacked recently, are afraid to leave the building in fear of other attacks, InfoMigrants [adds](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/15851/greece-asylum-seekers-afraid-to-leave-hotel-after-being-attacked-by-locals?fbclid=IwAR0-NRPna2VjPchDxEvaqmzSPGpOtPtVt8lVPhrbTX-aF1rMKB9ye-jF39w) \. In another recent incident, an interpreter of the Greek Council for Refugees has been attacked\.


Following attacks on people seeking protection in the Attica region and on Samos, Greece’s Supreme Court prosecutor ordered to investigate the incidents\. Greekreporter [writes](https://greece.greekreporter.com/2019/03/21/greek-supreme-court-orders-investigation-of-racist-incidents-involving-refugees/?fbclid=IwAR3XWzM8-6uydvhMWvFHieGa3lVoo7ynD_cGu3nD_CZCuuKVuglqpD2qWFU) that this investigation should discern whether the attacks were racially motivated and which charges can be expected against the attackers\.

To be prepared for another hot summer, Movement On The Ground is already [collecting](https://www.facebook.com/movementontheground/photos/a.563378670505116/1328836663959309/?type=3&theater&hc_location=ufi) items to tackle this period\. For this, the group is asking for Mosquito repellants, flip\-flops, electric fans, and a possibility to build cooling spots in the camp\.
### Croatia

Asylum in Europe updated its country report for Croatia\. According to data from the Interior Ministry, Croatia received 1068 intentions to apply for asylum, and 916 applications were lodged\. However, it is not explained why 225 people received a refugee status \(mainly Syrians\), 21 subsidiary protection, 186 a rejection: a total of only 432 decisions\. A total of 150 applications were still pending at the end of the year\. Among the top five nationalities was Algeria, and by now all decisions were negative\.

### France

The Refugee Women’s Centre is [asking](https://www.facebook.com/refugeewomenscentre/posts/602917496800551) for tents and sleeping bags, blankets and tarpaulins\. “There are around 280 individuals sleeping outside the temporary winter shelter in Grande Synthe, and 6 families including 8 children,” the RWC writes\. As the state’s obligation to provide accomodation to families in winter ends by the end of the month, up to 600 people are expected to be without a place to sleep\. If you can support, please write an E\-Mail to supportus@refugeewomenscentre\.com\.

The situation in Paris is similar as many people are left on the streets without appropiate shelter\. Hence, Solidarité migrants Wilson [needs](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1099381626929275&id=598228360377940) blankets to supply the people in Avenue Wilson\. As the police harassment continues like always, it is a circle of distributing, confiscating/evicting, \(re\- \)collecting, and once again distributing essential items\.
