#### FEATURE

There are currently repeated reports coming through that the violations of the Moroccan authorities against sub\-Saharan migrants have reached unbearable limits\.


![“ A day of arrest of migrants in nador\. In the streets, the auxiliary forces and authority officers arrested several sub\-Saharan migrants among them women who did nothing wrong except that they were black\.”](assets/25cc8d0c81b9/1*vv7QNRB3Hlci9eBiXqoBbg.jpeg)

“ A day of arrest of migrants in nador\. In the streets, the auxiliary forces and authority officers arrested several sub\-Saharan migrants among them women who did nothing wrong except that they were black\.”


> Today, people in civilian clothes, who are neither police, nor the army, nor even members of the auxiliary forces, have arrested dozens of migrants in Nador\. They tried even to arrest our colleague Abdoulay who is a community agent, who has his residence card, and who works legally in Nador\. 





Thus, it is safe to say these attacks are racially motivated and directed against the potential refugees and migrants\.

Listen to his testimony:

Ours and their full solidarity with Aboubakar\.

According to these reports, nearly 500 migrants were arrested, women with their children included, but also asylum seekers who have submitted their asylum applications in Morocco\.


> 6 refoulement bus came out of Nador for now\. While the authorities have kept simple migrants in detention to charge them of being traffickers\.
 

> A known game that must be unmasked\.
 

> The great traffickers are still running, while migrants who get arrested in forest or on the street are presented as great smugglers\. 




### Libya

Journalist Sally Hayden reports that a group from Khoms has been deported to Sebha detention center in Tripoli\. “It’s not clear why they were moved, & obviously it’s distressing for detainees when this happens at night without them feeling they can trust the Libyan authorities moving them,” she writes on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sallyhayd/status/1093765873154826240) \. For the [Time](http://time.com/5510517/facebook-smuggling-libya-ransoms/) she also wrote an article about families raising money on Facebook to free their relatives held hostage by smugglers\.

### Greece

The land route of Greece and Turkey through the Evros river still seems to be in use, according to AYS information\. As the Diavata camp is overcrowded, a new makeshift camp popped up close to the central station of Thessaloniki\. Several people have reported that they have been denied access to official reception facilities for months\. Conditions have also been reported to be very poor in the Diavata camp\.

### Netherlands

In its newsletter, ECRI writes about the current development in Dutch interior politics: The government announced to examine the cases of 700 children and their families, who had made use of the “children’s pardon” scheme, which is about to be scrapped\. Families, whose asylum cases hadn’t been processed for five years or longer, were eligible to apply for this kind of residence permit\. “There will be a transitional arrangement for families that have been here for five years or longer, but have not made any application for the children’s pardon before,” ECRI writes\. At the same time, the government wants to relocate 500 instead of 750 people from UNHCR refugee camps in war zones\.

In a letter sent to prime minister Giuseppe Conte, she urged the government to prioritize Human Rights over disagreements with other countries\.
