The Italian coast guard recovered the bodies of two infants, aged one and two years old, last Friday\. Disabled by an explosion in waters off Malta, 36 survivors from a boat carrying 40 individuals have now been rescued and taken to Lampedusa\. One woman remains missing\. The cause of death is thought to be severe burns\.

#### SEARCH AND RESCUE \(SAR\)
#### 400 people‚Äôs lives are currently at risk off Sicily


The SAR zone around the Mediterranean is scarily going to become even more active in the coming months\. Aegean Boat Report has recently reported on a worrying trend: an increase in larger boats travelling from Turkey and Lebanon directly towards Italy\. Longer journeys in overcrowded sailboats are lethally dangerous, and several large\-scale shipwrecks have already occurred\.
#### 34 people rescued during the night by Ocean Viking

Chief prosecutor Ivan Geshev says of the state of migration in Bulgaria that:


> ‚ÄúHospitals in Burgas are full of unidentified dead persons that hunters find in the forest\. They cannot be released because their identities cannot be established _\.‚Äù_ 





The district‚Äôs only forensic doctor, Dr\. Galina Mileva, has commented upon this horrifying reality:

‚Äú _There is a huge refugee flow, not only as migrants across the Turkish border, but also Ukrainians\. We have many Ukrainians who died here\. The relatives of some of them are ready to carry out their funerals here\. However, others remain in the morgue, unclaimed\. \[‚Ä¶\] A new storage cabinet for storing corpses should be purchased_ \.‚Äù
#### ROMANIA
#### Violence on the Romanian border ‚Äî ‚ÄúThey sent dogs to bite us‚Äù

No Name Kitchen have published a recent testimony from the Romanian/Serbian border:


> ‚ÄúJ\. and his cousins have been in Serbia for 22 days and this morning was the fifteenth time they have tried to cross the Serbian border into the European Union\. 





> Since the third time they have changed places several times, so impossible it seemed that they would be able to cross again at the same place\. ‚Äú 





> Every time we went to a new spot I hoped they wouldn‚Äôt beat me even more, but I wasn‚Äôt right\. 





> Even worse, every time they tried ‚Äúgame over my friend‚Äù once law enforcement caught them before they beat them and tortured them in various ways\. 





> ‚ÄúAfter the dogs bit us, they hit us with bamboo and sticks and destroyed our phones\. They also took my power bank and all my money\.‚Äù J\. is desperate and does not know what to do\. ‚ÄúI thought Romanian police was nicer than Hungarians, but in the end all of them are horrible and not human\.‚Äù 





> J\. left Syria 6 years ago and lived until the beginning of the year in Turkey to earn money to be able to continue his dangerous trip towards Europe\.‚Äù

#### SERBIA

Until a few days ago, Serbia had ‚Äòno\-visa‚Äô relationships with Tunisia, Burundi, India and Cuba ‚Äî travel between these nations was visa free\. However, threatened with sanctions by the EU, who cynically accused Serbia of ‚Äòproducing‚Äô refugees and conjuring up a crisis, Serbia has now ended its no\-visa relations with Tunisia and Burundi\.

Serbian Centre for Development of Social Policies and NGO, KlikAktiv, offers [a counter narrative from on\-the\-ground experience over the past year\.](https://www.facebook.com/klikaktiv/posts/pfbid0DU1RhqjLBHTX4SbDfAih1849b4JSWYUHhXpj8eXqwN1RSnB3jkafk7DCeamRt6wYl) According to KlikAktiv, 70% of the individuals with whom they have worked in Serbia are from Syria and Afghanistan\. People from no\-visa states make up only 19% of the refugee population in Serbia \(14\.5% Tunisian, 2\.6% Indian, 1\.7% Burundi\) \. The no\-visa relationships Serbia had have become a scapegoat, an example of the EU finding external culprits to blame, and so exonerate itself from responsibility\.

The Western Balkans route has seen an increase in footfall this year, a 170% increase on 2021 according to [Frontex](https://frontex.europa.eu/media-centre/news/news-release/eu-external-borders-in-september-vlgp1C) , who have recorded 106,396 so\-called ‚Äòirregular crossings‚Äô by September this year\. EU Commissioner Ylva Johansson has publicly scapegoated Serbia, suggesting ‚Äúbig, big numbers‚Äù of people came from Burundi, Cuba and India\. KlikAktiv reality check this claim\. Calling for Serbia to align its visa agreements with Europe, the EU again cite ‚Äòsecurity‚Äô concerns as paramount: [‚ÄúWe want to see practical results and progress in this field because it‚Äôs necessary for the security of EU citizens‚Äù\.](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2022/10/14/eu-sounds-the-alarm-over-rise-in-illegal-border-crossings-via-serbia-and-abuse-of-visa-fre?fbclid=IwAR2XxSXliA6UkRBNHDsMMZllWblevqKgxjNX6Fq5h6opCjrPdMyPIs1MJqk)
#### LEBANON
#### Poverty rate amongst Palestinian refugees in Lebanon reaches 93%

UNRWA urgently appeals for US $13 million to provide urgent assistance to Palestinians in Lebanon\. 162,000 Palestinians \(of an estimated refugee population of 180,000\) have already received cash assistance from UNRWA this year\.

As Lebanon‚Äôs economic meltdown ‚Äî slashing access to clean water and putting extra strain on hospitals ‚Äî continues, the situation has become increasingly desperate\.


> ‚ÄúAlmost every Palestine refugee in Lebanon lives in poverty\. The average cost of the food basket has increased six\-fold in the last year one of the highest increases the world has recorded this year\. The cost of water, fuel, electricity, gas, transport and health care is now three to five times higher\. Medicines are increasingly unavailable on the market and families are unable to afford them since government subsidies have been lifted\. Too many Palestinian refugee families are no longer able to afford secondary health care\. Some are skipping lifesaving treatment to avoid accumulating debts\.‚Äù 





[Iman, a mother of three living in Mar Elias camp, told UNRWA](https://reliefweb.int/report/lebanon/hitting-rock-bottom-palestine-refugees-lebanon-risk-their-lives-search-dignity-enar?fbclid=IwAR36F2-iWFSyh03Ui-9243u-x25EG3pdtW0xckqwSFY9PAq4UTFP2eMgjUY) : _‚ÄúDying from poverty will not be much different from dying at sea\. Life in Lebanon has become unbearable with one crisis after another\. Youth are those seeking to emigrate to escape this reality though entire families are now selling everything and risking their lives just to have a decent life_ \.‚Äù

#### Cholera outbreak in Qub Elias, Lebanon

With no cases of cholera for the last 30 years, an outbreak in October now numbers 220 cases and five deaths\. Typically spread through contaminated water, food and sewage, the outbreak that began in Afghanistan in June has spread through Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Syria and now Lebanon\.

Most [reported cases](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/cholera-outbreak-hits-syrian-refugees-sheltering-camps-lebanon-2022-10-21/?fbclid=IwAR2P7EcqHwxhZJguo92M1sZiXUTpm_0ZpN3KVa-gJemexAmnZK_8YBR_YFU) in Lebanon have been in refugee camps, where health conditions are the most dire\.
#### FRONTEX
#### 345 MEPs refuse to approve Frontex‚Äôs budget over OLAF report\!

This is a massive victory for transparency against an agency complicit in illegal pushbacks, silencing whistleblowers, violating human rights and manipulating internal reports\.

People are being driven to border crossing points in northern Syria and forced across at gun point\.

Nadia Hardman writes that _‚Äúit now looks like Turkey is trying to make northern Syria a refugee dumping ground_ \.‚Äù

Human Rights Watch is calling for the **EU to recognise that Turkey is unsafe for Asylum Seekers** , especially as it seems likely to normalise relations with the Bashar al\-Assad government\.

Afghan refugees in Turkey, already exploited by employers and lacking access to public services, are coming under increased threat of detention and/or deportation to Iran\. Tensions with locals are increasing, and Istanbul‚Äôs major districts are no longer able to issue residence permits to foreign nationals\.

Sara Creta reports that, in the wake off pushbacks, people are turning to smuggling networks\. Using luxury sailboats, smugglers are crossing to Italy and are making as much as ‚Ç¨500,000 per trip\. She reports that an adult would expect to pay ‚Ç¨8,500 and a child ‚Ç¨4000\.


> ‚ÄúThese sailboats are typically operated by Ukrainian and Russian smugglers working together with the Turkish mobsters and Italian clans _\.‚Äù_

#### Rising poverty in Greece is a threat to refugees and migrants too

30% of the Greek population are currently at risk of descending below the poverty line, and concurrently more and more people on the move find themselves on the streets without shelter\. Dependence on soup kitchens and solidarity networks is increasing, piling pressure on local activists and organisers too\.

RSA has produced a mini\-documentary, following four Afghan families who collect cartons from rubbish bins to survive\.


> The camera follows them during a day of their work while they narrate the difficulties they face\. It is the lack of welfare support and the threat to remain homeless that drives those people on the streets: elderly and sick, women and men alike\. In the midst of the traffic noise they pull and push with their bare hands their little trolleys day by day through Athens, just to earn about 10 Cents per kilo of carton\.

**The excuse of ‚Äònational security‚Äô ‚Äî justifying the baseless revocation of asylum**

Two Syrian activists in Greece, Wael and Karim, have had their asylum revoked\. Founders of the Syrian and Greek Youth Forum, a creative activism movement seeking to break stereotypes of refugees in Athens, neither have criminal records\. As they challenge the legal process, despite being denied access to the classified documents that ‚Äòjustify‚Äô their revoked asylum statuses, both are seeking a calm and co\-operative solution\.

We understood that\. What we experienced in Greece was a great experience and we want to share it with others\. Let‚Äôs say that we are happy that we are all together\.
