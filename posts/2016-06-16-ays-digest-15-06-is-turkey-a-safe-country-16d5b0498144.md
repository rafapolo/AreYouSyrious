### EU tries to bury report on Turkey migrant returns

The [EU Observer](https://euobserver.com/migration/133836) says that members of the EASO management board, which includes EU commission staff and representatives from EU member states, are unhappy with EASO’s efforts to determine if Turkey is a safe third country\. It adds that board members argue this effort is not part of EASO’s mandate, while UK members of the board have objected to the EASO probe and are now writing an independent report\. A Greek appeals committee in Lesvos has already determined that Turkey is not safe enough for nine Syrian refugees facing deportation\.
### Asylum\-seekers challenge EU\-Turkey deal

[The Express](http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/679768/EU-Turkey-refugee-deal-migrant-crisis-European-court) claims three asylum\-seekers have challenged the European Union’s refugee deal with Turkey in the European Court of Justice\. The trio, currently in Greece, has argued Turkey is not a safe place for refugees and filed a complaint to the Luxembourg\-based court last week\. Their complaint also argues that the Greek asylum system has “serious flaws at all levels”\. The move risks derailing the fragile EU\-Turkey deal which has already come under threat due to strained EU\-Turkish relations\.

Meanwhile, the [Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/no-visa-free-travel-for-turkey-by-month-end-says-eu-executive-1466005430) says the European Commission has confirmed Turkey has not met the conditions for visa liberalisation, judging that insufficient progress has been made on seven key criteria, including revisions to anti\-terror legislation\. It also says that on average, only 47 migrants had arrived each day in Greece from Turkey over the past month\.
### Number of relocations increases to 2,280

The European Commission said during its latest progress report that the number of relocations has increased to 2,280, noting that the rate had almost doubled since the previous report on May 18\. It added that “despite the positive signs, progress is still too slow\. Action must be accelerated to avoid migrants returning to irregular routes”\.
#### Turkey

**462 people sent back to Turkey**

A Turkish official says the EU\-Turkey deal has led to a “ sharp decline in irregular crossings” and 462 people have been sent back from the Greek islands back to Turkey\. Under the same deal, 508 Syrians who were living in Turkish refugee camps have been relocated to Europe since April 1\.
#### Greece
### 70 appeals granted by Greek Appeal Committees

By 12 June 2016, of the 1,429 asylum applications submitted by persons who crossed from Turkey into Greek islands as from 20 March 2016, 267 were declared inadmissible by the Greek Asylum Service\. 252 appeals have been lodged against these decisions before the Greek Appeal Committees which had taken 70 decisions granting the appeal and 2 decisions rejecting the appeal\.
### 800 refugees granted asylum

Die Zeit says that 800 refugees were granted asylum in the past few weeks in Greece, with most judges arguing that Turkey is not a safe country for refugees\. Most of those being granted asylum are either sick or are Syrian women and children that will be reunited with their family\.
### Successful pre\-registration in Cherso

According to AYS volunteers on site, yesterday UNHCR was able to register 1,568 refugees in only three hours in a “good atmosphere”, and plans on registering the rest today\. One refugee however said that problems could arise once people who are not in the camp but are accommodated nearby start arriving\. UNHCR has allegedly requested that families accommodated nearby come the camp this morning \(16\.6\.2016\. \), as registration is almost complete and should end at 15:00\.

### Update on BP and Hara

BP station and Hara are now empty, but allegedly some people are hiding in the surrounding area as they are unwilling to go to official camps\. Some people who were evicted from BP and Hara and moved to the official Vasilika camp have apparently moved back and installed new independent camps near BP station\. A coordinator for ‘Mums without borders’ says many kids and pregnant women were at Eko station and are now in camps with bad living conditions\.

### Hope Centre Elpis forced to close

The Licensing Committee in Lesvos has forbidden the Elpis Hotel site to be used for assisting refugees and has sued the Hope Centre volunteers for 10,000 Euros, accusing them of running a hotel without a licence\. The hotel needs to be emptied until the 27th of June and help is needed to redistribute aid to other volunteer groups\.
### Volunteers needed

### 1,800 refugees in transit

[Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-serbia-hungary-idUSKCN0Z01Q8) says that according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the number of migrants in transit through Serbia has doubled to 1,800 this week from 900 a month ago\. While Balkan borders remain closed to migrants, aid workers warn that most of those 1,800 will put themselves in the hands of smugglers, while a few hundred wait patiently to be allowed to enter Hungary legally\. Hungary lets 30 refugees into the country daily, mostly families from conflict zones\. According to the Serbian government, 500 people, half of them children, are living in makeshift camps at two border crossings between Serbia and Hungary, in what are described as transit zones

### 9 out of 10 children arrive to Europe unaccompanied

Unicef says unaccompanied children made out 92% of the 7,567 children that left North Africa for Europe between January and May 2016, two times more than during the same period last year\. In its report ‘danger every step of the way’, Unicef also warns of the dangers these children are facing, including forced labour, beatings or death\.

### Refugee crisis in Paris

Despite the recent evacuation of a camp, a new one has already been created near the La Chapelle metro station\. Another group is camping in front of the offices of the “France Terre d’Asile” association, hoping that they will be able to make an appointment that will speed up their claim for asylum\. The number of refugees is rising everyday and will soon reach the size of the previous camps\. The unusual temperatures for this season complicates the refugees’ situation even more\.
