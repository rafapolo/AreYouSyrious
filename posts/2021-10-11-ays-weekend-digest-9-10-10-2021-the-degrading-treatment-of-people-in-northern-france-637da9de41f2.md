_Human Rights Watch_ have released a report entitled [_The Degrading Treatment of Migrant Children and Adults in Northern France_](https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/10/07/enforced-misery/degrading-treatment-migrant-children-and-adults-northern-france?fbclid=IwAR2zn46HjYtNft9dfqhxfT0enYjnnBMEV7xHgHP3I-J-jH40NjYilNJCDbk#_ftn24) which describes how people are treated in northern France\. They recorded more than 90 evictions of the areas where people have tents between January 2020 and July 2021\. This accounts for 9 out of 10 evictions carried out in the whole of France\.


> _“ primary purpose of forcing people to move elsewhere and do not serve to resolve people’s migration or housing status\.”_ 





Several NGO workers were interviewed as part of the making of the report, who described police checks of volunteers and vehicles whilst in the act of attempting to support people with water, food or other essential services\. The report also claims that the CRS \(the police unit responsible for matters relating to people\-on\-the\-move\) abused coronavirus restriction laws in order to hinder the work of NGOs\. This despite the NGOs having permission and paperwork to approve their essential work\.

The report also offers solutions to changing the situation — these include:
- Providing safe and legal routes for people to reach the UK
- Waiving the Dublin agreement, whereby people risk being deported to the country which they first entered the European Union \(usually Italy or Greece\)
- Ensuring that people are not deprived of essential services such as access to water
- The police to coordinate with other organisations to provide safety and support for unaccompanied minors\.


The emphasis of the report is highlighting the current situation, whilst also providing a variety of ways in which improvements could be made by various authorities\. 60 people\-on\-the\-move were interviewed for the report, including 40 unaccompanied minors\.

**10 people reported dead off the coast of Gran Canaria**

_El Diario_ reports on the sad [death of 10 people](https://www-eldiario-es.translate.goog/canariasahora/migraciones/mueren-diez-personas-bordo-patera-sur-gran-canaria_1_8382982.html?fbclid=IwAR1sA9-BS8Ztv45PvWS8n6nsqeS-cExBlJKTZVRQCRH55vVNIxvnwArzRdM&_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-GB&_x_tr_pto=nui) who were on board a boat that was lost on Friday night\. The boat was over 150 km from Gran Canaria when it was found the next day\. A further 24 people were rescued by helicopter due to severe health conditions\.

Additionally, [a further 40 people](https://www.eldiario.es/canariasahora/migraciones/salvamento-maritimo-rescata-patera-40-subsaharianos-seis-millas-maspalomas_1_8385414.html?fbclid=IwAR2X30v0pxJ7hoD362hK6rKZvJRBzW1oKhx_y1Zd2yI-hVynVGbaEz2JXQ4) were discovered in a dinghy 6 miles from Gran Canaria on Sunday evening\. Among them were women and babies\. They were taken to the port of Arguineguín\.

59 people were rescued from the **Mediterranean** on Sunday\. They are from Syria, Etiopia, Eritrea, Egitto, Nigeria, Somalia and Sudan\.

77 people were taken to the Italian [port of Crotone](https://www.wesud.it/migranti-in-77-sbarcano-al-porto-di-crotone-erano-a-bordo-di-un-barcone-intercettato-dalla-guardia-costiera/?fbclid=IwAR2MwsQLc9VDa_t5SpAcdC7fctbd4jB3iJnDnknJE3WKclzJxeIzMd1nb48) \. On board were 14 women and 19 children\.

Also in Italian waters, two children and a woman were [among 20 people rescued](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.grandangoloagrigento.it%2Fprimo-piano%2Fmigranti-in-20-sbarcati-nella-notte-a-lampedusa%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2is6AejMpXs4h3b6jzVb4hhhbE1CsCX5kbWODwjj5tXbBMFKtkh5alXQQ&h=AT2EwcgrV_I3MKfHynUXFkFmdqG66m4tuca3jsfVfHX_uqJ_uZ4GTCueDwOpOEkfX1hAhyVip7sTmcln_sdjYqvIJDitczmBQHEX4teIz2nUdl7MF5tVb0gzRwMFmCVwKXByFTK2IuMdOQ&__tn__=R]-R&c[0]=AT0wgcy2P1xkONmwpoeTq1YKYi2Xt_LyL4K7f4vY4aBwFtD3apXazbEFJdF44Vh6XgJvuHalhM2BClOGkXPATfjyI-WQR6_HhKoeErWPRADmJXcbwmxhoVA1xeOn5R_rjSXOaT08_HqPeMH0w7A0GCilX8zQK50lKw5ZnClE59VW44OQZtXljkZ07aQ-2NTih2ghD18c2YuMhttps://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.grandangoloagrigento.it%2Fprimo-piano%2Fmigranti-in-20-sbarcati-nella-notte-a-lampedusa%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2is6AejMpXs4h3b6jzVb4hhhbE1CsCX5kbWODwjj5tXbBMFKtkh5alXQQ&h=AT2EwcgrV_I3MKfHynUXFkFmdqG66m4tuca3jsfVfHX_uqJ_uZ4GTCueDwOpOEkfX1hAhyVip7sTmcln_sdjYqvIJDitczmBQHEX4teIz2nUdl7MF5tVb0gzRwMFmCVwKXByFTK2IuMdOQ&__tn__=R]-R&c[0]=AT0wgcy2P1xkONmwpoeTq1YKYi2Xt_LyL4K7f4vY4aBwFtD3apXazbEFJdF44Vh6XgJvuHalhM2BClOGkXPATfjyI-WQR6_HhKoeErWPRADmJXcbwmxhoVA1xeOn5R_rjSXOaT08_HqPeMH0w7A0GCilX8zQK50lKw5ZnClE59VW44OQZtXljkZ07aQ-2NTih2ghD18c2YuM) and brought to Lampedusa\. They were 11 miles off shore\.

Watch as **[Sea\-Watch 3](https://www.grandangoloagrigento.it/primo-piano/migranti-in-20-sbarcati-nella-notte-a-lampedusa?fbclid=IwAR2is6AejMpXs4h3b6jzVb4hhhbE1CsCX5kbWODwjj5tXbBMFKtkh5alXQQ)** once again takes to the waters\.

Further discussion of the illegal pushbacks used by the **Greek coast guard** have been [highlighted](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=411994843635077&id=100044736951768) by Gerhard Trabert\. He calls on the EU to recognise the criminal acts of coast guard pushbacks\.


> _“New arrivals are quickly returned to the sea, in inflatable boats, the hands of the refugees are often tied behind them, and then the inflatable boat is released towards Turkey… If someone falls overboard, they will inevitably drown with their hands tied up\.”_ 




### GREECE

**Greek army division letter: requests not to ‘hunt refugees’**

[A letter of complaint](http://diktiospartakos.blogspot.com/2021/10/71.html) was sent from army division 71st Airborne Brigade asking not to be sent to ‘hunt refugees in Evros’\.

_“They demand an end to the Missions in Evros and the involvement of the 71st Airborne Brigade in the hunt for refugee\-immigrants\.”_

Also concerning Evros, Citizen Protection Minister Takis Theodorikakos [made a speech](https://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2021/10/10/greece-evros-border-guards-fence/) during his visit to the Evros region, defending the need to extend the current border fence\. 37km of fencing has already been completed\. [This video series](https://www.npostart.nl/frontlinie/21-06-2021/VPWON_1319351) by Dutch documentary\-makers looks at the wall being built at the border\.

The International Rescue Committee [has raised concerns](https://www.rescue.org/press-release/world-mental-health-day-refugees-greece-are-more-vulnerable-ever-plans-closed?fbclid=IwAR1x8Pn1z1ibggLRUpfhgTQ8is27OPHt-lxcLmMFhoSgxd9JPM-vJPx1b5g) over the mental health of those held on the Greek islands\. 4,000 asylum seekers are in temporary camps whilst the construction of remote and permanent facilities are going ahead on the islands of Chios and Lesvos\.

_“\[The residents\] will be under constant surveillance by CCTV and video monitors, drones, alarms with cameras and control gates with metal detectors and x\-ray devices\.”_

Of 170 evaluations carried out on children in the camps, 40 needed urgent psychological intervention\.

[Former Afghan politicians](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/10/8/evacuated-afghan-politicians-plan-advocacy-for-womens-rights?fbclid=IwAR24rqqvsoMIYaphmfpWITFWI0B_3BQuLu5XTf7-2O4QLgV7yvSKyYUeA0c) who were evacuated to Greece call for a plan for women’s rights in Afghanistan\. The women and their families, who held positions in the Afghan government, tell how they hid and eventually escaped the Taliban thanks to the hard work of local NGOs Melissa Network and Human Rights 360\.

[This Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/lk2015r/status/1446804918686322688?fbclid=IwAR3j15SAV3Jc66VLSavpN7eimzHOKtYaxWkCwXWuvdwKBexl-81i8kQwH_4) discusses the importance for journalists and activists to engage with older material about pushbacks\. Information is available from 2007 on behaviour patterns of pushbacks\.
### BOSNIA HERZEGOVINA

**Call for equal assistance for Afghan refugees in BiH**

![](assets/637da9de41f2/0*fwEYAWadhEI6Hni2)


There has been a call for all refugees from Afghanistan to be given asylum in the Balkans\. The call comes from [TRANSBALKANSKA SOLIDARNOST](https://transbalkanskasolidarnost.home.blog/azil-za-izbjegle-iz-afganistana-na-balkanu-bez-iznimke/?fbclid=IwAR18FfjoLANx-OLtbxxK1DIeH0myDEeaj6xSZ8Ohqs06-2Yxd-WOYQ7aQYc) who point out the contradictory messages and standards portrayed by western countries\. Whilst some people from Afghanistan were airlifted to safety, others are left to suffer at the borders of the EU\.


> _“It is unacceptable for European governments to deepen the humanitarian crisis for Afghans — and other refugees — now with horror scenes from that country, but also inhumane conditions in the jungles and “camps” in the Balkans, on the eve of colder and more dangerous weather\.”_ 





Words of a woman from Afghanistan tells the reality of the situation, of attempting to cross the border with children, and eventually of being illegally pushed back\.

The continued treatment of **Aryan** — a man from Iran who is in a wheelchair and currently in Northern Bosnia [is highlighted by Amir Labbaf](https://www.facebook.com/amir121121/posts/893514594926503) , himself a refugee from Iran\. Aryan has been moved against his will from a camp in the city of Bihac to Lipa Camp — a mountain top encampment more than 20km from the city\. The conditions of the camp are well documented, and not favourably\. Aryan has now been taken, against his will, to a camp in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo\.
### SPAIN

**Spainish Interior Minister addresses ‘instrumentalisation’ of migrants**

Spanish Interior Minister Fernando Grande\-Marlaska has spoken at a meeting of all EU Interior Ministers\. He requested that migration not be spoken of as a “ [problem, but as a challenge](https://www.europapress.es/nacional/noticia-marlaska-defiende-marruecos-no-instrumentaliza-migracion-presionar-ue-20211008102352.html?fbclid=IwAR1fJjKUAb_ynwDGverGDcp8KulVqf8LSLsTyZclVUo8ybAgp21thu1BYuk) ”\.

This comment comes as ministers discuss the “instrumentalisation” of refugees and asylum seekers by both Belarus and Morocco, both of whom are using vulnerable people as weapons to put pressure on the European Union\. Marlaska also called on all member states to share responsibility and solidarity with Spain, Italy, Greece, Cyrus and Malta who carry the heaviest burden in relation to people entering the EU\.
### FRANCE

**Call for volunteers**

A continued call for volunteers has been issued by [Solidarité migrants Wilson](https://www.facebook.com/Solidarit%C3%A9-migrants-Wilson-598228360377940/?__cft__[0]=AZUDMUrf2Ab40dua3fiO5VR2-qFBgAqct-JDaQOd_54Kj-ZzX3S-1fjziZRjrdJqK10KAEgXoRTQb80VTti_Sgx2Jhg_Fas2IxeCKXDUnY2FKeNtP6sNWbfkGzAMmvh0gghmspU-F-SHeRZKVtaGxkDp&__tn__=-UC%2CP-R) to cook and distribute meals\.

There will be a concert in support of the work of Utopia 56 in Paris on 30th October\. Full [information available here](https://www.facebook.com/U56ParisIDF/) and have a [sneak preview here](http://facebook.com/watch/?v=901805487381961) \.
### GERMANY

**Frankfurt declared ‘safe haven’\.**

![](assets/637da9de41f2/0*y8r6Dv8O9C-_RaVJ)


Frankfurt am Main has declared itself a [Safe Haven](https://www.facebook.com/SeebrueckeSchafftsichereHaefen/posts/1492085677830277) for refugees\. This has happened thanks to campaigning by local groups and NGO Seebrücke [offers support](https://www.facebook.com/SeebrueckeSchafftsichereHaefen/) for campaigners to make their city into a safe haven too\.

DENMARK

**Third\-country reception centre**

The possibility of a [third\-country reception centre](https://jyllands-posten.dk/indland/ECE13326989/i-aarevis-har-regeringen-talt-om-et-modtagecenter-uden-for-europa-nu-viser-det-sig-at-der-er-dialog-med-ukraine/) has been raised\. Denmark is in conversation with Ukraine about the possibility of a reception centre outside of the EU\. Ukraine rejects these negotiations and Danish People’s Party and the Unity List raise criticism\.

UNITED KINGDOM

**UK fails to pay France £55 million**

[1,100 people arrived in the UK](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/oct/10/1100-migrants-cross-channel-small-boats-uk-two-days?fbclid=IwAR1Pi5HB1YQW3wOxMHj5BWtvPtMFARe_8RA9Xq-7s_TlBukmIiKjVcPSANc) via small boats on Friday and Saturday\. At least 40 boats landed in 2 days, following a period of 10 days when crossings weren’t possible\. This comes amidst accusations from the French government that the UK haven’t paid a single euro of the £55 million promised in order to prevent these crossings\. UK border forces [have been observed](https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/news/as-uk-plans-to-pushback-migrants-it-fails-to-pay-france-millions-promised-to-tackle-channel-crossings-294476/?fbclid=IwAR1i0SldgK3vG20Iz7aMoSR33XOvKJjMXNlNomE6K4n2udsbjdjY2xp7r2w) practising pushback techniques using jetskis\.

The UK Home Office will be holding [7,000 refugees from Afghanistan](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/09/afghan-refugees-uk-hotels-operation-warm-welcome?fbclid=IwAR1sA9-BS8Ztv45PvWS8n6nsqeS-cExBlJKTZVRQCRH55vVNIxvnwArzRdM) in temporary accommodation in hotels for ‘months’\. Due to housing shortages, those who were evacuated from Kabul have been residing in hotels with little access to health care, or any independence, since August\. One man was quoted as wanting to return to Afghanistan rather than live in a hotel room\.

Additionally, the Home Office has wasted £3 million on plans and construction of an asylum camp that was never used\. The Yarls Wood site was described by [the Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/home-office-yarls-wood-camp-asylum-priti-patel-b1934294.html?fbclid=IwAR3BKYM9i7zrBVm8cjNQ87sFw7vZ2VfOKP85n0u2XjRX3H0LoYFRlRnQ_4Q) as ‘prison\-like’\.

[This article by an anonymous](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/08/home-office-refugees-asylum-claims-pressure-staff?fbclid=IwAR3lerCndz1XS0oI8pDCA8jN9vzk3SFPcAEBN4CxsOS337qNg8NJG6IXvLs) Home Office employee describes the stresses on staff which result in the failing of the asylum system\.

“During my recent time as a decision\-maker, my colleagues and I were subjected to unreasonable management pressures that made it increasingly difficult for staff to consistently uphold their duty of care to claimants or make correct decisions in asylum cases\.”

A series of extremely informative info graphics has been re\-released by Josoor to help us all better understand terminology and facts about illegal pushbacks\. [See the full deck here\.](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.josoor.net%2Fpost%2Finfo-series-1-pushbacks%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR3YN2ctIUimwWCDSGfR4X4YSRAFIVSFBT6CrqHXqOzyAa-ycb7rBY_geVs&h=AT1TnxTL15mxkGQc-4COWuSjSyM-D98k1d4AbtlucuSmnvxIdceK5M61MSSZCQWxnaftg9KF0Rbe1psZJoyV-h7r9_LhnzA5-y9wWnjlWVb3FUAg4MN2EQu-IhQf-PXCoQ&__tn__=-UK-R&c[0]=AT1GTn8Fzwsfhs8eNIzuq6VUfDdM3nXEnjQgZMjaT6TBfavOGzVqk1QTkc0e9Xr7ZFEDETzI6COV1pWNPMHDIHLXn0Nx3bcm6yAHLBrxFPd2bUQU_T6xpzHw5wTRX35vvkuzAlnwXOfXn58wtq0IO5I8FBPScNe_V1_Ec1zWJoaNN6s)

Italy and Malta both withdrew rescue operations, citing that their shores were ‘unsafe’ for arrivals\.

The use and potential mis\-use of biometric data collection by humanitarian organisations is the subject of [this article by BiometricUpdate](https://www.biometricupdate.com/202110/you-cannot-trust-a-vendor-understanding-biometrics-in-the-humanitarian-sector?fbclid=IwAR1Pi5HB1YQW3wOxMHj5BWtvPtMFARe_8RA9Xq-7s_TlBukmIiKjVcPSANc) \. “The technology itself is neutral, but the way it is used and, critically, how much data is collected are key issues for any sector\.”
