#### FEATURED

On May 5, Kheiraldin, Abdallah and Mohamad — survivors of the shipwreck that took place near Paros island on Christmas Eve — were sentenced to a total of 439 years in prison by a Greek court on Syros island\.

Kheiraldin was sentenced to 187 years as the “captain”, Abdallah and Mohamad each to 126 as the “mechanic” and the “assistant”\. Even though the court, who acknowledged that they are not smugglers that acted for profit, dropped the charges of “being part of a criminal organization” and did not impose life sentences, the three fathers were still convicted for “facilitating unauthorized entry”\. In the case of Kheiraldin, he tried three times to reach Greece by land but was turned back each time by EU border guards, which led him to take the boat, states Borderline Europe\.

Despite the fact that a court expert testified that not smugglers but refugees steer boats to escape to the EU, and whilst the prosecutions only witness didn’t show up, a scandalous sentence was still passed, says Mare Liberum\.

A group of 40 Syrians who have been pushed back twice and who had been stuck in a violent crossfire between Greek and Turkish border guards on the island of Evros, describe in [EfSyn newspaper](https://www.efsyn.gr/ellada/dikaiomata/342610_prosfyges-se-diastayroymena-pyra-stis-nisides-toy-ebroy) how they’ve been tortured by the Greek guards\.

The group finally crossed the Greek border for the third time on Friday, May 6\. Together with a group of 14 Palestinians, they filed for interim measures at [the European Court for Human Rights \(ECtHR\), which has already approved five of them](https://www.gcr.gr/en/news/press-releases-announcements/item/1962-the-european-court-for-human-rights-ecthr-grants-interim-measures-for-5th-group-of-syrian-refugees-stranded-on-an-islet-in-the-evros-river) \. The latest one is awaiting approval\.

The Court has ordered the Greek government not to remove the refugees from the country’s territory and to provide them with food, water and proper medical care\. According to EfSyn newspaper, the Prosecutor of Orestiada has instructed the Orestiada Police Directorate to conduct an operation to locate the refugees, and to ensure that they are included in the legal reception and asylum procedures\.

In striking contrast to this reality, UNHCR has evaluated the camp in Preševo as adequate in terms of shelter, hygiene, level of privacy, medical treatment, and security in a [report](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/documents/details/89400) on camps in Serbia, published at the end of March \(see p\. 14 of the report\) \. And, it mentions that the camp host 319 refugees, mostly of an Afgan origin, however, according to people who stay inside, currently there are 1000 people\.

Tunisia’s coastguard has discovered 24 more bodies of people who were aboard boats that sank off the coast near the city of Sfax in late April, a judicial official told [Reuters on May 4](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/tunisia-finds-24-more-bodies-migrants-after-boats-sank-april-2022-05-04/) \.

The confirmed death toll has now reached 67 from last month’s sinking of four boats as they tried to cross the Mediterranean to Italy\. More than 50 people are still missing\.

Frontex’s own data indicates that at least 13,000 people have been spotted using drones in 300 cases, according to Sea\-Watch International\.

The Italian coast guard rescued more than 100 people and recovered two bodies after their boat ran aground in Siderno, southern Italy, on May 6\.

Overall 111 people had been aboard, including 12 women and 10 minors when the boat hit an old disused pier on the coast of Siderno, [according to local media](https://www.lacnews24.it/cronaca/migranti-a-siderno-barca-si-incaglia-a-pochi-metri-dalla-riva-ci-sono-due-morti-e-si-temono-dispersi--live_154107/?fbclid=IwAR3eRpIkvo3QJzzaJVtrdR5N4Gl3ArOOdInXCDeGDAuhbNEUtzKeXZsrASY) \.

#### LITHUANIA
### **For 9 months 2,500 asylum seekers in Lithuania continue to face inhumane conditions of detention**

More than 2,500 people on the move continue to live under inhumane and degrading conditions for 9 months now, despite a [report](https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/1596976/report-slams-lithuania-s-treatment-of-asylum-seekers-as-inhuman-and-degrading?fbclid=IwAR3-BFgZ28kVwZsUElj7FfjIzWHgpwME982GwgEozcyGJd8okf4MlrjUWXA) published by the Seimas Ombudsmen’s Office \(SOO\) at the beginning of the year, which revealed how Lithuania treats refugees, asylum seekers, and other migrant groups — which is equivalent to detention\.

Being arbitrarily detained and with no access to a fair asylum process, survivors of torture and sexual abuse experience mental health distress as health and protection conditions are inadequate and no specialised support for a psychiatric disorder is provided, reports MSF\.

60% of people examined by psychologists from MSF in Lithuania between January and March 2022 have complained of anxiety\. The majority of these patients indicated that their fears were related to the conditions of detention in the detention camps, states journalist Franziska Grillmeier on Twitter\.

### **UK’s government cuts overseas foreign aid to leave 40,000 Syrian children out of school**

More than 40,000 Syrian children in northern Syria will be forced out of school amid cuts in the British government’s foreign aid to the UK\-based charity Syria Relief as of 30 April, [reports the Guardian\.](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/may/05/uk-aid-cuts-have-forced-40000-syrian-children-out-of-school-charity-says?fbclid=IwAR0s4DFpYnMBmd9T536sfvLjpE85i_t0xNJuwpbflfV1Swli_HteGNfmr-Y)

[Syria Relief](https://syriarelief.org.uk/appeals/save-syrias-schools/) based in Manchester is one of the largest Syria\-focused non\-governmental organizations, and currently operates 133 schools in Northern Syria\. However, with the decision of the British government to cut its total foreign aid spending from its commitment of 0\.7% of gross national income to 0\.5%, the number of schools might be reduced to just 24 and, potentially, zero by August 2022\. More on this [here](https://syriarelief.org.uk/media/220504143232/the%20children%20failed%20by%20the%20world%20v6.pdf) \.
