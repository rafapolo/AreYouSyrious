#### GENERAL
### Over 50,000 individuals have lost their lives on their migratory journeys as they sought a safer and better future for themselves

Whilst the data included in this IOM report is not completely accurate, nor can it be, these figures expose how much risk People on the Move are faced with when fleeing violence and persecution\.

IOM have reported that more than half of 50,000 deaths took place on the routes to and within Europe\. Around **25,104 lives** have been lost in the Mediterranean\.


> Over 30,000 people in the Missing Migrants Project records are of an unknown nationality, indicating that more than 60 per cent of those who die on migratory routes remain unidentified — leaving thousands of families searching for answers\. 





> …Of the missing migrants whose nationality could be identified, more than 9,000 were from African nations, over 6,500 were from Asia and another 3,000 were from the Americas\. 





Africa is the second deadliest region, as the IOM reports since 2014, there have been 9000 deaths among people on the move\.

In addition, along the US\-Mexico border there have been 4000 deaths since 2014, and almost 7000 deaths in the Americas in general, most enroute to the US\.

You can read the full report here: [2022 50k deaths\.pdf \(iom\.int\)](https://missingmigrants.iom.int/sites/g/files/tmzbdl601/files/publication/file/2022%2050k%20deaths.pdf)
#### LIBYA
### Still no formal investigation on crimes against refugees in Libya

A year ago today, LFJL, ECCHR Berlin, and the International Federation for Human Rights sent information to the ICC on crimes being committed against refugees and asylum seekers in Libya\. They call on Prosecutor Kamrin Khan to investigate properly, as well as on the EU and its member states to stop their involvement with the pullbacks by the Libyan Coastguard and to create more safe routes to the EU\.

#### CROATIA
### The work of AYS and the emergency response to people on the move who were left freezing and alone in Zagreb

AYS Free Shop remains the only place consistently and constantly providing people in need with things they need and support they might use\. Our volunteers are also actively supporting the people on the move who are not asylum seekers or asylees in Croatia, and we were among the initiators of an organised answer to the needs of those freezing around the main train station, and other secluded places in the city area\. This answer has so far come through the support of the City of Zagreb, but with very limited means and support, given that the official stance of Croatia is that the people who had been sent off with the infamous seven\-days' notice are supposed to be leaving the territory and “don’t fall under any support system”\. Given the shockingly poor reporting about this topic in Croatia, we intend to publish a long read in our AYS Specials series, in Croatian and in English, with more details about it\.

Donations are of course always welcome:

#### AUSTRIA
### Emergency conditions in Austria

Cold and wet weather has left 300 individuals sleeping in wet tents for roughly two weeks\. Border Crossing Spielfeld are calling for emergency heated shelters, as well as proper rooms provided by the Ministry of Interior and State governments\.


> Catering as before consists of only 3 x 0\.5 litres of cold water, four slices of toast with sides for breakfast and dinner, a kebab for lunch\. Hot drinks will not be served\. Who no get money stay hungry\. 





The group is mainly from Syria and they have spent months travelling through Turkey, Greece and the Balkan route in order to reach Austria\. They are now being made to remain in these tents before being sent to more permanent forms of accommodation\.

### Suella Braverman unintentionally highlights the fact the UK asylum system is clearly broken

In a questioning by Conservative MP, Tim Loughton, Suella Braverman is unable to clearly state what the legal routes are for entering the UK and how an individual can seek asylum in the UK without having to cross the Channel/enter irregularly\.

### Manston processing centre is now empty

The facility, which has a capacity for 1600 people and was supposed to be used as a temporary holding facility for asylum seekers, was reported to be holding 4000 individuals earlier this month\.

Everyone has now been moved to other centres and forms of accommodation\. Manston will continue to be used as a centre to conduct checks on individuals arriving across the Channel\.
