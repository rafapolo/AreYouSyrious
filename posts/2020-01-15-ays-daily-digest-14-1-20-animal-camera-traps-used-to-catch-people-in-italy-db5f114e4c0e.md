‘Nevermind democracy [here is the](http://aestheticsofcrisis.org/2014/no-euro-no-vision/) European Union’
#### FEATURED

The European criteria on for the methods used by the Member States to “combat illegal migration” is reaching a new low\. 
Announcing the new idea of using animal traps to “catch” people and send them back to Slovenia, the Italian regional councilor for security, Pierpaolo Roberti said:


> “The Friuli\-Venezia\-Giulia Region is ready to purchase photo traps to be placed on the paths near the borders to identify in real\-time the transits of irregular immigrants\. These optical detection systems would transmit the data collected to the regional administration and law enforcement, thus allowing targeted interventions and increasing the number of readmissions, particularly to Slovenia“\. 





The commissioner then specified that “these are inexpensive equipment which, thanks to specific software, can be calibrated to identify only human presence\. Their adoption is therefore an interesting opportunity that is added to the others already proposed, such as the use of drones or fixed positions with thermal cameras”\.

We have thus far found no official reactions to this by the EU institutions or the international refugee agencies\.
#### GREECE

The boat that sank near the island of Paxi, western Greece, killing at least 12 people, appears to have had 50 people on board, examinations show\. The suspects thought to be smugglers, aged 26, 30 and 49 and identified as Afghan nationals, were among those rescued by the Coast Guard on January 11, the media [report](http://www.ekathimerini.com/248398/article/ekathimerini/news/three-to-testify-over-migrant-boat-sinking-off-paxi?fbclid=IwAR2-0IlltXuLFssI7LjgQRxe8BKd9nB6vz2r1z3a0o0niTGvLCzNJSY8G4s) , and they will appear on Tuesday before an investigative magistrate in the western town of Preveza\.

The number of arrivals since last Wednesday reportedly arrived to 284 on Lesvos, 56 on Chios and 137 on Samos\. In the meantime, on Tuesday 500 people were transferred from Lesvos and Samos to the mainland\. 
There are still 21,123 people on the island of Lesvos, of which 19,122 are staying in Moria\.

By the end of February, more than 10,000 asylum seekers currently staying at the so\-called reception and identification centers will [reportedly](https://www.kathimerini.gr/1059737/article/epikairothta/ellada/anoigoyn-deka-nees-domes-filo3enias) have been transferred from the Aegean islands\. According to a government plan, these people will bee housed in new structures planned for their accommodation\. Despite the reactions following announcements from local MPs and local authorities on the location of the new centers, the official plan is allegedly to begin immediately with setting up the structures\.

There are already 30 open accommodation structures in the country, with about 25,000 people\. According to government planning, the 10 new centers will be able to accommodate 10,000 to 15,000 people and will be established in Ilia, Arta, Amfilochia, Larissa, two more in Central Macedonia, one in Central Greece, one in Fthiotida \(the most likely in Lamia\) and two in Crete, one of which in the Prefecture of Rethymnon\.

NO NAME KITCHEN health program is a call to all those people who wants to take action against injustice\. The program covers health needs: basic services are often insufficient and people on the move barely access medical care within transit countries, including Bosnia\-Herzegovina, Greece, Montenegro and Serbia\.


> Local population is sometimes set in a vulnerable context that leaves them without any access to health care, an access that the program aims to assure\. This initiative is a simple, direct and human way not only to support people in need but also a possibility for the supporters to get in touch with people on the move and touch with hands daily challenges all these people experience during their migration path\. 





> The program started in June, 2019 allowing 150 people to access medical care, most cases are about dentist, optician and general medicines\. The reasons why people in transit access this program are: discrimination, lack of documentation to access free services, lack of the specialized services within the public system and emergency situations which are not always recognized by the public hospitals which require the patients to pay for those services\. 





> The connection is real and tangible: people on the move and supporters get in touch with each other to share a word, a virtual hug and strength to continue the trip\. “I heard about the Balkan route, but I could not imagine that people traveled months or years, neither that they lived in abandoned houses or that the reception system was that poor in transit country” claimed Gaia, an Italian girl who supported Saim, 22 years old from Pakistan who got a dermatological problem\. The soul of the program is therefore not only fight injustice, allowing people on the move to access basic health services, but also to raise awareness on the Balkan route as well as the challenging situation faced by people on the move\. 





> The program also supports local people when vulnerable to launch a key message: solidarity knows no boundaries\.

### Velika Kladuša

In Velika Kladuša, one of the two main towns closest to the border with Croatia/EU, the volunteers keep up their work with the many people who haven’t been ‘fortunate’ enough to get a place at the official \(horrible as it is\) camp Miral in the city, ran by the IOM\. These people improvise in order to find a place to rest each day, mostly in abandoned shacks and houses, or outside in some provisional camp\-like points\. The people helping in the area range from the locals, those present in the city for more than a year, and groups of changing volunteer teams, primarily the No Name Kitchen team\. One of the people who has now been living in Kladuša for a long time is Pixi, who has reactivated his list of needs in order to continue working\. He writes:


> We need building material so we can build shelters for humans\.
 

> Sleeping bags
 

> Matresses
 

> Blankets 





> For now, we are good with medical supplies for about two months except for the scabies treatment medicine\. 





> Needs:
 

> Scabies treatment
 

> Gloves
 

> Warm underwear \(short and long\)
 

> Jackets l and m
 

> Pants
 

> Warm socks
 

> Shoes 40–44

#### CROATIA

_As an answer to the presentation of the Croatian plan for the Council of EU Presidency, the country’s prime minister received rightful reactions from some of the MEPs in Brussels\._

After Andrej Plenković presented Croatia’s priorities during its presidency of the EU, European Greens leader Ska Keller spoke about reports of alleged violence and abuse by Croatia’s police against illegal migrants on the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina\.

“The EU has to respect law and human rights at its own borders\. Unfortunately, we keep getting news that there are numerous serious human rights violations — especially at the Croatian border”, the president of the GUE\-NGL group said\.

“Here, for example, **their government has an obligation to campaign for a reform of the European migration policy** — one that is committed to human rights and the fundamental right to asylum,” he concluded\.

Swedish MEP Malin Björk had equally strong words for the Croatian Prime Minister over the country’s violent pushbacks at its borders with Slovenia, Serbia and Bosnia, having visited the various sites herself just before Christmas:


> “The Croatian presidency wants to focus on rule of law and humane migration management\. But that completely contradicts what is currently happening at the Croatian borders and inside the country\.” 




“According to careful estimates, there had been 10,000 illegal pushbacks in 2018 and more than 25,000 in 2019–10,000 of them were chain pushbacks stretching from Slovenia to Croatia and Bosnia\.”

**“Not only this, I am sure the Croatian Prime Minister has read reports of systematic brutality and cruelty by Croatian border police in carrying out the pushbacks\. They are absolutely shocking\.”**

“At the borders, I heard stories from people who had been pushed back\. I saw their wounds — which were even worse than in the reports\. Some had been maimed by dogs, others by taser\. I heard first hand stories of many who had been beaten and had their had all their belongings stolen by the border police, or had to stand in ice cold water up to their chest for 3o minutes before being forced to march back to Bosnia\. It was endless\.”

“Anyone trying to assist refugees and migrants are persecuted\. It is frankly speaking a horrendous situation all together,” said the Swedish MEP\.

Croatian MEP Tomislav Sokol \(HDZ\) responded that those were **untruths as the reports referred to were not by the relevant bodies** \. He underlined that Croatia is respecting the law, but **Bjork** said that in the very short time **she visited the border she saw 25 pushbacks\.**
#### ITALY
### Cavarzerani curfew and checks in the apartments on demand of La Lega

On the request of the League, the infamous Italian right\-wing party, whose members met the Prefect of Udine, in order “to improve security in the city”, the decision was made that “more stringent rules” for the evening return to Cavarzerani reception centre, and that they would do cross checks on those people living in rented apartments across town\.

Cavarzerani is a ‘first reception centre’ in Udine, Friuli\-Venezia Giulia\. In August 2018 an Afghan Dublin returnee suffering from mental illness [committed suicide](https://www.asylumineurope.org/reports/country/italy/reception-conditions/housing/conditions-reception-facilities#footnote12_4ipo0rd) in the centre\. According to media reports, the barracks were hosting about 700 people during those summer months, whereas the maximum capacity is 350 people\.
First reception centres are collective centres, up until now set up in large facilities, isolated from urban centres and with poor or otherwise difficult contacts with the outside world\. Generally speaking, all governmental centres are very often overcrowded\. Accordingly, the quality of the reception services offered is not equivalent to reception facilities of smaller size\.
#### DENMARK

The Danish branch of Amnesty International has now initiated a petition to the Danish government demanding that the conditions in the exit center Ellebæk must be rectified in accordance with the recent report from the European Council’s Torture Commission\.

#### SWEDEN

The critical and independent media platform Kvartal is accusing the minister of justice and immigration, Morgan Johansson, manipulation and omissions in regard to statistics about the reunification of families and others to Sweden\.

The claim is that the minister on his Twitter account recently has been doing a deliberate misrepresentation of changes in the legal framework for reunification and their subsequent effects on the inflow of asylum seekers to Sweden\.

The main issue is the categorization of asylum seekers between the ones who are in risk of personal persecution and others who are fleeing war and in this way are facing a more general risk\. As the statistics aimed at targeting the effect of a more liberal set of rules is not able to identify a distinction between the two groups, and as the length of the administrative process is not sufficiently accounted for, the minister’s statements of a causal link become invalid and manipulative, according to the platform\.

Also, the refusal of answering any clarifying questions to the matter is stressing the impression of the minister as best ignoring his responsibilities\.
#### NORWAY
### What happens to the children brought back from the ISIS\-held area?

A case: a 29\-year\-old IS\-accused woman and her two children are now being brought home from Syria to Norway\. The woman and children came out of Syria this afternoon, it was [reported](https://www.aftenposten.no/verden/i/70Mbp3/norge-gjoer-helomvending-henter-hjem-is-siktet-norsk-kvinne-og-hennes-syke-5-aaring?fbclid=IwAR2eIArr6xO668b6lxpbwpQ00CPSsBJjTcqlTNqnYhBcp5-ZXSqxpZugFGc) \.

The return of the two children and the mother involves an apparent political reversal on the part of the Norwegian government\. The woman came out of the IS area in Baghouz last year, and she has consistently claimed that she wants to return to Norway with her children\. The Norwegian authorities have stated that all Norwegian citizens, including the IS women and their children, have the right to return to Norway\. At the same time, they have made it clear that they will not do anything active to help the women back home\.

The government’s policies have been heavily criticized, not the least because no more efforts has been done to help the 29\-year\-old’s son\. He has a condition that a Syrian doctor has diagnosed as “probably cystic fibrosis”\.
#### UK
### A disturbing restraining case at the Yarl’s Wood


> “Given her nationality and where she comes from I had concerns about HIV\.” 




This was a comment by one of the guards at the infamous Yarl’s Wood prison after a woman bit her as a reaction while she was forcibly being restrained by 5 guards\. The Nigerian woman who was restrained face down by a group of guards in the detention centre feared for her life and begged them to stop holding her neck, a court has heard\. 
The detention custody officers for Serco, a Home Office sub\-contractor, were trying to deliver her to escorts who would put her on a charter flight to Nigeria, which was due to take off from Birmingham airport that evening, the media [reported](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/13/woman-feared-for-life-after-guards-restrained-her-in-immigration-centre?fbclid=IwAR1djw-rI9lvAQ_2bI9LUiyLmPmDyOIXlHNVr-DPgaQiirXDu1CnKXShueY) \. The court heard the woman was resisting because her solicitor had informed her the removal had been canceled\. It was later confirmed that the Home Office had indeed deferred her removal on that evening’s charter flight\.

This occurred in May 2018, but already in the months leading up to this particular arrest, AYS [wrote](ays-daily-digest-27-2-18-people-pushed-back-even-in-severe-conditions-35dd08e65011) about the centre and that contrary to what the officials keep saying, the women at the centre claim there is no pattern in the circumstances of detainees, only the reasons given by the Home Office\. They organised a hunger strike at the time\. T [he hunger strike was happening](https://news.sky.com/story/120-women-on-hunger-strike-in-immigration-centre-11265270) because as fearful as the 120 women had been, they were tired of being silenced with a plate of food\.
