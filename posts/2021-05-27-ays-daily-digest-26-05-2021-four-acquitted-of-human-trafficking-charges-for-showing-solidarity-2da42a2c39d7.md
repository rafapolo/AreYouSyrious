#### Four People Charged for Showing Solidarity Acquitted in Belgium

After a lengthy legal battle, a group of four people that were charged with human trafficking for sheltering people on the move in their homes were [finally acquitted](https://bx1.be/categories/news/cour-dappel-de-bruxelles-les-hebergeurs-de-migrants-sont-acquittes/?fbclid=IwAR3_5Cb6qrlJZcur5cIsjQXu58hoojzjSxNDY2rL1TVtNQixjZ8AfI6jrP0) by the Bruxelles court of appeals\. The group included the journalists Anouk Van Gestel and Myriam Berghe as well as a social worker from the capital\.

The four were initially [acquitted in 2018](https://www.bruzz.be/justitie/viertal-dat-vluchtelingen-onderdak-bood-vrijgesproken-2021-05-26?fbclid=IwAR3e0xPeBk77ZtAdqyVDZ7mwJ5iHLtzMkDRaLahJoH24q3eL7ns8UbOsGQ8) , but the public prosecutor’s office appealed\. The higher court held up the initial ruling, meaning that this long legal battle will finally be over\. The lawyers for the people celebrated this ruling, saying that it was a relief after the long years and thousands of euros spent on a legal battle\. It’s also a victory of principle as it shows that sheltering people in one’s home, providing them with Internet access, or helping them with translation cannot be considered human trafficking\.

Also on trial alongside the four Belgian citizens were seven people on the move who were convicted of human trafficking\. The people had only helped smugglers for a set period of time by closing truck doors and performing other menial tasks, a common arrangement for people who cannot afford the hefty trafficking fees\. While it is unfortunate that they were convicted at all, the court of appeals lessened their sentences to symbolic lengths of one year to forty months with postponement and reprieve of the fees\. While the court did well in recognizing that the people were victims themselves, not profiteers, although it is a shame that people are punished for doing something when they had no other options\.
#### ALGERIA
#### Algeria Expels People on the Move, Leaves Them in the Desert

In a stunningly inhumane story from North Africa, the Algerian government continued to expel people on the move despite borders that were ostensibly closed, often leaving them in [the middle of the Sahara](https://www.africa-express.info/2021/05/26/lalgeria-continua-a-espellere-i-migranti-e-abbandona-in-mezzo-al-deserto/?fbclid=IwAR2qeCGwo08rKGDKU6MOxCpN6d9OJetRw1A2zOjEk7PFmILuaSMxeKh5TOc) on the Nigerien border\. Often the people had to pass several kilometers on foot to reach some form of shelter, after they had been detained in inhumane conditions for weeks or even months\.
#### GREECE
#### Police Brutality in Moria 2\.0’s Quarantine Section

A disturbing story emerged out of the quarantine section of the heavily militarized Moria 2\.0 camp\. A young woman from West Africa was kicked by police officers after asking the officers a question\. In a video taken by the woman and [published by Mare Liberum](https://mare-liberum.org/en/police-brutality-in-the-quarantine-section-of-moria-2-0/?fbclid=IwAR0eTyo1NVoj2_WgY0xo5oUyTSgWmMSVf9PjVAfC0q3ZxChikihcaOcHVX4) , you can clearly see boot marks on the woman’s thighs and buttocks\. She also filmed footage of the quarantine section, showing the cramped living conditions and poor facilities\.

This is just one aspect of the violence that is enacted against people on the move by authorities in the camp\. They are able to act with impunity because the government heavily restricted the access of journalists and NGOs, limiting information about what is going on\.

Things are particularly dire in the quarantine section, where about 140 people are living in very cramped quarters with almost no medical care\. This includes people that have tested positive as well as people that were potentially exposed but tested negative, making it highly likely that those who tested negative will actually get sick\. According to [evidence on the ground](https://www.facebook.com/NBKLesvos/posts/2058243764315402) , infections in the camp are rising, but authorities conveniently stopped publishing numbers just as the tourist season began\. Cases are rising [in many camps](https://twitter.com/EleniKonstanto/status/1397491527904108547?fbclid=IwAR0nXCyeUsDA27n-OFUOn-qZ11gbYBH9sP6jPDjcyeF6g_tpDtWiOm7rEEk) across Greece, where a year after the pandemic began people still do not even have a place to wash\. Despite calls from people such as [MEP Tineke Strik](https://tinekestrik.eu/news/letter-tineke-strik-after-her-visit-greece-urging-european-commission-change-conditions?fbclid=IwAR2YVr-YPTd95QwotvFsbS8FgxIkGghHxVLtv3BaDHqO0Skbjva_KfzPy70) to change the situation in the camps, little has been done\.

While the government used the pandemic as an excuse to make the lives of people on the move even more miserable, and as restrictions lift for Greek and European citizens, there is little sign of hope or lifting restrictions in the camps\.

Instead, the government is building [walls around the camp](https://twitter.com/maledictus/status/1397468385131343875?fbclid=IwAR0_GjvR2a-cK5BAo_FWLqC34aQcnnekgM1yzEd22EskxeGxvtf7pMRlUsc) s that are as high as the Berlin Wall\. This shows that the legal obligation to use detention [only as a last resort](https://rli.blogs.sas.ac.uk/2021/05/14/implementation-of-gcm-objective-13-in-the-unece-region-little-added-value-provided-by-the-compact-in-making-immigration-detention-a-last-resort/?fbclid=IwAR10xBrX4YVjUEl5VKuY0xNMJo0pjDFhCyv6oY0OZtsZP5XZ-HDWYJdRcU4) is rarely upheld\.

[This article](https://www.dw.com/de/migration-schwere-vorw%C3%BCrfe-gegen-griechische-beh%C3%B6rden/a-57672350?fbclid=IwAR11NZRrG5eXnVKggRhCdm2xpLqMWWvQkPLe_iUXo6QOq4j6lCLknc5iuB8) from DW \(in German\) outlines the way the Greek government has used the pandemic to crack down on people’s legal rights across Greece, where thousands of people fear arbitrary deportations and detention\.

One sad example of this comes from Thessaloniki\. A young Moroccan man was [detained and violently expelled](https://racistcrimeswatch.wordpress.com/2021/05/24/1-1191/?fbclid=IwAR0Ebwr3ZgO_rYI5Etowt1f3YmABP_zxoVE0ocY04qvd5lNYxY-X2WmfzdI) from Greece, even though he had arrived legally and had paperwork from the Greek police giving him the right to remain\. He was detained for hours on end, his belongings confiscated, without receiving water or food\. While he was being transported, the police insulted him with derogatory racist language, calling him “Ali Baba,” and at one point three officers attacked him together, causing grave injuries\.

The man, Z\.B\., is now represented by two human rights lawyers and the [Helsinki Committee\.](https://twitter.com/VassilisTsarnas/status/1397650134553538563?fbclid=IwAR2N98yzUOOMF6mpYwQEvYcPnH-Nz_psw__NmaA7xMT_hRlr9vTMhIolt08)
#### Repression of NGOs

In addition to cracking down on people on the move, the Greek government has used the past year as an opportunity to crack down on NGOs, particularly nonprofits that work with POM\. Legal changes that were made without public consultation, including two difficult registry requirements, provide an impossible climate for NGOs to operate\. These measures have been criticized domestically and internationally\. So far, the government has [rejected twice as many nonprofits](https://rsaegean.org/en/registry-of-ngos-working-with-refugees-and-migrants-in-greece-under-scrutiny?fbclid=IwAR0_GjvR2a-cK5BAo_FWLqC34aQcnnekgM1yzEd22EskxeGxvtf7pMRlUsc) as it has registered, despite telling the Council of Europe that the registration process is not designed to be cumbersome\.
#### Other Updates from Lesvos:

[Dimitrios Kalogiannis](https://www.stonisi.gr/post/17361/agnoeitai-o-dhmhtrhs-apo-th-sykamnia?fbclid=IwAR3LyBz_zj-PxorQ13Ati9tw8mbs6_yq6ocWc45qCt0TR8a-5_T3P8A3zkc) is missing\. He is well\-known for his solidarity work with people on the move\. Dimitrios is transgender and was the victim of a series of attacks by a [gang of hateful minors](https://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2020/12/28/lesvos-gang-minors-terrorize-vulnerable-person/) a few months ago that caused him to suffer a mental health crisis\. We hope that he is safe\.
#### Updates from Samos

[This article](https://blogs.mediapart.fr/julien-lechvien/blog/210521/peintre-physicienne-nucleaire-activiste-ceux-que-le-terme-refugie-cache?fbclid=IwAR2YVr-YPTd95QwotvFsbS8FgxIkGghHxVLtv3BaDHqO0Skbjva_KfzPy70) in the French newspaper Mediapart follows the stories of three people detained in Samos whose dreams have been put on hold by the absurd length of detention\.
#### Updates from Athens

A young woman sleeping rough in Athens is in desperate need of assistance\. She is suffering from epilepsy and several psychiatric illnesses, but no longer has the money to treat her condition\. She has been unable to access housing or any kind of support after leaving the island of Kos, where she and her husband were threatened by militant groups because of their beliefs\. You can read her full story [here](https://www.facebook.com/NoNameKitchenBelgrade/posts/1245228512542097) \.
#### BOSNIA & HERZEGOVINA
#### Testimony of Attacks in Kladuša

#### SPAIN
#### Aftermath of Arrivals to Ceuta

Thousands of people arrived in the Spanish exclave of Ceuta last week and were met with police repression and mass deportations that violated their individual rights to seek asylum\. Now, dozens of people [are in hiding](https://elpais.com/espana/2021-05-26/los-fantasmas-de-las-calles-de-ceuta.html?fbclid=IwAR1IVtNFSoTCDsQjKGIoGNTs4hspQzrz8FgnxO-cfjnoTXOZkfYrEivWInQ) across the exclave because they fear deportation before even having the chance to plead their case\.

[200 minors](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/32516/spain-transfers-200-moroccan-children-from-ceuta?fbclid=IwAR3PQpDCNNil1A6l7__k9g2Y5GP6hqDm_56yTGqPlSLt20XAo-34da4HAIs) will finally be transferred to the mainland from Ceuta\. The 800 unaccompanied minors who arrived last week are not included in that number\. Ceuta’s center for minors was already full before the arrivals, so this forced the government to finally act on transfers\. Many children are still in hiding because they do not trust the police\.
#### FRANCE
#### More Expulsions in Camps on the Border

Wednesday morning, 15 trucks of CRS forces, the National Police’s general reserve, arrived to perform expulsions\. [Video footage](https://www.facebook.com/SolidarityBorder/posts/497591314914646) shows the heavily equipped officers menacing people on the move\. In a bizarre game, the people were expelled from a site they had been ordered to last month by the municipal government—by that same government\.
#### DENMARK
#### Government Proceeds With More Repressive Measures Despite Widespread Outrage

On Wednesday, countless [people across Denmark](https://www.facebook.com/events/493024585457090/) protested against the government’s measures to deport some Syrian people to Damascus\. For the eighth day, people held a [sit\-in and hunger strike](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=107000361586462&id=104695588483606) in front of the Danish Parliament, although so far it has not been enough to move the hard hearts within the building’s walls\.

Instead, the government is looking for new ways to make life harder for people on the move\. It is considering a bill to transfer asylum seekers to a [third country](https://www.unhcr.org/neu/dk/56641-unhcr-opfordrer-folketinget-til-ikke-at-vedtage-regeringens-lovforslag-om-overforsel-af-asylansogere-til-et-tredjeland.html?fbclid=IwAR1IVtNFSoTCDsQjKGIoGNTs4hspQzrz8FgnxO-cfjnoTXOZkfYrEivWInQ) while their application is being processed\. This bill has been heavily criticized [by the UNHCR](https://www.unhcr.org/neu/55821-unhcr-warns-against-exporting-asylum-calls-for-responsibility-sharing-for-refugees-not-burden-shifting.html?fbclid=IwAR3LyBz_zj-PxorQ13Ati9tw8mbs6_yq6ocWc45qCt0TR8a-5_T3P8A3zkc) , which pointed out that this would hurt the safety of people on the move and could trigger a “race to the bottom” among other European states looking to do the same thing\.

According to sources on the ground, the government is also planning a mass deportation from the Ellebaek detention center either Sunday or Monday\. This will happen despite the fact that Kabul has been deemed so unsafe [Australia is closing its embassy](https://apnews.com/article/kabul-australia-ebfe7a3f7ce96a54b5bfb2fb91552f3e?fbclid=IwAR3SyAjKbTPVXb7GIoodgcjiCWBrJesiF058D0XJgDS0-8EjStDk8AGGsKU) and numerous other countries are withdrawing their staff\.
#### ICELAND
#### Evicted People on the Move Denied Medical Care

The tiny Scandinavian island country is in the news more often for its tourist attractions than its human rights violations\. However, the government recently evicted 14 Palestinian asylum seekers because they would not take a pre\-deportation COVID screening to protest their deportations, which were issued under suspect legal circumstances\. Now, the government also took away their food stipend and [denied their access to medical care](https://grapevine.is/news/2021/05/26/evicted-refugees-now-also-reportedly-being-denied-medical-care/?fbclid=IwAR3vSUNefg77CXug3_pxp6ZQxZKANBDeA6PVsUKIhd01uk5iRUP73udGOe8) \.
#### UK
#### Lack of Financial Support Means Thousands Are Going Hungry

For several days, thousands of asylum seekers in the UK had [no way of getting food](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/asylum-seekers-home-office-aspen-cards-b1854401.html?fbclid=IwAR2YVr-YPTd95QwotvFsbS8FgxIkGghHxVLtv3BaDHqO0Skbjva_KfzPy70) because their Aspen cards, debit cards with prepaid amounts of money on them, stopped working\. The delay was caused by a changeover in contractors\. Although people were told that their cards would not be usable during the weekend due to the transfer, as late as Wednesday people still had no access to funds\. Many have young children that they need to feed and equip with diapers\. Although charities are trying to fill the gap, they can only do so much with the sheer amount of demand and bureaucratic obstacles placed by the Home Office\.
#### EU/FRONTEX
#### EU Condemns Lukashenko For Plane Hijacking—But Gave Him Millions for Migration Management

The EU announced sanctions against Belarus for the hijacking of a plane to kidnap a dissident journalist a few days ago\. In retaliation, Lukashenko announced that he would consider weakening border controls towards the West\. The EU has given the Belarusian dictator seven million euros for “ [strengthening migration management](https://twitter.com/TihomirSabchev/status/1397564221525737473?fbclid=IwAR0o5Y2PXaznk04_TUleX3kI6kqUtjeNr_Uu3XxGxhbIOWLSKgDZMtnXzHs) ”, despite long\-held concerns about his human rights record\.

The hearing on the New Pact on Asylum and Migration will [start on Thursday](https://twitter.com/EP_Justice/status/1397606112304717835?fbclid=IwAR0Ao505CCreb4H-deTlP5kjRuawJ8PsAhbfuXS8r01bw98p3gMH0K7uk4k) at 9 AM\. The procedure is detailed [here](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20210523IPR04610/new-pact-on-migration-and-asylum-debate-with-member-states-eu-bodies-and-ngos) \.

In [yesterday’s digest](ays-daily-digest-25-05-21-lawsuit-against-frontex-c04494da579e) , we reported on the legal action the NGO Front\-Lex is taking against Frontex for its complicity in illegal pushbacks\. Here is more on the case from [Statewatch](https://www.statewatch.org/news/2021/may/eu-legal-action-against-frontex-s-operations-in-greece-initiated-at-the-european-court-of-justice/?fbclid=IwAR1QTCdDYFF-G7vLGaMmTxYqvw3xfuhnzQVgkRDpHVo8xE-Pv7SHq8uytkQ) \.
#### GENERAL
#### Organizations Condemn EU’s Role in Death at Sea

The deadly events of May have shown that the European policy of “ [lethal disregard](https://reliefweb.int/report/libya/lethal-disregard-search-and-rescue-and-protection-migrants-central-mediterranean-sea?fbclid=IwAR06nOb-CuOPhmfmPxGYQSqv6N-hE5nqdQ95mLaZypzgCRvPtgJqeU3KntI) ” towards people in distress at sea will be a blot on the continent’s conscience for a time to come\. Despite a new report from the UN detailing the deadly events at sea last year and criticism from the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, there have been no moves yet to change European policy towards Search and Rescue\. While the [bodies of drowned children](https://thecivilfleet.wordpress.com/2021/05/26/un-demands-eu-reforms-it-search-and-rescue-policies-days-after-refugee-bodies-wash-up-on-a-beach-in-libya/?fbclid=IwAR1Xo94GIVBcCVfZW45pU_L-9JX5wLr76fO1EJpJl4RQ6dRYGnkP6BR0J8c) washing up on Libyan beaches move the hearts of people worldwide, they do not seem to be enough to move governments into action\. The Council of Europe [released a report](https://www.coe.int/en/web/commissioner/-/european-countries-must-urgently-change-their-migration-policies-which-endanger-refugees-and-migrants-crossing-the-mediterranean?fbclid=IwAR0nXCyeUsDA27n-OFUOn-qZ11gbYBH9sP6jPDjcyeF6g_tpDtWiOm7rEEk) highlighting this issue all the way back in March, with no tangible action yet\.

[This report](https://sosmediterranee.com/eyes-on-the-central-med-20-recurring-reports-of-shipwrecks-rescues-interceptions-and-arrivals-put-search-and-rescue-in-the-central-mediterranean-back-on-eus-agenda/?fbclid=IwAR3qOU2dT-tsn6IiaZvNdmECmnsQup9Ne_6IXT9UMpAAWHnZtJtMT2r5q1s) from the Civil Fleet highlights the situation in the Central Mediterranean, where rescues are completely dependent on NGO ships, even though many are the victims of administrative blockades\. While hopefully there will soon be another ship in the Mediterranean, as the Irish organization Refugee Rescue [launched a fundraiser](https://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2021/05/26/news/irish-search-and-rescue-organisation-launch-2m-fundraising-campaign-to-buy-a-ship-to-help-save-refugees-lives-2334388/?fbclid=IwAR3qOU2dT-tsn6IiaZvNdmECmnsQup9Ne_6IXT9UMpAAWHnZtJtMT2r5q1s) to buy another ship, relying on NGOs is not a sustainable solution\.

The capacity for doing something is there—there are frequent flights by drones and aircraft from Frontex, local government authorities, and Operation Irini\. But as [Sergio Scandura](https://twitter.com/scandura/status/1397482678820249601) puts it, “Europe—with Italy at the head—has emptied that sea for years, removing its own rescue ships: it can observe from above and that’s it\.”
#### WORTH READING

Much has been written about climate change and its potential impact on displacement\. The impending global crisis will also have an impact [particularly on the Aegean](https://www.europemustact.org/post/climate-change-and-the-aegean-humanitarian-crisis?fbclid=IwAR1IVtNFSoTCDsQjKGIoGNTs4hspQzrz8FgnxO-cfjnoTXOZkfYrEivWInQ) \.
