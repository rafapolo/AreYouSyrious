#### FEATURED

Italy: On 29 November 2021, at the psychiatric ward of Rome’s St\. Camillo hospital, 26\-year\-old Wissem Abdel Latif died — tied to a bed\. He had been held in the ward for three days\. It is unclear what circumstances brought Wissem there\. His family and friends back in Tunisia describe him as a healthy young man without mental disorders and have been protesting in front of the Italian embassy in Tunis, asking for clear details on his death\. For over a week, entrance to the CPR \[an Italian detention center\] where Wissem was detained were blocked\. Only on Monday was Senator Gregorio De Falco finally allowed in\. His goal was to speak to the people who witnessed the days before Wissem’s death\. Strangely, one day earlier, all the Tunisians who had arrived with Wissem Abdel Latif had been moved “long before De Falco arrived and before they could give statements to activists, except by telephone\.”

So far, it is known that Wissem, like so many others, was not given his legal right, the possibility to claim asylum, though he was held on Lampedusa, then on a scrambled quarantine ship and finally, since October, in a CPR\. All without legal procedure\. It is also not known why he should have been declared mentally fit for detention, if indeed he was, and therefore sent from CPR to psychiatry\. Protests to learn about what exactly happened continue — there have been no answers so far\.


> “A squalid, shameful script, always the same\. \[…\] There is nothing natural about this story\. It shows the horror of the reception and repatriation system against which we will continue to fight relentlessly\. Wissem Abdel Latif died tied to his bed, where he remained until after his death \[…\] \. Every second that Wissem has been in this country he has suffered injustice, violence and abuse, culminating in an atrocious death,” — [LasciateCIEntrare](https://www.meltingpot.org/Morte-Wissem-Abdel-Latif-il-sistema-di-accoglienza-e-cura#.YbEHT1lw2Um) 





Just now, near the **border with Belarus** , close to Olchowka, [Polish soldiers reported finding the body of a man, a backpack and a Nigerian passport in a forest](https://www.dw.com/en/poland-says-another-migrant-found-dead-near-belarus-border/a-60056480) \. This is one of at least a dozen reported people who have been blocked to death in the last months\. We know nothing more about him and the circumstances of his death\.

And just now, five boys have gone missing at **Spain’s coast** \.

■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 


The boys’ disappearance was reported the morning after their messages were received\. All the responsible groups in place \(Spanish and Moroccan Coast Guard / Police, Red Cross\) have been unable to locate the boys since then\.

How to not be speechless at the abstracting structures which are meant to make us forget and prefer to act unseen, but that are visible enough for all of us? Does finding words mean that we have started to accept what we see and hear? Is it audacity to talk about lives as if they were just words? It’s not necessary to have any answers to that, or to explain any of it with reason\.

Initiatives take it one step at a time\. Spain’s Red Cross, as other organisations, have started to put emphasis on the losses where they can, by trying to identify the bodies of those dead who reach the coast eventually\.


> The family has the right to know what happened and we also have an obligation to fulfill their rights whenever we can\. 





[The Atlantic crossing to Spain’s Canary Islands is one of the most common, as well as most dangerous, routes used by migrants trying to reach Europe\. So far this year, 937 people have died or gone missing on such voyages\. For worried relatives—trying to find information about loved ones lost at sea can be almost impossible\.](https://www.france24.com/en/video/20211208-families-have-a-right-to-know-the-effort-to-identify-migrants-lost-at-sea)
#### LIBYA

**Italian military ship arrives in Tripoli to be used by “Coast Guard”**

After recent friendly diplomatic talks between Greek and Libyan politicians, a mission considered secret has taken place: [It is probably Italy’s “San Giorgio” that was photographed in Tripoli’s harbour and it has therefore been moved there over the last days\.](https://www.repubblica.it/esteri/2021/12/07/news/nave_italiana_libia-329232874/) The military ship is supposed to prevent further flight of detained refugees in Libya and was sent to Libya with mobile MRCC \(Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre\) — equipment to facilitate activities at sea for the so\-called Libyan Coast Guard\. The “Coast Guard”, infamous for not reacting to emergency calls, for unsafe pullbacks to Libya, for hindering people from fleeing cruel conditions in the country and even for profiting from the smuggler networks they pretend to fight, is therefore directly supported by the EU: The mobile station is part of an agreement with the EU and financed by it — with costs amounting to around 15 million euros\. There have been several questions to the EU Parliament focusing on the new “rescue centre”, its costs and especially its management: Who will guarantee that it won’t be an instrument that increases abuse? But guaranteed or not, the EU can be sure to have taken the next step to outsourcing its border policy: Crimes are committed through money\.

#### SEA

**SOS Mediterranee’s report on the last three weeks** [has been published](https://en.sosmediterranee.org/news/a-fatal-shipwreck-and-high-numbers-of-departures-mark-the-onset-of-winter-in-the-central-mediterranean/) \. A fatal shipwreck and high numbers of departures in November mark the onset of winter in the central Mediterranean\.
#### GREECE

**Migrant starts legal case against the country**

Ibrahim Obbo, a Cameroonian migrant, left to die in the Aegean Sea by Greek elements, is seeking justice at the ECHR \(European Court of Human Rights\) \. He is demanding €100,000 compensation for human rights violations and emotional distress\. These include the reaction of Greek troops when Obbo and the group he was arrived on the inflatable boat they had come with from Turkey\. [Once they landed on the island, Greek forces initially fired warning shots and then detained them\. He and his fellows were reportedly put in a boat and then thrown into the sea without life jackets, after being beaten\.](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20211207-cameroonian-migrant-takes-greece-to-european-court-over-leaving-him-to-die-at-sea/) Obbo reached the Turkish Aydin province by swimming, while the others died\. In Turkey, he has received legal help and a lawyer support by an NGO, and will be taking his experience of the usual Greek pushback practice to court\.

**Ministry of Migration and Asylum rejects registration of NGO**

Nineteen NGOs releasing a joint statement express their concern about the denial\. The Ministry of Migration and Asylum has blocked the registration of “Refugee Support Aegean” \(RSA\) on its NGO registry, despite the endorsement of the competent services\.


> We are particularly concerned by the substantive grounds for such rejection, citing that the “development of activity” “in support of persons under deportation” is contrary to Greek legislation\. — [RSA](https://rsaegean.org/en/joint-statement-by-19-org-ngo-registry-rejection/) 





**Independent surveillance mechanism for pushbacks**

EU commissioner Ylva Johansson [welcomes Greece’s intention](https://twitter.com/VassilisTsarnas/status/1468673451791732744) to be the [“first country to establish an independent surveillance mechanism”](https://www.efsyn.gr/kosmos/eyropi/322781_milisa-me-gerapetriti-tha-ginei-o-anexartitos-mihanismos-epitirisis-synoron) for pushbacks conducted against asylum seekers\. Despite having agreed to such a thing in the beginning, Greek Prime minister Mitsotakis and Immigration and Asylum Minister Mitarakis have blocked it for months: Both have claimed that there is no need for an additional independent mechanism and that in fact the Greeks’ own mechanisms are more than enough to make sure laws are respected\. Now the testimony on the accidental pushback of a Frontex translator, put into a boat with other people as he apparently didn’t look Greek enough, has worked as a catalyst for further efforts\. Commissioner Johansson states that she had a positive encounter with Greek Minister of State Gerapetritis, “who explained to her how it will work”\. He also expressed his concerns about the single incident with the Frontex translator, and that he will look into the case again\.

**Pope’s words in Lesbos, Greece’s vaunt**

While Pope Francis [asked to “stop ignoring reality”](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/12/05/europe/pope-francis-greece-lesbos-visit-refugees-intl/index.html) and was planning to finish his trip to Greece by taking at least a group of refugees to Italy in his plane, Greek Foreign minister Dendias reacted in his own way\. According to him, the visit “highlighted the important and positive way in which our country handles the migration–refugee issue”\. It is not clear what he means by the positive way: The illegal pushbacks, or asylum procedures that don’t take place and leave people on the street for over six years\.
#### NETHERLANDS

**Poor conditions in emergency centers**

The Dutch Group Vluchtelingenwerk [reports on 21 of the Netherland’s 35 reception centers](https://www.vluchtelingenwerk.nl/nieuws/onderzoek-leefomstandigheden-noodopvang-schieten-ernstig-tekort) mostly used over the past couple of years\. According to it, in many of the emergency centres there is a lack of privacy, security and heating, while children are being denied access to education\. Especially where housing is provided through former military tents there is a lack of privacy and always noise\.


![source: [dutchnews\.nl](https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2021/12/refugee-charity-sounds-the-alarm-over-poor-conditions-in-emergency-centres/)](assets/8663f5476fae/1*WUvDgK2WnPo1wQypqiOPwQ.jpeg)

source: [dutchnews\.nl](https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2021/12/refugee-charity-sounds-the-alarm-over-poor-conditions-in-emergency-centres/)

The group is urging junior justice minister Broekers\-Knol to take action to make sure that accommodation for humans offers humane conditions\. Another problem in the Netherlands is the national housing shortage, which makes it hard to find a proper home for people who will eventually leave the camps once they have been granted a residency permit\.

[This Article](https://theconversation.com/friends-for-life-how-living-with-locals-helped-refugees-feel-at-home-in-a-new-country-172561) shares the development of the Dutch initiative [Takecarebnb](https://takecarebnb.org/en/) , which is tackling exactly the problem of housing\. While waiting for their own place to live, people who have already been granted a residency permit can be connected with Dutch hosts who are open to sharing their living space and time in the meanwhile\.
#### UK

**“Anti refugee bill” passes third reading**

Happening with very little media coverage as coinciding with a pandemic\-related scandal around last year’s government Christmas party: The infamous Nationality and Borders bill passes with 298 votes for by Johnson’s conservative party and 231 votes against by the opposition parties in the House of Commons\. It targets the hindrance of people crossing the English Channel and to criminalize those who try to reach the country that way, plus legalizing pushbacks when conducted against people who are detected in boats on the Channel\. It also aims to realize the offshore processing of asylum procedures for the UK\. [On how profitable the Bill could be for British finances](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/the-uk-government-is-looking-to-profit-from-closing-borders-to-asylum-seekers/) \.


■■■■■■■■■■■■■■

■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 


[**Asylum seekers in the UK will remain unable to work** after a long\-awaited Home Office review of the policy banning them from entering into employment concluded that it required “no further changes”\.](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/asylum-seekers-will-still-not-be-allowed-to-work-home-office-review-concludes-b1972000.html) Again, the foundation of the argumentation was the opinion that being able to work would be a strong factor for refugees to come to the UK, and that in fact an uncomfortable policy for asylum seekers would stop people choosing the dangerous route over the Channel — thus, accepting the ban as it is would in fact protect people\.


> After three years of this review, neither the Home Office nor its Ministers have been able to cobble together even the flimsiest piece of evidence that backs up this awful and nonsensical policy\. This ban creates misery for people who are often stuck for years in our asylum system and who could be integrating and contributing to their communities\. 





The review also stands in contrast to British politicians asking for asylum seekers to be integrated into the labour market\.

**Latest report on financial allowance for asylum seekers**

The Home Office has released [its 2020 report](https://www.statewatch.org/news/2021/december/uk-home-office-publishes-latest-report-on-financial-allowances-for-asylum-seekers/) into the pitiful living allowance paid to asylum\-seekers and failed asylum\-seekers, who are barred from working legally\.

**Former unaccompanied minors sent back**

[Britain has sent more than 100 asylum seekers back to Afghanistan and Iraq over the last five years after taking them in as unaccompanied children\.](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/britain-sends-more-100-asylum-25637633) All were given temporary leave to remain in the UK but were returned to their country of origin after turning 18\. According to legal experts, even in light of the Taliban takeover, there is no guarantee that those who arrived as unaccompanied children from Afghanistan will be allowed to stay\. Under current laws, unaccompanied children arriving in the UK are expected to make asylum claims the same way as adults — outlining exactly why returning to their home country would present a risk for them\.
#### DENMARK

**Germany declares Denmark unsafe**

[German court finds that Denmark can no longer be considered a “safe third country” under the Dublin Regulation due to the recent Danish practice of withdrawing protection from Syrian refugees\.](https://twitter.com/oldhumanitarian/status/1468182702838927361?t=RH0GWf4UMmMgXhT4BGDLCQ&s=19) Some of the Syrian refugees have fled to other European countries so they won’t be sent back to Syria\. Germany has now ruled that they cannot be sent back to Denmark, as would normally be the case, as Syria is not considered safe in terms of German migration policies\. [The country has now granted residence to several concerned people\.](https://www.weekendavisen.dk/2021-48/samfund/paa-flugt-fra-danmark)

Denmark is the only country in Europe that started withdrawing residency permits from people who fled Syria, with legal experts now raising their voices and proving that the latest rejections are [based on a false source of information](http://refugees.dk/en/focus/2021/december/legal-experts-syrian-withdrawal-cases-should-be-reopened/) \(just like an Eritrean report in 2014\) \.

This puts Denmark in the same category as Greece and Hungary: countries where the Dublin Regulation is in practice suspended, as they are not living up to the standards of asylum processing — even though they had at one time agreed to the Dublin Regulation\. Refugees\.dk reports about the development in full lenght [here](http://refugees.dk/en/focus/2021/december/legal-experts-syrian-withdrawal-cases-should-be-reopened/) \.

#### POLAND

**One girl missing**

Four\- [year\-old Eileen is missing in the woods\.](https://bialystok.wyborcza.pl/bialystok/7,35241,27885685,gdzie-jest-eileen-w-nocy-przy-polsko-bialoruskiej-granicy-zaginelo.html) The parents had been pushed back to Belarus, while the girl remained on the Polish side, which says just about everything about how the pushback has taken place\. Eileen was last been seen close to Nowy Dwór and is wearing a red jacket\. Since Monday, temperatures in the area at night have ranged between 0° and \-7 °C\.

**Financial and personnel help to keep border impassable**

Meanwhile, [**Czech Defense Minister Lubomir Metnar** said his government on Wednesday **approved the deployment of up to 150 soldiers** to aid Poland in stopping migrants seeking entry from Belarus\.](https://www.dw.com/en/poland-says-another-migrant-found-dead-near-belarus-border/a-60056480) If the parliament approves the plan, the Czech Republic will, next to Estonia and Britain, become the third country to consider and announce sending personnel help\. The Polish government estimates some 7,000 migrants are still in Belarus\.

Some good news about all that: Infomigrants lets Aldo from Cameroon and Bertrand from the Republic of the Kongo tell about their travels from their homes to Germany\. Interestingly enough, they report about an apparent network already existing to bring people over the Polish\-Belarusian border for money\. You will find the article [here](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/37055/through-gods-grace-african-migrants-arrive-in-germany-after-facing-abuse-in-belarus-and-poland) \.

Then the police arrived and arrested us\. We shouted ‘Asylum\!’ They said no\. — Aldo 




#### BELARUS

[“I am waiting for the **EU’s answer** to the question about the 2,000 refugees,” Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko told officials on Monday](https://www.dw.com/en/poland-says-another-migrant-found-dead-near-belarus-border/a-60056480) , referring to the **2000 people who have been “housed” in a warehouse** on the Belarusian side\. He said he had asked the European Union, Germany in particular, to “take these people off our hands\.” Outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel’s sole response has been that the situation in Belarus must be solved at the European level — go for it Germany, Europe, nothing more to say\.
