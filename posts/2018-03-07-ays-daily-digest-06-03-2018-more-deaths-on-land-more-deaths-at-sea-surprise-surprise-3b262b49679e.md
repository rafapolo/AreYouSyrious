#### FEATURE — 23 People died at sea yesterday, bringing the death toll for 2018 to 421

23 people are feared dead after a rubber dinghy and wooden boat capsized off the Libyan Coast on its way to Italy, according to [SOS Mediterranee](https://www.iol.co.za/news/africa/21-feared-dead-72-rescued-from-migrant-ships-off-libyan-coast-13620714) \. 72 persons have been rescued thus far\. The organisation says most persons were from West African countries\.

IOM reports that 21 missing people were among 51 on the wooden boat\. In addition, two infants were discovered dead on board — bringing the presumed death toll to 23\.

### Syria

Over 70 civilians died in Eastern Ghouta yesterday as airstrikes continued in the region, marking it the deadliest day in Syria since the 30 days ceasefire was called by the UN\.

At 10pm local time, reports were released of [a chlorine gas attack by the Syrian regime in the town of Hamoreyeh\.](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20180306-chemical-attack-on-ghouta-injures-dozens/) 30 civilians were evacuated and emergency workers were able to save them, despite many including children being close to suffocation\.

Furthermore, adding to the prolonged suffering, [a convoy filled with desperately needed medical supplies](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/syria-war-eastern-ghouta-sees-deadliest-day-battle-rages-180306063039157.html) and food evacuated before it was able to unload due to resumed shelling by Syrian Government forces\.


> As a result, nine trucks were prevented from unloading surgical supplies and medicines, as well as 5,500 bags of food and flour, enough to feed about 27,500 people\. 





Officials from international aid organisations confirmed that the government had blocked the offloading of about 70 percent of medical supplies, preventing trauma kits, surgical kits, insulin and other vital material from reaching the area\.


> Airstrikes continued as the UN and the ICRC entered Ghouta to deliver aid in the afternoon\. 70% of the convoy’s supplies were confiscated at regime checkpoints\. With more than 5,600 people injured over the last couple of weeks — and at least a dozen medical facilities damaged or destroyed — the trauma kits and surgical supplies that were taken by the regime were desperately needed by brave doctors and nurses working around the clock to save lives\. After making it aside, the UN convoy was forced to turn back early because of the bombing\. 14 of the 46 trucks that made it into Ghouta were not offloaded — [The Syria Campaign](https://www.facebook.com/TheSyriaCampaign/photos/a.608812989210718.1073741828.607756062649744/1688749317883741/?type=3&hc_location=ufi)

#### Greek Islands

Almost two years after the signing of the EU\-Turkey statement, thousands of people are still trapped on the Aegean islands in very poor conditions\. Over 200 are detained\.


[Nine organizations, among which the Greek Council for Refugees, continue the campaign for the decongestion of the islands](http://www.gcr.gr/index.php/en/news/press-releases-announcements/item/793-almost-two-years-after-eu-turkey-statement-people-are-still-trapped-on-the-islands) , which was launched in December, and urge the Greek government and the EU to end the containment policy\.

### Hungary

Hungarian Prime Minister; [Viktor Orbán’s government has been accused](https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-syrian-terrorism-trial-election-spotlight/) of using a terrorism case to boost anti\-migrant message, just one week before parliamentary election\.


> The court in the southern city of Szeged is due to give its verdict in the retrial of a Syrian man convicted of terrorism and jailed for 10 years for his role in a confrontation between police and asylum\-seekers on the border with Serbia in 2015\. 





Human Rights groups and EU officials have frequently condemned Hungary’s treatment of Ahmed H\., arguing that is senseless to charge him with terrorism over a altercation at the borders\. They state that this only highlights how Orbán’s government has exploited vulnerable people for its own political gains\.
### Austria

[A Kurdish family has been deported](http://burgenland.orf.at/news/stories/2899462/) from Austria to Bulgaria despite many locals in Burgenland attempting to prevent the deportation\.


> The mother was deported with the four children, at the age of 2\.5 to 11 years, without the family man, which I do not understand at all\. He is currently undergoing inpatient medical treatment in a hospital in Austria\. What I do not understand yet is that the family was deported to a country where they had to make traumatic experiences while fleeing\. They have been in jail before and have been mistreated\. 




### Germany

[Info Migrants have released a statement](http://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/7881/munich-integration-plan-successful-but-there-is-still-work-ahead) praising Munich for its attempts at integration despite challenges faced, however they also warn that there is still much work left to do\.

### Sweden

More than 1000 newly arrived people can lose their accommodation in Stockholm in 2018, according to Dagens Nyheter\. The paper has mapped the situation in Stockholms 26 different municipalities, and depending on political leadership in the municipalities, the situation for the people of concern can be different\. 15 out of 26 municipalities think that their responsibility to help provide housing ends after two years time\.

In Sweden, there is a “residence act”, which is laws about accommodation for newly arrived people, that says that during the establishment phase \(two years from the positive decision\), the responsible municipality has to provide housing\. After that, the family or person is considered to be just as any other Swedish person, which means that they will have to find their own apartment, house or accommodation\. Given the fact that the housing market, especially in Stockholm, is pure madness, as it is both expensive and a big lack of affordable apartments, this is very hard for those who don’t speak the language fluently, have no previous knowledge about Sweden and in many cases still are unemployed\. Some municipalities are doing a more narrow interpretation of the law, saying that the responsibility ends after two years, whereas some say that it won’t be possible for the people to find their own accommodations and will continue to provide help\. People pay the apartments by themselves anyhow, with money provided by the state\.

Different politicians with different belongings and agendas are of course motivating both the law and their interpretations of it in different ways\. One conservative/liberal \(Moderat\) politician claim that they knew the situation would get out of hand since promising to house for two years is to postpone problems \(since there is a big lack of housing in general\) \. In one municipality where they ended all contracts, the Green Party filed a lawsuit, the case will be up in court but it’s not clear when\.

Due to the big influx of refugees in 2015, and many decisions taken in 2016, this situation will just increase since a lot of people will finish the “establishment phase” in 2018\.

### Ireland

Syrian refugees in Roscommon are demanding that the Irish Red Cross stops managing their settlement cases\.

The group of 30 single residents have signed a letter that urges the Department of Justice to step in and take over control\.

The letter states that there has been ‘a lack of any progress in advancing their position, leaving them feeling like “prisoners in a plan” that is depressing their ability to join Irish society\.’

The full letter can be read [via this link\.](https://www.rte.ie/eile/2018/0305/945242-refugees-demand-irish-red-cross-stop-managing-settlement-cases/)
