### Feature

[A heart\-breaking testimony](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157569154768621&set=a.10150438475713621&type=3&theater) was shared from a woman who was among the 63 persons left stranded at sea for almost a week\. Due to the lack of assistance from the Maltese authorities, the woman witnessed 5 people on the boat die of thirst and exhaustion and 7 more people drown\. They were ultimately deported back to Libya and detained back in Tripoli’s inhumane Tariq Al Sikka detention centre\.


> “We have been in this place for about three years\. We were registered by the UNHCR in Sikka\. And we left Sikka feeling depressed and hopeless because we did not receive any assistance\. We were desperate and so we tried to get across the sea\. It was a pointless journey\. We were at sea for about seven days\. We were picked up on the seventh day and we were hopeful\. However, we were deported back to Libya without being told anything\. We returned to Libya and we’re back locked up in Sikka again\. We have returned to the place where we found no hope in the first place\. We have no idea what we are going to do\. Trying to get across the sea again sounds pointless because we have tried that and we were at sea for seven days with no food or water\. Our throats were so dry that we had no choice but to drink sea water\. 





> We are eight women in this place\. We are all trembling\. Some of us have sore bottoms\. Six of us are Eritreans, one of whom is a mother with a child\. The other two are, I think, South Sudanese\. One of them has a young child\. We are really all in a bad state of mind and our bodies are shaking because we have witnessed our brothers \(friends\) dying before our eyes\. They died due to starvation and depression\. It’s the same situation with the remaining people in this place\. Returning to Libya has been very difficult on all of us\. We left from this place initially because we had no hope here and we don’t think there is any hope for us here now\. One help that we desperately need, please help us to get out of this place called Libya\. We just ask to be moved to any place out of Libya where we can be safe, that’s the only thing that can give us peace\. 





> Apart from the seven days we had spent at sea, we had also stayed by the coast for three days\. We had not eaten any food during all that time\. This really had a terrible effect on us\. What made us lose hope further was seeing helicopters fly over us and not helping when we were left stranded at sea because the boat was out of fuel\. On top of that, strong waves made us feel seasick\. It was a hopeless situation dealing with all this and the hardships of going hungry and thirsty\. Everybody is feeling hopeless, hungry and thirsty to the extent that nobody has anything to say\. This is why some of our friends ended up dying\. There is nothing here that can make us resist, to the point that we have lost our appetite for food even though we are hungry\. Please help us because we desperately need help\.” 





Additionally, Alarm Phone has published a press release into how malta and EU authorities left people to die at sea and returned survivors to war\. The press release affirms that the inaction of authorities in Malta, Italy, Libya, Portugal, Germany, as well as the EU border agency Frontex caused the death of 12 people\. Alarm phone dispels the claims from the Maltese government and shows that the boat had drifted within the Maltese Search and Rescue \(SAR\) zone yet all relevant failed to intervene, using the COVID\-19 pandemic as an excuse to dramatically breach the law of the sea as well as human rights and refugee conventions\.

In the report, Alarm Phone offers a detailed reconstruction of the distressing case, showing clearly how it unfolded, and the ways in which Malta and other European authorities refused to rescue the people in distress\. The full report can be viewed below:

### Germany

[EUobserver](https://euobserver.com/coronavirus/148072?fbclid=IwAR02mqJBr8TpSLtqo1I7hoC5z1lWuuAdkpJe0qZZbJhY2AYM3fwTkpHCpdY) has reported that almost half of the 600 residents from the Ellwangen refugee camp in Baden\-Wurttemberg, Germany, have tested positive for COVID\-19\. In a damning example of the continued failings of the German state to protect the health of migrants and refugees, within Ellwangen camp people who have tested positive are still being forced to share facilities with everyone else\. All facilities are shared including bathrooms, showers, toilets and bedrooms\. The camp does not allow individuals to cook their own food and thus everyone must get their food in the canteen\.

Speaking under conditions of anonymity to the EUobserver a resident said _“everyone is scared to eat something because of crowds and we don’t know who has coronavirus or not”\._

Speaking out against the conditions of this camp, the Wurtemburg Refugee Council has demanded the eviction of the camp, but since the demand was first issued some three weeks ago, the proposal has still been ignored\. Since the facility first went into lockdown on the 5th of April after a 32\-year old man tested positive, the number of infections has since skyrocketed leading the police to continue imposing a forced lockdown of all residents\. In an unprecedented measure, the single WIFI hotspot had been switched off meaning that many residents are now unable to contact families, legal teams or find out more information about the ongoing crisis\.

_“They are seeing these people as a kind of threat and a danger, it seems to be an acceptable strategy to park the police outside and make sure nobody comes in and nobody comes out,”_ said Seán McGinley, a manager at the Baden\-Wurttemberg Refugee Council\.

Reports indicate that the camp had rented a facility to quarantine some camp residents if they fell sick, but the small size of the facility limits its capacity to 30 people and makes it useless when almost half of a 600 people camp have already tested positive\.

A group of refugee children evacuated from the refugee camps in Greece have finally arrived in Germany after weeks of debate and delays to their arrival to Germany\. Most of the 50 children who have arrived to Osnabrück, Germany are under 14\-years old\.

Osnabrück district administrator Anna Kebschull told DW “these children had to live in miserable and catastrophic conditions for many months and some of them lost their parents due to war or while fleeing,”\. The children are being provided with medical and psychological care but due to the ongoing COVID\-19 pandemic, the German Interior Ministry confirmed that all the children will be placed in a 14\-day quarantine before being taken to their final location in which they can get the care that they so rightfully deserve
### Austria

[The Austrian government](https://orf.at/stories/3162052/?fbclid=IwAR0fG1bCnnIupbTM2hL6d5wwvDCcpjTkNd8nitZAJl64IgbVhghHn1nAwkg) has planned to deport rejected asylum seekers to Serbia and even fund accommodation for them in the Balkans\. Reports have indicated that this agreement whilst virtually unknown to the public had been agreed by the Interior Minister Herbert Kickle and his Serbian counterpart a year ago\.

Karl Nehammer, the current Interior minister and successor to Kickl, said that _“foreigners staying illegally in Austria, for whom a legally binding return decision exists, provided that deportation to the country of origin is not possible and the foreigner has a sufficient connection to the Republic of Serbia ”\._

To date, no refugee has been deported under this agreement and many of the final details remain unclear\. The Austrian government has defended its decision by claiming that “many foreigners have sufficient ties to Serbia due to the escape via the Western Balkans route” referring to the transit route many refugees and migrants are forced to take when seeking safety\. Additionally, no sufficient answer has been provided as to where or how the individuals deported would be housed\. The Ministry of the Interior claims that they are considering an open form of accommodation that means that these individuals are not imprisoned, but have yet confirmed if they will be accommodated in existing refugee centres and facilities or if new facilities will be constructed\. The ministry of interior confirmed that Serbia is ultimately responsible for arranging the accommodation, but due to the recent allegations of police mistreatment in Serbian refugee centres, this news provides little relief\.
### Bosnia and Herzegovina

Exposing the harsh realities of the conditions that migrants and refugees are forced to endure, a video has been shared highlighting how 4 young boys are made to shelter in a shack next to an open rubbish dump\.


[![Security Check Required]( "Security Check Required")](https://www.facebook.com/lorena.fornasir/posts/2841397282644017)


[The Council of Ministers](https://www.nezavisne.com/novosti/drustvo/Ograniceno-kretanje-i-boravak-stranaca-u-BiH/594741?fbclid=IwAR3JiU4_tjaxCklA71WlyXdudo1rd_OveMpHeVAugMM9tm8zv5V850oHtWM) have acted on a proposal from the Ministry of Security and have approved new measures to restrict the movement and stay of foreign nationals without valid identification documents, can demonstrate that they are legally staying in BiH or have applied for asylum\.

These restrictions will prohibit the movement and stay outside the centres in which these foreign nationals are housed\. Anyone found breaching these rules, in accordance with the Law on Aliens will be transferred to the nearest temporary reception centre\. These restrictions are implemented on a provisional basis until the Council of Ministers decide that the reason for prescribing these measures has ceased\.
### Greece

[Aegean Boat report claim](https://twitter.com/teammareliberum/status/1250780835776733188?fbclid=IwAR0uzzUwbXCzsgD-7Oodi9tmUeMPFcKozO5BMhcYWZR8QfkYqJ8CpzrGfmM) that there have been no new arrivals on the Greek islands in the last week\. If true, this will be the first time since 2015\. Unfortunately, we know that this absence of new arrivals is not because safe and legal migrant routes have been opened but because the Greek coast guards have been ordered to prevent migrants from entering Greek waters using the pretext of COVID\-19 to justify their actions\.

Aegean Boat report has also shared a report into the experience of 131 people who have been abandoned at the point of arrival in Lesvos\. These people have been living outside for 25 days without any support from the authorities and with minimal assistance from UNHCR\.


[![Security Check Required]( "Security Check Required")](https://www.facebook.com/AegeanBoatReport/posts/812842672572172?hc_location=ufi)


[Human Right Watch](https://www.hrw.org/FreeTheKids?fbclid=IwAR09LK8JKRJrIlo64e0H15wia42ZGy8x1SuYBE-Jczhp41xld95I_7UTd1E) has urged the Greek government to release hundreds of unaccompanied children currently locked up in police cells\.

[HRW](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/watchdog-urges-greece-to-free-refugee-children/1804782?fbclid=IwAR1fmanrgtModOGU6FqkolQPu8i3-lE7hDk0VlNdrYeQ9GTNi_mr9iKU_b8) affirms that _“kids should be in safe, child\-friendly housing with the freedom to learn, play and thrive\. Yet, hundreds of migrant children in Greece without a parent or relative are sitting behind bars in police jails and immigration detention\. Their conditions create a heightened risk for contracting COVID\-19”_

The organisation believes that there are at least 331 children currently in police custody waiting for transfer to a shelter\. In addition to the psychological stress and the increased risk of contracting COVID\-19, HRW has documented instances of ill\-treatment by the police that these children have had to ensure\.

Human rights watch has asked the public to take action and ask **Greece’s Prime Minister to \#FreeTheKids\.**

### Sea

In an unprecedented move, Frontex has blocked its planes from appearing on tracking apps\. This comes just days after journalist Sergio Scandura identified that the flight path of a Frontex plane appeared to have circled the last known position of four refugee boats that coast guards from both Malta and Italy were refusing to rescue\.

[Frontex claim](https://twitter.com/saracreta/status/1250838493674246145?fbclid=IwAR0lwAUFkfzJ5N9NjiqHgT-L_aL6KOBPYbOb_nne0G9PyBVAFecHwU47upg) “It is general practice that the law enforcement assets are not made visible\. This might disclose such sensitive info as patrolling schedule/surveillance area thus undermining the ops objectives\.”

[This is not the first time that Frontex](https://euobserver.com/migration/147562) has taken steps to minimise accountability\. As previously reported by Are You Syrious, after winning a legal case against two pro\-transparency activists, Frontex sought to charge them their $24,000 legal bill\. The activist believed that this was a direct attempt to silence future critics\. Luisa Izuzquiza, one of the pro\-transparency activist told the EUobserver “our case was the first case against Frontex, so if this becomes the norm, having to pay five\-figure legal fees for taking them to court for a human rights case, then everyone is going to think twice”\. The two activist sought to legally compelled Frontex to provide them with information after failing to comply with freedom of information requests\.

In a new statement released by the Council of Europe’s Commissioner for Human Rights, it has confirmed that states should ensure rescue at sea and allow safe disembarkation during the COVID\-19 crisis\.

Dunja Mijatović, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights said that “Despite the unprecedented challenges European countries face due to COVID\-19, saving lives at sea and disembarking survivors in a safe port must continue”\.

The Commissioner calls on Council of Europe member states to promptly respond to any call of distress at sea, deploy the necessary rescue capacity in a timely manner, and effectively co\-operate to identify a place of safety where survivors can be disembarked, taking all necessary measures to protect the health of all involved\.

A boat of 29 people \(16 men and 13 women\) has been rescued 130 nautical miles from the Canary Islands\. This is the first boat to arrive on the island since April 5th\.
