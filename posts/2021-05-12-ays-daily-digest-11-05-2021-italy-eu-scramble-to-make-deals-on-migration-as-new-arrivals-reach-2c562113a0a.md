#### Italy, EU Scramble to Make Deals on Migration as New Arrivals Reach Lampedusa

During the weekend, over two thousand people arrived on the tiny Italian island of Lampedusa\. [20 more](https://twitter.com/AngiKappa/status/1392084116166823941?s=20&fbclid=IwAR1W8rMxZ-BzqbngF85BFbB6c2mkU50bVwr7-a49x-YjtDeUyYHiybGfwbc) people arrived on Tuesday\. With resources already stretched thin, the hotspot on Lampedusa is struggling to accommodate people\. As a result, many spent the night [on the streets](https://twitter.com/InfoMigrants/status/1392110744368336898?s=20&fbclid=IwAR0Fc97fthuOGsKMUbCluXspHR-cv_Zdxb89TKY3qViiA_3JFb4RFWK-cB4) before transfers to quarantine ships\. The situation was compounded by [strong winds](https://www.ansamed.info/ansamed/it/notizie/rubriche/cronaca/2021/05/11/migranti-svuotato-molo-a-lampedusa-oltre-mille-in-hotspot_08e0e989-b8a1-494c-8453-d3557a43aaf0.html?fbclid=IwAR33sfj6dXGNqmMQdRS1gv7hMQx13Of4ZzcBKovWLUk41xPb6L2g2VSAznA) , which prevented the arrival of a transfer ship to take people to the mainland\.

The Italian government announced that it will be launching a “ [control room](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/32126/italian-premier-plans-control-room-after-rise-in-migrant-landings?fbclid=IwAR3H-hqktQQeUpEwglUcyaB5m6FRF0ZF2rRNhM7-v4iKlxMvF53byXOhmW0) ” on immigration\. There is something worrying about the language of a crisis center being used about people in distress\.

The arrivals have exposed not only the lack of preparedness with which Italian authorities handled the situation, but the lack of a cohesive mechanism on the part of the EU for helping people on the move and member states\. Instead of having a system in place that mandates relocations, the bloc’s strategy was Ylva Johansson [asking member states](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/32147/migrants-reach-malta-eu-appeals-for-support-after-italy-arrivals?fbclid=IwAR18akaC76Zq_M76_b2Jne9p97AYg6ahjnPAQ41IIuqmCjcUfPZ0dBmoSbk) to step up voluntarily, which of course no country did\. Austria was the first to issue [an outright denial](http://A distribution (of the Lampedusa migrants) all over Europe is not an approach that will bring a solution) , with a statement from Karoline Edstadler, the country’s Europe minister, that, “a distribution \(of the Lampedusa migrants\) all over Europe is not an approach that will bring a solution\.” The Italian government repeated its calls for [structural change](https://www.ansamed.info/ansamed/it/notizie/rubriche/politica/2021/05/11/migranti-lamorgese-a-ue-servono-interventi-strutturali_d710f9ee-4098-461b-bf36-c6f86c414410.html?fbclid=IwAR0Yb3JhH0GHc--e_ooreX4Fsi5Dwv4HzJjvn9rJYlYP9xvGwKV7-bThKS0) that would create a solid solidarity mechanism, but it will likely fall on deaf ears\.

The new arrivals were allegedly used as an excuse for another political game\. The Italian newspaper [Repubblica](https://rep.repubblica.it/pwa/generale/2021/05/10/news/migranti_l_italia_vuole_un_secondo_accordo_sui_ricollocamnto_con_l_ue-300345374/) published a report claiming that Draghi’s government will ask the EU to hold a summit where it could decide to create a Turkey\-style deal with Libya, to [pay the country](https://www.efsyn.gr/kosmos/eyropi/293419_o-ntragki-proteinei-symfonia-la-toyrkia-gia-na-krata-i-libyi-toys-metanastes) to keep people on the move there\. Again, international organizations have long condemned Libya as an unsafe country for people on the move, so this alleged deal would be in violation of human rights\.

Draghi’s office denied that this proposal was under consideration\. However, an official said that the government thinks the EU should “be ready to offer financial help to all African countries involved in migrant flows\.” This does not rule out the possibility of more financial support for Libya\. It is also a sentiment widely shared in the EU, as Austria’s aforementioned minister also said that her government would support giving aid to African countries so that people stay there\. Ylva Johansson also said that the bloc needs to prevent departures when she was asked about the possibility of a [European\-wide rescue organization](https://euobserver.com/migration/151824?fbclid=IwAR2gymWCnFhcGw9T9aA3esuHnatFWT4kVt0AmEvzK7xIeHmVohTZjW8yTZ4) \.

There has been widespread evidence that extensive aid actually does little to stop migration and often gets misused by corrupt politicians\. Many of the thousands of euros Italy has already given to Libya never made it to the people they were supposed to help\. Yet European countries cling to this failing policy instead of admitting its failings, or better yet, spending money on directly helping people on the move\.

While Europe plays political games with resettlements and financial aid to governments which serially violate human rights, people’s lives are at stake\. People are languishing in camps, people are [dying at sea](https://ilmanifesto.it/sbarchi-autonomi-e-morti-nel-mare-senza-ong/?fbclid=IwAR0j-iw2hz-WlSnl3ERq616aOjEjP5-a0OcWfNQw1D2lklamz9Mch_1-YeM) because there is nobody, besides a few NGO ships constantly [under threat of administrative detention](https://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2021/05/11/news/l_appello_delle_ong_all_italia_liberate_le_navi_umanitarie_non_sacrificare_la_vita_di_centinaia_di_persone_-300488537/?ref=RHTP-BH-I295744712-P12-S2-T1&__vfz=medium%3Dsharebar&fbclid=IwAR0nxTS4PV5ayOnNCXRz5tIyx10_ynh5Z6TdxaQHsw1J62K31TOaCmlW8lM) , to help them\. This is not the time for political spats\.
#### MOROCCO
#### Stop Persecuting Helena Maleno\!

Organizations representing Arab and African people condemned the [Moroccan government’s persecution](https://caminandofronteras.org/organizaciones-arabes-y-africanas-exigen-a-marruecos-que-permita-a-helena-maleno-defender-los-derechos-humanos/?fbclid=IwAR1SBrLWGClHaZ3hrwcm7aqujUJSjWVnZWHNDYDS9RZ0hWoX6tXsNS7y-mQ) of Helena Maleno, the CEO of Caminando Fronteras\. A few months ago, Maleno was deported from Morocco after an hours\-long ordeal where she was separated from her child and denied her basic needs\. This is only the latest judicial attempt from Morocco and Spain to stop her work and that of other activists\.
#### LIBYA
#### Embarrassing Accounts of Libyan Trafficker’s Release

Last month, authorities in Libya released accused trafficking boss and major in the Libyan Coast Guard, Abdurahman al\-Milad “Bija\.” He is still wanted by Interpol\.

With his release, other embarrassing details came out\. As recently as 2017, when information about his crimes was already widely known, Bija participated in a series of meetings in Italy\. The Italian government subsequently claimed that he entered the country using fraudulent documents, but recent reports have proved that he used [his authentic passport](https://www.avvenire.it/attualita/pagine/e-ora-l-onu-smentisce-definitivamente-l-italia-bija-arrivo-con-un-passaporto-autentico?fbclid=IwAR00BbeGNP5c_6AoXLo9loLrfeVpEY7tedNKa0pzYbYegY9alLOOvooifrU) and was granted entry anyway\. This casts further suspicions on the close ties between European governments and some high\-powered officials in the Libyan forces\.

[42 people](https://twitter.com/rgowans/status/1392137250843004930?s=20&fbclid=IwAR09GV_YrXVzZfhp69IXhWtrCxEAenxA9xLSl0QVENKdtDoGvzG1Y8FHAJU) were pulled back to Libya earlier today after being rescued at sea\. The Coast Guard said that about 26 people are missing and presumed dead from the same wreck\.
#### SYRIA
#### Three People Dead in IDP Camp Fire

Three people, [including one child](https://news.sn4hr.org/2021/05/11/two-women-and-a-child-died-by-fire-in-an-idp-camp-in-n-idlib-on-may-10/?fbclid=IwAR3F3lG3W6ncjuRdzP1OEeRYcaKHLTs7yelfPKvK9OzQZf8hT-p51kGTvlU) , have died in a fire in an IDP camp near to Idlib in Syria\. The two women who died were both pregnant\. The fire broke out from a gas oven that the women were using to cook with\. These deadly tragedies are unfortunately common where people do not have access to basic resources such as safe cooking facilities\.
#### SEA
#### About 70 People Reach Malta

After a rare rescue mission by the Maltese armed forces, a group of about [70 people](https://www.reuters.com/world/dozens-migrants-land-malta-after-sea-rescue-2021-05-11/?fbclid=IwAR2j6ccDboWtgCwUsJp5pE_eJxICdE_HZjNgOGVMNi_Y4_m6rPm5C5WKmSI) reached the relative safety of Malta\.

The tragic fate of many others who did not survive the same crossing has been visible in recent days\. In Libya, the bodies of people who perished at sea have recently been [washing up onshore](https://twitter.com/msehlisafa/status/1392038390737117184?s=20&fbclid=IwAR0oOoBW8bV0gdVCi-EzD71tsPNTpOVKpnrmkF9at1Yj5bgo70xuHZ5yLJI) \.
#### GREECE
#### Greece Proposes Expansion of Frontex Outside of Europe’s Borders

At a meeting in Lisbon, the Minister of Immigration and Asylum, Notis Mitarakis, called for Frontex’s expansion [in his speech](https://twitter.com/migrationgovgr/status/1392127727600390144) \. He primarily called for more externalization, such as putting Frontex operations into more third countries and more patrols outside of [Europe’s territorial waters](https://migration.gov.gr/gia-tin-ellada-i-katapolemisi-tis-paratypis-metanasteysis-apotelei-kyriarchi-proteraiotita/) \.
#### Fire in Vial

A fire broke out in [Vial camp](https://astraparis.gr/pyrkagia-se-kleisto-oikisko-sti-vial/?fbclid=IwAR0sshCNeVKS9QICHrUyF6IQ7GHwLrbBS6nbzqmQeK9kmccoHaUCpai9468) on Chios in the old house for minors\. Thankfully nobody was hurt\.

In Sappho Square on Lesvos, home to [many members](https://twitter.com/katymfallon/status/1392186328863977475) of the Hazara community, there was a candlelit vigil for victims of the terrorist attack in Kabul targeting Hazara schoolgirls last week\.

■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 


Also on Lesvos, [over 30 people](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/32137/more-than-30-covid-cases-in-lesbos-migrant-camp?fbclid=IwAR03VXcKvnl5JC6ajQ_gNNnrzXQnPv88vBuiXxcg2IzdSFeHWgNB6HuqnGA) have tested positive for Covid\-19 in Moria 2\.0 and are quarantining along with their families\.
#### SERBIA
#### Pushbacks on the Hungarian and Romanian Border

From our friends at Info Park:


> Over the past two weeks Hungarian authorities prevented 2,684 attempts of irregular border crossing, according to Info Park’s sources\. Despite high numbers, most of the people interviewed by Info Park’s team in Belgrade stated that they intend to continue their journey through Romania\. Furthermore, Info Park noted an increase in the number of families which try to cross into Romania by boats across the Danube river\. On 27 April a Kurdish family with three children aged from 7 months to 6 years, shared with the Info Park’s team that they already had several unsuccessful attempts to cross into Romania, so this time the smuggler organized the “game” \(irregular border\-crossing\) using a boat across the Danube\. Over the following two weeks, several other families, mostly from Syria and Iraq, shared similar stories\. Info Park’s protection officers spoke with the beneficiaries about the risks of such modes of traveling and related consequences, but most of the people said that the smugglers make the decisions, and they have no other choice\. 





> People on the move in Serbia\. On 7 May Serbian Commissariat for Refugees and Migration \(SCRM\) reported on the latest Child Protection Working group that there are currently 5,531 refugees and other migrants residing in Serbia\. Out of that number, 4,773 people on the move are accommodated in asylum and reception centers\. Most of the people are nationals of Afghanistan 35%, Syria 20%, Pakistan 11%, Bangladesh 10% and Iraq 5%\. Additionally, the SCRM stated that the centers on the northern border are accommodating disproportionately larger number of people than the centers in the South\. According to the officials, the reason is that most of the push\-backed people go directly to nearby camps or are taken there by the border police\. On the other hand, there is a growing dissatisfaction among the refugees and other migrants accommodated in official centers due to the over\-crowdedness, poor hygiene conditions within the camps and cases of mistreatment by the SCRM staff\. As a result of this, more and more people are leaving the centers to reside in the borderlands, find private accommodation or sleep rough while attempting to continue their journey\. 




#### CROATIA
#### Police Expelling LGBT Asylum Seekers

Despite the well\-founded, documented dangers they would be in if returned to their home countries, three LGBT asylum seekers were [pushed back to Bosnia & Herzegovina](https://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/policija-iz-hrvatske-protjerala-lgbt-ljude-ako-se-vrate-u-svoju-zemlju-idu-u-zatvor/2275082.aspx?index_tid=116106&fbclid=IwAR0JXrktnuu_I7gEoHWnxia9Q7d21sC0NwhW_NxWZ9bkPV5EGKELhrNSmYo) from Croatia\. The three people were arrested after they went to formally seek asylum at the police station, as is their right by international law\.

Of course, the police forces are denying that this incident happened, despite the fact that the people were accompanied by activists to the police station and photographed in front of it\. However, the office of the public defender has said they are already in contact with the people and will be pursuing the case\.

Unfortunately, it is all too common for Croatian police to deport people when they seek asylum instead of hearing out their case\. This situation was unique because the peoples’ sexual orientation makes them extra vulnerable to dangers on the route and to persecution or even death if they are deported to their home countries\.
#### SPAIN
#### Closure of Plaza de Toros in Melilla

Yesterday at midnight, the temporary shelter [Plaza de Toros closed](https://twitter.com/SolidaryW/status/1392135717023780869) , leaving over 120 people out on the street\. Plaza de Toros was notorious for being an unsanitary no\-mans\-land for people who got kicked out of accommodation once they turned 18, but it was still the only home many people had access to\. Yesterday, people were told to leave because they could have accommodation at the CETI, but when they arrived, only registered asylum seekers were allowed in\. The police also arrived and interrogated them\. This morning, the people protested in front of the Ministry of Economy and Social Policies to denounce the lack of options that they are given\.

Some are wondering if this bizarre operation was supposed to expel people from the Plaza just like the police raid last month\.

The Spanish Ombudsman is calling on the Ministry of Social Rights to [improve the protection](https://elpais.com/espana/2021-05-11/el-defensor-del-pueblo-pide-a-belarra-que-lidere-las-mejoras-en-la-atencion-de-los-menores-inmigrantes.html?fbclid=IwAR3UbmND5hZ9mX8zrY9qkSgkGel1luGmNmGkhr7ZUsCRThEN0CBS6rrr1UE) of minors who are on the move\. Her recommendations include improving the situation on the Canary Islands, creating an actual plan to help minors integrate, and giving children the specialized care that they need\.
#### NETHERLANDS
#### Anti\-Immigrant Party Looking to Follow Danish Example

A member of PVV, the main far\-right party in the Netherlands, asked the State Secretary for Justice and Security if the government [plans to deport Syrians](https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/kv-tk-2021Z07453.html?fbclid=IwAR2NJG1YD4J7YdNduNWf7T0MWISJ5HIvp092lAEl57TfTL50ONm7JfFMvy0) once their home country is safe\. Markuszower also asked if the government would be willing to withdraw dual citizenship from Syrian nationals and claimed that it had given away too many passports to Syrians\.

During his question, the MP explicitly [cited the Danish example](https://twitter.com/TihomirSabchev/status/1392176429127933959?fbclid=IwAR2HUNOO0qUmlQ9WNpZzbo4BPzScwzudNAsmp5vOiP0ZUQ7_GGtqAdyVnuU) as one that the Netherlands should follow\. Denmark’s decision that parts of Syria are safe despite clear evidence to the contrary endangers not only Syrians living in Denmark, but those all over Europe who are now in danger from far\-right parties\.
#### IRELAND
#### Asylum Seeking Healthcare Workers Denied Housing

Ireland has a temporary accommodation scheme where it provides healthcare workers that are also asylum seekers with housing during the pandemic\. However, the Health Service Executive in Galway [sent threatening letters](https://www.rte.ie/news/connacht/2021/0511/1220864-asylum-seekers-hse-accommodation/?fbclid=IwAR3k7eV_6uHiTPnHmHymjAFV5JYjlGFhSuOw96WLjyT0H6ry6tzrxJwm4WQ) in April warning people that the scheme could cease at any time and gave them until the end of the month to secure alternative housing\.

Galway is the site of a serious housing crisis, particularly for people with low incomes such as nursing home workers or asylum seekers\. The workers reported that this has increased their stress levels, which, for frontline workers during a pandemic, was already high\.
#### UK
#### Reactions to Queen’s Speech, Patel’s Plan

During the Queen’s Speech, Queen Elizabeth II officially announced the Home Secretary Priti Patel’s plan to move forward with proposed legislation to change the immigration system, despite widespread outrage during the sham public commentary period\. Proposals include refusing the asylum application of anyone that has passed through a safe third country, stripping people of benefits even if they cannot be deported, limiting family reunification provisions, and creating a two\-tier system which prevents asylum seekers who arrive in the UK via irregular routes from gaining full refugee protection\.

Through the mouth of the Queen, the government states that the plan is a way to establish a “ [fairer immigration system](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/asylum-immigration-plans-queens-speech-home-office-uk-b1845487.html?fbclid=IwAR3F3lG3W6ncjuRdzP1OEeRYcaKHLTs7yelfPKvK9OzQZf8hT-p51kGTvlU) ”\. Others know better\.

Tim Naor Hilton of Refugee Action [said](https://www.refugee-action.org.uk/queens-speech-governments-cruel-asylum-plans-undermine-international-and-moral-obligation-to-refugees/?fbclid=IwAR3db8xkP0bdemkdXdUVxxvxuyg6-A6Vo5NMiAxmBYZnAJCo2rfK31ESsAQ) :


> “Priti Patel’s cruel, unworkable and potentially unlawful plans bulldoze the right to claim asylum and tear up our international and moral obligations to some of the world’s most vulnerable people\.” 





The Refugee Council, the UNHCR, the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, and Safe Passage International also condemned the plan\.
#### EU/FRONTEX
#### Lighthouse Reports testifies in front of the European Parliament

[Reporters from Lighthouse Reports](https://www.lighthousereports.nl/lighthouse-investigators-testify-at-european-parliament/?fbclid=IwAR0ZtmRbKIZKzTl326IDVUvymitp5MparUmOY5fvjaFewDSGVF6coaGC_LY) testified in front of the European Parliament in the investigation into Frontex’s involvement in pushbacks in the Aegean Sea\. Lighthouse Reports also recently published another joint investigation into Frontex’s role in pushbacks in the central Mediterranean\.

Meanwhile, two documents on asylum regulation and voluntary returns are making their way t [hrough the Council](https://www.statewatch.org/news/2021/may/eu-tracking-the-pact-council-papers-on-common-asylum-procedure-and-voluntary-return-and-reintegration/?fbclid=IwAR1Brzq3nMqJZuhM7aOTtGGWumq9ipkd6SwN_hbiWcOoPImqRtdj07pbZCI) \. The European Commission also issued a recommendation that the Council [authorize further cooperation](https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/default/files/pdf/14042021_recommendation_for_a_council_decision_com-2021-177-1_en.pdf?fbclid=IwAR06XSZT3FEDBCoE5hfPXnwEt09r6bodQYUJIwWKdzSnOkTgvoBDE-jbkD0) between Frontex and Interpol, increasing Frontex’s access to Interpol’s massive databases\.
#### WORTH READING

Our friends at ECRE released their latest press review, which you can read [here](https://mailchi.mp/ecre/ecre-press-review-11052021?fbclid=IwAR1XksgqiiU4FEDrGThxnQm9aWFwUUyFXNE-3OkGhAaDbEmcz0PSL4Eo_Jc) \. Highlights include revelations of collusion between Frontex and Libya, originally reported by Der Spiegel, 2,000 deaths at sea linked to European pushbacks, and more\.

[This article](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/32146/migrants-drugs-and-money-spotlight-on-illicit-business-in-the-western-balkans?fbclid=IwAR1wWUnp8YBBcPFsDXjzkdgWLsG7bcHBFMFlznrXby53-_Rg16V1U4qKqAw) talks about the vast amounts of money involved in smuggling and other criminal activities in the Western Balkans\. The lucrative underground smuggling trade could be minimized or eliminated entirely if people on the move had an option to migrate legally\.
