### AYS Daily Digest 3/26/19: New Report on Torture in Libya
### Libya

The Women’s Refugee Commission [released](https://www.womensrefugeecommission.org/news/press-releases-and-statements/3460-new-research-shows-widespread-sexual-violence-torture-against-refugee-and-migrant-men-and-boys-in-libya-and-along-the-central-mediterranean-route-to-italy?fbclid=IwAR0CH7VC8QvNbeosYE8DGkCwcul5CpqITVf3zx-olbxMVMzxAWoz-r7BEdA) a report about sexual violence and torture against men and boys in Libya and along the Mediterranean route to Italy:


> Refugees and migrants are exposed to sexual violence throughout the course of their journey from fleeing home, during the crossing of the Sahel, to being held in Libya, where they face harrowing conditions, and even onto Italy — for the few that make it that far — where for some the cycle of violence continues\. 





The field research among more than 120 people, including aid workers, service providers and guardians, shows that sexual violence against men and women is a widespread phenomenon all along the route, including in Italy\.


> The study found that sexual violence perpetrated against migrants and refugees along the Mediterranean route includes sexual torture, genital violence and castration, and forcing men and boys to rape others — including family members and corpses — as well as lethal sexual violence\. 





Meanwhile, the World Health Organization [released](https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/WHO%20Libya%20distributes%20critically%20%20needed%20emergency%20medical%20supplies%20to%20major%20hospitals%20in%20Libya.pdf?fbclid=IwAR0kRgfcUvlqyPMVZ3SkKFmMaaZKn-FwziBCawKttqNkbOKr86GRyDpEHCo) 10 trucks loaded with emergency medical supplies and trauma kits to reach 10 major hospitals in different districts of Libya on March 23\.
