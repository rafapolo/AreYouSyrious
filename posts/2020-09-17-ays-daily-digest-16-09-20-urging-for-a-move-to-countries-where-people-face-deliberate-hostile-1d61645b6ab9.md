#### European Countries Agreed to Take in People From Moria\. But What Will Happen to Them Afterwards?

After the fire that destroyed Moria, countries in the European Union agreed to accept former residents of the camp which some are hailing as a gesture of European solidarity\. However, the way many of these states treat people on the move already in their country raises uncomfortable questions about what awaits people once they get there\.

France was one of the nations leading the call to take in unaccompanied minors, along with Germany\. However, people on the move in France face a hostile, deliberate policy of “ [no welcome,](https://www.facebook.com/asso.utopia56/posts/3565489700149463) ” which aims to make it difficult for people to access their right to asylum through creating conditions of poverty and constant police harassment\. Many unaccompanied children, from the beaches of Calais to the streets of France’s major cities, are homeless as a result of this policy\. The constant expulsions in Calais, another of which took [place yesterday](https://twitter.com/HumanRightsObs/status/1305956837888589824?fbclid=IwAR0fAtGI1grxj81psr81OsD3BwUYJaAzzi188X7usSyl5ZJYBZ88hXL4p2g) , are another example of this policy\. Even in Paris, people are forced to live in hostile conditions\. [“We live worse than dogs,](https://www.lepoint.fr/societe/une-situation-intenable-dans-l-enfer-d-un-camp-aux-portes-de-paris-13-09-2020-2391643_23.php?fbclid=IwAR0fAtGI1grxj81psr81OsD3BwUYJaAzzi188X7usSyl5ZJYBZ88hXL4p2g#) ” is how people living in a camp by the Saint\-Denis canal describe their situation\. The people are camping by the side of a noisy highway, with no access to jobs, training including language classes, or other support\. They are vulnerable to attacks by local criminals who rob them of what little possessions they have\. Several people in the Saint\-Denis camp have already received their asylum decisions, but not the social support they are entitled to along with them\.


> It was easier in Moria\. At least there, I had language courses and I could do odd jobs\. Here, there is nothing for us\. 





Will the people coming to France from Moria also be victims of the “no welcome” policy that sees them cast out into the streets once their usefulness in the headlines is over?

Another example of publicity\-washing comes from Horst Seehofer, Germany’s Minister of the Interior, who called the commitment to accept 408 families with children “a great gesture of humanity\.” However, Seehofer initially dragged his feet on accepting people in favor of waiting for an EU\-wide mechanism, and had to be called upon by cities and other politicians to make this “great gesture of humanity\.” Additionally, most people already [had the right to come](https://twitter.com/DunyaCollective/status/1306182009635713026?fbclid=IwAR2eIO3agBm924z9L5vZLfCbtT3_PeHPNOoYpWXU2Hs2cujpAfgTEkdjPps) but were kept in Greece unnecessarily\. This was less a grand gesture of humanity, but a belated fulfillment of basic human rights for asylum seekers\.

Countries are quick to publicize their involvement in the relocation efforts from Moria, even when those numbers are ridiculously low, such as Belgium’s initial, proud announcement that it will accept [twelve children](https://twitter.com/keeptalkingGR/status/1305881315934380033) \. That’s barely enough to field a football team\! Later, the government agreed to accept an additional [100 to 150 “vulnerable” people](https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2020/09/16/belgie-wil-100-tot-150-asielzoekers-uit-grieks-vluchtelingenkamp/?fbclid=IwAR2pHy2f2rAGH53eAfDr3I7XbLs-XmpIcu0Aqzt6jwy4slYigZr4NiQEs-M) , although a country as wealthy as Belgium can and should do more\.

The Netherlands agreed to take in 100 people, of whom 50 are minors, but only those [under the age of 14, in a decision criticized by Unicef\.](https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2020/09/take-in-older-lesbos-refugee-children-too-unicef-official-urges-the-netherlands/?fbclid=IwAR1KglYSk_S1_WVVzxMozx_4vt-rrOw6KG-b1m2I8ZX2e17RnicvG465-ls) Children between the ages of 14 and 18 are minors as well and also need protection—in fact, 80% of the unaccompanied minors in Moria are over 14\. Not only is this a clear shirking of responsibility, it plays into the racist trope where Black and Middle Eastern children are treated as adults and accused of lying about their age by asylum authorities\. Another caveat that was hidden in the original announcement of the deal was that the Netherlands will now take 100 fewer recognized refugees out of warzones next year\. The grand total of people they were going to accept originally? 500\.

It seems as if for European governments, the homeless people in Moria are nothing but a means to secure a place in the humanitarian limelight\. While countries are eager to publicize how many people they will be taking from Moria, they do nothing to care for people already in their territory\. The “generous” offers of most European countries are also riddled with selective criteria: they will only accept unaccompanied minors, or families with children, or Christians\. This is calculated to play into our ideas of what “vulnerable people” look like to extract maximum pathos from news headlines, but also feeds into the idea that people on the move who do not fit neatly into the box of “vulnerable migrants” are dangerous\. In reality, people on the move who are adults, who are men, who are Muslim also deserve a safe place to live and should not be left on the streets of Lesvos\. The policy of “women and children only” should have gone down with the Titanic\.

Of course, we sincerely hope that for the hundreds of people that are getting relocated, this will mean a fresh start\. However, we must be vigilant and ensure that once the headlines die down, they are treated properly in their new homes, and that states aren’t using the goodwill generated by news of resettlement to hide the abuses they commit against people without papers\. When the focus is on the utility of people on the move, whether to generate sympathetic headlines or [prop up European health care systems](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-09-syrian-refugee-health-workers-europe.html?fbclid=IwAR3RQb_HyB8DSBwfDzPe-5aNwjsY0eowngQH7CNCKwU2rurvZLiLEEeMlsU) , their humanity falls by the wayside\.
#### SYRIA
### Assad’s regime possibly to face consequences at court

The first trial [worldwide on state torture in Syri](https://twitter.com/SJAC_info/status/1306221273060487170?fbclid=IwAR1KglYSk_S1_WVVzxMozx_4vt-rrOw6KG-b1m2I8ZX2e17RnicvG465-ls) a is being held—in Koblenz, Germany\. Germany claims Universal Jurisdiction over the most serious crimes and can try human rights violators regardless of their nationality\. This case could be the first time a member of Assad’s regime faces consequences for their acts\. However, while some members of Assad’s regime are facing trial in Germany, others, including high\-ranking members of the security apparatus, [walk freely in German streets](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-refugees-syria-bashar-assad/a-54678433?fbclid=IwAR0PxTHkJDwgIUtGxQs3ouGxi_BhEcSlXCgEGO5bspXUYiIMiNni_b3RNJg) while their victims jump through hoops to get their asylum\.
#### CYPRUS
### Illegal pushbacks

Cyprus is conducting [illegal pushbacks](https://www.dw.com/en/refugee-pushbacks-by-cyprus-draw-attention-from-eu-un/a-54908678?fbclid=IwAR2t6eP4k6guO5ATrVQL5EgHs9o-jPPsKRsMxo_ORY9os63_rc7--J4djn8) , drawing the attention of the international community\. Citing the pandemic as their excuse, the government has been intercepting boats and turning them back to Lebanon instead of allowing people to apply for asylum \(apparently, COVID\-19 is a means\-tested disease because Cyprus reopened for tourism in June\. Some travelers are more accepted than others\! \) \. Interior Minister Nicos Nouris went as far as calling arrivals from Lebanon “a targeted attempt” against his country and saying, “we cannot and don’t have any room\.”
#### GREECE
### “Solutions” posing more questions

Greek minister Michalis Chrysochoidis told _The Guardian_ that all people on the move will be [resettled from Lesvos by Easter](https://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2020/09/16/greece-refugees-lesvos-permanent-camp/) \. However, this raises more questions than it answers\. Currently there are around 12,000 people on Lesvos and moving them all will take a gargantuan effort and ideally, EU cooperation that has not exactly been forthcoming until now, but there are no plans as to where these people will go yet\. Additionally, if the plan is to clear the island by Easter, why is the Greek government building a closed structure right now just to shut it down in a few months? Finally, will the people themselves get a say in where they will go?

Chrysochoidis’ claim is countered by a leak that the national government [allegedly leased land](https://twitter.com/Hibai_/status/1306116603508150273) around Kara Tepe until 2025\. Notis Mitarakis himself did not mention anything about clearing Lesvos in a statement published on his website, instead he said the fire proves that open centers should be replaced by [closed ones with double fencing](https://twitter.com/g_christides/status/1306157531295879168?fbclid=IwAR2NOufuWEx18cmk1cHKKELAB7HyW9csC4iFQNi6UXEsWs4DV5gywVhc_wM) \.

Meanwhile, people are slowly filtering back into the makeshift camp at Kara Tepe\. The camp looks as if it’s going to be [larger than Moria](https://twitter.com/Hibai_/status/1306120335004229632?fbclid=IwAR2NOufuWEx18cmk1cHKKELAB7HyW9csC4iFQNi6UXEsWs4DV5gywVhc_wM) and even more crowded—there is little distance between the tents and few bathrooms are visible in what photos journalists were able to take\. This goes against FEANTSA and the Greek Housing Network’s [call for dignified housing](https://www.feantsa.org/en/news/2020/09/15/immediate-action-needed-ensure-dignified-accommodation-for-asylum-seekers-and-refugees-formerly-residing-in-the-moria-reception-identification-centre?bcParent=26) for the people of Moria\. The camp is on top of an old shooting range, and people have already found remnants of old weapons\. People are [washing themselves in the sea](https://twitter.com/rspaegean/status/1306330632730148864?fbclid=IwAR2NOufuWEx18cmk1cHKKELAB7HyW9csC4iFQNi6UXEsWs4DV5gywVhc_wM) as they have no access to proper sanitary facilities or a change of clothes\. The tents [have no beds](https://twitter.com/rspaegean/status/1306301897368797187?fbclid=IwAR1y4uEb0Wi8E5naiJqvz435yPs4tOiB8ATT02p5z7XZ1GHhBpyCRujSQRw) , not even for older people or those with disabilities\. We still do not know the full details about conditions in the camp as journalists still have limited access, despite calls from international organizations such as [Media Freedom Rapid Response](https://www.ecpmf.eu/concerns-over-access-for-media-workers-in-greece/) \.

The tents in the camp are crammed together, leaving people vulnerable to fire or disease\. [Already 39 people](https://twitter.com/rspaegean/status/1306299850418458625?fbclid=IwAR2_GeSmIKIkd-bND1X7NSQaHdvkiE2MZqlXJP5MYQjrwVLn7bUjrU9SBpE) tested positive for coronavirus out of the fewer than 2,000 who have resettled in Kara Tepe and were taken to a separate quarantine facility\. Many families are worried about going into the camp for various, valid concerns, such as inadequate housing\. The Greek government’s response? They are sending [more female police officers](https://twitter.com/Malichudis/status/1306112410831515648?fbclid=IwAR2o1uZPrWrMMwd4pJ9cLJUn_so_d43R6TqDYTnb0YTjka6_sn6h-pAU5E0) \.

Thousands of people are still sleeping rough on the roads around the camp as documented by a [report by Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/09/16/greece/eu-bring-moria-homeless-safety) \. Aid workers are [having trouble](https://twitter.com/belkiswille/status/1306141483473317889?fbclid=IwAR2NOufuWEx18cmk1cHKKELAB7HyW9csC4iFQNi6UXEsWs4DV5gywVhc_wM) distributing food and water due to the sheer amount of people in need\. They have no access to bathrooms or showers and are vulnerable to attacks by police and vigilantes alike\. MEP Erik Marquardt called for cruise ships to be [used as temporary housing](https://www.stuttgarter-nachrichten.de/inhalt.nach-brand-in-moria-europaabgeordneter-fluechtlinge-auf-kreuzfahrtschiffen-unterbringen.1ab1c3f7-11c4-419c-969a-e1bdb21062d9.html?fbclid=IwAR0laNJcKreCJzfNQhEuKbqQYmXhS_x9LRhUsuhuBOxL-mfuuMMUDiLCDyk) , but cruise ships cannot provide dignified, long\-term housing for people—the clear solution is relocation\. The EU and Greece should act quickly to provide safe, dignified housing for people, not strand them in the streets or force them into yet another crowded camp built on polluted ground\.

In the aftermath of the Samos fire last night, [several men were arrested](https://twitter.com/samosvolunteers/status/1306159060404887553?fbclid=IwAR2NOufuWEx18cmk1cHKKELAB7HyW9csC4iFQNi6UXEsWs4DV5gywVhc_wM) for allegedly starting the fire\. However, at least some of the men were trying to put out the fire and help keep the camp safe\. A lawyer is working to help free them, but they should never have been arrested in the first place\. In response to this fire and the one in Moria, the Greek police’s response is clear—arrest first, ask questions later\. This also allows the authorities to publicize the arrests even with no evidence, to continue portraying people on the move as dangerous criminals, and to justify the need for closed centers\.

Samos police has a history of violence against people on the move\. On 2 September, [two minors were arrested](https://tvxs.gr/news/ellada/samos-kataggelies-gia-kakometaxeirisi-anilikon-prosfygon-apo-astynomikoys) while they were waiting to use an ATM\. They were [stripped and beaten](https://twitter.com/PsiAction/status/1306301022877425669?fbclid=IwAR2NOufuWEx18cmk1cHKKELAB7HyW9csC4iFQNi6UXEsWs4DV5gywVhc_wM) by police before they were released, with no explanation as to why they’d been arrested\. Clearly this was just a sadistic abuse of power\.

The Samos hotspot, along with Leros and Kos, are [currently in quarantine](https://twitter.com/rspaegean/status/1306159272246550528?fbclid=IwAR2NOufuWEx18cmk1cHKKELAB7HyW9csC4iFQNi6UXEsWs4DV5gywVhc_wM) after a few positive cases of coronavirus were detected\.

In Evros, a farm car carrying eighteen people on the move fell off a bridge into a stream\. [Eleven people](https://www.evros-news.gr/2020/09/16/%ce%b1%ce%bb%ce%b5%ce%be%ce%b1%ce%bd%ce%b4%cf%81%ce%bf%cf%8d%cf%80%ce%bf%ce%bb%ce%b7-%cf%80%ce%bf%ce%bb%ce%bb%ce%bf%ce%af-%cf%84%cf%81%ce%b1%cf%85%ce%bc%ce%b1%cf%84%ce%af%ce%b5%cf%82-%cf%83%ce%b5/) were injured but luckily nobody was killed\.

Also troubling are reports of vigilante violence coming out of Lesvos\. A local farmer [allegedly held two families](https://twitter.com/maledictus/status/1306254290521030656?fbclid=IwAR2NOufuWEx18cmk1cHKKELAB7HyW9csC4iFQNi6UXEsWs4DV5gywVhc_wM) at gunpoint\. These incidents will only become more common thanks to the attitude in much of the media, which portrays this as “normal self defense,” and violent rhetoric from government officials, including one governor who called upon the people of Lesvos to be “vigilant\.”

Donaldson’s “Displaced” newsletter\.

#### SEA
### NGOs continue saving lives and the face of Europe

[Two pregnant women](https://tg24.sky.it/palermo/2020/09/16/migranti-donne-incinte-evacuate?fbclid=IwAR1KglYSk_S1_WVVzxMozx_4vt-rrOw6KG-b1m2I8ZX2e17RnicvG465-ls) from the Open Arms ship were evacuated for health reasons\. Ten people tried to jump overboard, but they were returned to the Open Arms, which is currently sheltering 275 people\. The ship is headed for Palermo, and hopefully it will be granted a safe haven there\.

As a reminder that the work these NGOs do is incredibly vital, Sea\-Watch released its [Airborne Monthly Factsheet\.](https://sea-watch.org/airborne-monthly-factsheet-august-2020/) During the month of August they spotted over 700 people in distress, many of whom might have been ignored had it not been for the Moonbird\.

SOS Mediterranee also [published a letter](https://sosmediterranee.com/eyes-on-the-central-med-when-people-are-in-need-of-help-we-will-step-in-we-have-always-done-that/?fbclid=IwAR0XpyzVnXerhh6VUXj1iPE6uCXJJ5eskfwTMDglbV_opxMKrYycDtrVECM) summarizing the past two weeks in the Central Mediterranean\. “When people are in need of help, we will step in\. We have always done that,” they said\.
#### SERBIA

Last night, Romanian police brutally beat people on the move from Palestine with batons and fists while they were lying on the ground\. Then, they pushed them back illegally to Serbia\.

#### BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA

Many reports of physical injuries obtained by the police, both the border guards, but also forces across Bosnia and Herzegovina continue\. 
The situation in the Una\-Sana canton is becoming unbearable and the needs are only growing for a wholesome and sustainable solution so as to prevent a disaster in the making\.

Locals report that [at least six families](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10222351757284671&id=1289470514) , including about a dozen children under 10 and one pregnant woman, are stuck in no\-man’s land in Bosanska Otoka\. Police on either side are not letting them go to Sarajevo or Bihac, and they have no access to food or water\.

In Cazin, the [dead body of one man](https://www.sarajevotimes.com/lifeless-body-of-a-migrant-found-near-the-city-of-cazin/?fbclid=IwAR0na0cK-EadBmXNxq3CiGzmDwTgDcOhV7RKltBDej4Xri3MnIJtwYPVha4) from Pakistan was found\. Authorities believe he was part of a group that tried to cross into Croatia, but have not established the cause of death yet\.
#### ITALY
### Evictions despite MSF pleas for humane housing

[The authorities evicted](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/27313/authorities-clear-out-lockdown-ghetto-in-rome?fbclid=IwAR0fAtGI1grxj81psr81OsD3BwUYJaAzzi188X7usSyl5ZJYBZ88hXL4p2g) dozens of people who were sleeping rough near Rome’s Termini station but did not give them anywhere to go\. The camp was made up of people on the move and Italians who’d lost jobs due to the pandemic, all of whom had nowhere to go\. For a month and a half, MSF has been advocating for something to be done and for housing to be found\. Instead, the authorities simply cleared the camp and destroyed people’s possessions, but did not provide housing, healthcare or an opportunity to get papers in order\. Apparently for the local prefecture, out of sight means out of mind\!
### Deportations awaiting for people off Sicily

In Sicily, [81 people](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/27280/sicily-police-carry-out-81-expulsion-orders-against-irregular-migrants?fbclid=IwAR0fAtGI1grxj81psr81OsD3BwUYJaAzzi188X7usSyl5ZJYBZ88hXL4p2g) were picked up on the quarantine ship Azzurra by authorities, who issued expulsion orders justifying that they were “economic migrants\.” They will be distributed to three centers and then deported\.

Will the people be tested before they go to the other centers since they’ve spent time on a quarantine ship with 732 passengers, or will they potentially pass on COVID\-19 to those in other facilities? Why was it a priority to remove these 81 people from the ship, but not the almost 200 people who have already tested negative and should not be quarantining with those who are potentially ill?
#### UK
### Justice on the side of the oppressed, finally in practice, too

A judge [stopped a deportation flight](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/home-office-high-court-refugees-deportation-flight-cancelled-b455779.html?fbclid=IwAR0XcgWLkz3Ayc2dHWjeaM47zuJ9FIeeHhjVWybLddGXjuikpL0oiiYOSt4) from the UK to Spain, citing fears that people would be left homeless and destitute upon their arrival in Madrid\. Two weeks ago, a group of Syrians who were deported were forced to sleep on the street because they were given no support upon their arrival in Spain\. The Home Office tried to deny responsibility, saying they were not responsible for what other European countries do to “their” asylum seekers, but the law is clearly not on their side\.
#### EU

Ursula Von der Leyen said that rescue at sea must become part of a new European migration pact, and that it must be “ [compulsory and not optional](https://www.stern.de/news/von-der-leyen--seenotrettung-muss-teil-der-eu-migrationspolitik-sein-9417540.html?fbclid=IwAR2o1uZPrWrMMwd4pJ9cLJUn_so_d43R6TqDYTnb0YTjka6_sn6h-pAU5E0) \.” She also called for the replacement of the Dublin regulation, which will be replaced with a “ [new migration governance system](https://www.barrons.com/news/eu-chief-plans-to-replace-dublin-asylum-rule-01600258212?tesla=y) \.” However, it’s unclear how the EU will enforce mandatory sea rescue when even now it took no action as the Etienne engaged in a month\-long stand\-off with Malta and cannot get some nations to commit to accepting people made homeless by the Moria fire\.

Making rescues at sea “compulsory” will do nothing to save the fact that European border policy is founded on brutality and racism\. The EU’s policy of “deterrence” [relies on brutal treatment](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2020/09/16/mori-s16.html?fbclid=IwAR1d4EZeWHEQfnYHZMlPv4DUN4ATszP6_eUC0T8WHdPJnY4jcIWKOvrr9Qc) of people on the move to discourage other people from attempting the crossing, even though there is no proof that it actually works as a deterrent\. As [this excellent article](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/16/brutality-migrants-eu-lawless-borders-monitoring-body-border-control-system-allegations-violence?fbclid=IwAR2t6eP4k6guO5ATrVQL5EgHs9o-jPPsKRsMxo_ORY9os63_rc7--J4djn8) by Apostolis Fotiadis in _The Guardian_ shows, brutality has become normalized on all of the EU’s external borders\. Until violent border regimes are no longer funded, lip service to the concept of rescue at sea will ultimately do nothing\.

After the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 more than 150,000 refugees fled from Hungary to Austria. The Austrian government announced that if other states don't help, then they will not...

Europe, don’t stop marching\! European Days of Action, calling upon governments to evacuate Greek camps, are continuing, from The Hague to Rome\. For more details about dates and places, [go here](https://www.facebook.com/NewsfromtheMed/posts/1037655290021400) , and for a clear statement explaining the days of action, [go here\.](https://seebruecke.org/evacuate-now-2/?fbclid=IwAR1y4uEb0Wi8E5naiJqvz435yPs4tOiB8ATT02p5z7XZ1GHhBpyCRujSQRw)

Eugenio Cusumano and Matteo Villa [published a study](https://publications.iom.int/books/migration-west-and-north-africa-and-across-mediterranean-chapter-16) on search and rescue missions in the Mediterranean for IOM’s study on “Migration in West and North Africa and Across the Mediterranean\.” The paper shows that, to the surprise of nobody with common sense, NGO search and rescue ships are NOT a significant pull factor for people deciding to cross the most dangerous border in the world\. Instead, their biggest impact is—saving lives\. The prevailing wisdom behind EU’s border policy for the past few years has been that rescue missions provide an incentive for people on the move so they must be stopped and NGO ships must be detained\. Ideally, we’d say that this paper would help change that logic behind EU border policy, but for too long the policy has been grounded in racism and fear\-mongering instead of common sense\.
#### FURTHER READING

This interview with Giorgos Tsiakalos is [an important read](https://wearesolomon.com/mag/q-and-a/giorgos-tsiakalos-in-europe-a-racist-policy-is-being-implemented/?fbclid=IwAR2F9PvBASwJv2i8WfOJrRkGxwifSl4P52rWmLu0lytdeSVk5-gF6hCqY8I) on EU migration policy and racism\. Tsiakalos discusses everything from how the Greek government is inciting vigilante violence to how EU\-wide asylum policy towards people on the move are not shaped by actually evaluating their cases, but by geopolitical concerns and by racism\. It is a vital interview and highly recommended reading\.

Violence against people on the move is not confined to Europe’s borders, unfortunately\. [This video](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-middle-east-54150076) from the BBC discusses organ traffickers who take advantage of people trying to get to Europe from Egypt\. [This article](https://eritreahub.org/about-16000-migrants-being-held-in-just-one-saudi-centre-ethiopian-official-reveals?fbclid=IwAR3RQb_HyB8DSBwfDzPe-5aNwjsY0eowngQH7CNCKwU2rurvZLiLEEeMlsU) talks about the situation of thousands of Africans, mostly Ethiopians, held in inhumane prisons in Saudi Arabia\.

To end the digest on a positive note, here is [an article](https://www.helsingborgshem.se/sok-ledigt/vilket-boende-passar-dig/sallbo?fbclid=IwAR2ISNS7_ltBWLogvSo0NaHM4qSM9zx6bkc2MBhILZ8utF_ZJ2wK7IC5SBw) about a scheme in Sweden to help people on the move find community, and combat loneliness among elderly Swedes, by bringing the two together\.
