#### FEATURE: influx of arrivals from Turkey to Greece

Two boats were reportedly stopped by the Turkish Coast Guard on their way to Greece over Thursday night and the following morning\. In addition to the initial 400 people who arrived over Monday and Tuesday, however, more people have arrived on the Greek Aegean islands over the past 24 hours\.

15 people arrived on a boat on the south coast of Lesvos earlier on Thursday\. 
A boat with 38 people \(28 men, six women, and four children\) landed on Chios and 44 others \(12 men, 16 women, and 16 children\) were on board a vessel that arrived on Samos\.


Considering that larger numbers of arrivals appeared about 24 hours after a Greek asylum committee granted asylum to one of the eight Turkish soldiers who fled to Greece after the failed coup attempt in Turkey in July 2016, [some](http://greece.greekreporter.com/2018/01/03/rise-in-migrant-flow-likely-retaliation-of-turkish-president-over-asylum-seeking-soldiers/) interpret this recent surge as an act of retaliation by the Turkish president for asylum being granted to the soldier\.

Turkish sources, however, claim that in 2017, the country stopped 50,000 people heading to the EU from illegally leaving Turkey, and, that “despite the international agreements, Greek security forces pushed back 6,000 refugees who entered to Greece via illegal means over the Evros River\. Most of those forced back from Greece claimed that they were either beaten by Greek police or had their phone and money appropriated\.

Either way, in spite of the EU\-Turkey deal which was supposed to serve the politicians as a means to stop the influx of refugees from Turkey to Greece and the rest of Europe, the numbers have only shrunk, while the flow of people has failed to cease\.

Refugees continue to suffer in difficult circumstances all along their travels and upon their arrival to the islands, as conditions remain precarious for those who make it there\.

### Inhumane and illegal detention case linked to the EU\-Turkey deal

The latest press release of Lesvos solidarity was signed by a number of organizations active with refugees in Greece and calls for the “immediate release of a vulnerable case currently unnecessarily detained in PROKEKA, the prison within Moria refugee camp\.” They stress out that his case is one of many inhumane and illegal detention cases linked to the EU\-Turkey deal\. We wrote about it in yesterday’s Digest and you can read the entire text [here\.](https://enoughisenough14.org/2018/01/04/lesvos-inhumane-and-illegal-detention-case-linked-to-eu-turkey-deal/)

This week we will be discussing detention in Greece\. Conditions in detention centres in Greece have been heavily criticised as dangerous, cramped, cold, with terrible food, and people have spoken of violence\. Being held in detention is a very scary and horrible experience, especially when you have not committed a crime, other than being in Greece, or trying to travel without the correct papers\. The video above explains how immigration detention in Greece may affect you and what you can do if you are detained\.

### Athens

The Orange House is currently providing 480 showers a month to residents of Athens who do not have access to decent washing facilities\.


> Clean soapy water helps us to feel human in inhumane conditions\. A clean towel, shower gel and shampoo also help\! Thank you to everybody who has donated, no matter how small the amount — you help us to pay the water bills at the Orange House\.

#### SERBIA

An [update](https://www.slobodnaevropa.org/a/28955305.html) on the situation among the locals of Bački Vinogradi, a small town in the Vojvodina region of Serbia that borders with Hungary, comes from the local mayor\. After the media having written about hostility from the locals towards the refugees who have settled some 15 km in the area of Horgos, the mayor reportedly wanted to state clearly that no violence was perpetrated against the people from the side of the locals, claiming they had only expressed unease with the fact that the refugees were using their electricity and water\.

#### CROATIA

Around 450 residents of the reception centre Porin in Zagreb have, since December 1st, been receiving only canned food for supper\. Porin residents also told AYS volunteers that they don’t get fruits anymore\.

Considering that they can’t cook in their own rooms because authorities prohibit the use electrical devices, for many, especially families with children, this measure drastically reduced their quality of life\. The electric power installations in the facility are in very poor shape due to the fact that it has never been renovated, hence the restriction in using own devices\. Together with the residents of Porin, AYS awaits for the renovations to start and hopes that the new facilities will include a space where people can prepare their own food and cook\.
#### ITALY
### Police check ups, detention, and deportation

On Wednesday, another round up on an ethnic basis was done in Ventimiglia, Italian volunteers report\. Reportedly, after the usual cleaning of the river banks done by migrants and volunteers, in front of [Eufemia\-Info&Legal Point](https://www.facebook.com/EufemiaVentimiglia/) the Italian police stopped some of the boys going to Taranto\. One of them, despite the fact that he had all the documents, was detained “for an investigation\.” The growing concern is that he might have also been deported, because other people with documents have previously been deported to the south of Italy\.


> The practice of imprisonments in the border town is not a new one, but we would like to highlight and report the developments in that it has been for a long time that these people are also taking part in the — in the area in front and in the nearby bar — which is seriously undermining the Work And Developing International Support Networks \(there are lots of aid and donations coming from France and Spain\! \)

“We express our full closeness to the migrants affected by this infamous ‘gioco dell’oca,’ certain to find them in a few days in the city,” the group said\.

The City brought the case to the attention of the prosecution and judicial authorities after the minor was found on the bed in his room\.

The dead is a young Moroccan who had been welcomed in the care centre after catching a fever in the county hospital, where his foot had to be amputated due to the wounds he endured at the end of November after attempting to travel to the peninsula\.
