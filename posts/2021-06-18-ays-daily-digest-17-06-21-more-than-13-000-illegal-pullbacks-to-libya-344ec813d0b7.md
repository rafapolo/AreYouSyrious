### Lebanon

Lebanese banks have burned at least 250 million dollars in UN humanitarian aid, which was intended to support people on the run and poor communities\. According to Thomson Reuters Foundation, they lost the money by “selling the local currency at highly unfavorable rates”, Al Arabiya [reports](https://english.alarabiya.net/business/economy/2021/06/17/Lebanese-banks-swallow-at-least-250m-in-UN-aid-for-refugees?fbclid=IwAR05zTAat1JLFaxkdfGRbolYv7BIPZhDMDVD9B3dt4mLf1X0n0qjY1ucyFM) \. Due to the economic crisis and inflation, the value of the aid has shrunk despite the amount per person increasing , making it hard for people to get basic supplies like food\.
### Greece

“Despite mounting national and international pressure, Greece is still continuing, business as usual, with pushbacks and the EU stands idly by”, Raphael Shilhav, Oxfam’s EU migration expert [said](https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/alleged-pushbacks-greek-border-are-persistent-and-systematic?fbclid=IwAR2Y9QZho2CO0HtaxyqcrWkBZxXi5hvdXcDxvgXjY-IzYxasikQdMDBcQQc) in an analysis of the NGO, collecting several testimonies of unlawful behavior by Greek authorities\.
