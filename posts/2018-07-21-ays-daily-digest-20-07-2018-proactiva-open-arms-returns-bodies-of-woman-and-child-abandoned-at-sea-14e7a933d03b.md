### Feature:

**While UNHCR commends EU states France, Germany, Italy, Malta, Spain and Portugal for finally coming reaching an agreement to share the processing of 450 refugees that have been stranded on the Mediterranean, Proactiva Open Arms prepares to disembark the single survivor and corpses of the deceased women and child that were abandoned at sea by the Libyan Coast Guard earlier this week\.**

The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi stated:


> “We hope the arrangements will now be quickly and effectively implemented\. As well as ending an ordeal for these individuals, this sets a positive example of how, by working together, countries can uphold sea rescue and manage borders while simultaneously meeting international asylum obligations\.” 





Meanwhile, with ports closed and ever increasing criminalisation and restrictions on SAR vessels from rescuing boats in distress, grave concerns exist for increased reliance on the Libyan Coast Guard for future rescue operations\.

Only a few days ago Proactiva Open Arms accused the Libyan Coastguard for abandoning 3 persons after an interception fo a boat heading to Europe\. A woman and a child were killed in the incident, while a man Josefa, 40 years old from Cameron was saved after being held for 48 hours among the remains of a raft\. It is reported that he will attempt to denounce the Governments of Italy and Libya for the tragedy\.

[The Proactiva Open Arms Rescue Vessel is scheduled to arrive in Mallorca tomorrow](http://www.ansamed.info/ansamed/it/notizie/rubriche/cronaca/2018/07/20/migranti-open-arms-chiede-intervento-procura-di-maiorca_11704adf-1a1f-493a-9280-de27a4d71bef.html) \.

The Founder of Proactiva Open Arms, Oscar Camps, reports:


> “It was not an easy debreafing for mission 47\. After all the hard work and effort, we have to deal with false accusations while transporting a survivor and two corpses\.”

### Libya:
#### The Libyan Government strongly opposes the proposal to accomodate rejected asylum seekers in Libya

[According to Libyan Prime Minister Fayes Al\-Sarraj](http://news.trust.org/item/20180720084546-a1scb/) , Libya absolutely opposes the European Unions plan to establish migrant centres in the country\. He has furthermore stated that the decision will not be swayed by financial inducements\. This plan was proposed last month by Italy\.
### Sea:
#### The Italian Coast Guard expresses unease at the Governments closure of ports to those rescued at sea\.

The decision which became enforced in June to [close Italy’s ports to migrants](http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/italian-coastguards-express-unease-as-government-closes-ports-to-migrants-134784) rescued at sea is causing discomfort within the Italian Coast Guard\. Members of the coastguard have begun to speak out against the new policy, which has forced them to transfer all calls for help and reports of boats in distress to the Libyan Coast Guard\. Before this new policy the Italian coastguard played an important role in rescue missions\.

Giovanni Pettorino, the Commander of the Coast Guard has released two important statements:


> “ There is an unwritten principle that resides in the soul of every sailor: that of heping anyone who risks losing their life at sea\.” 





> “We are Italian sailors, we have 2,000 years of civility behind us”

Italy, France and Malta have refused to accept the boat to disembark\. It is fast running out of supplies\.

#### SOS Mediterranee is preparing for new Mission and Changed Conditions in the Mediterranean

The Aquarius SAR Vessel is set to [leave at the end of July from Marseilles](http://www.ansamed.info/ansamed/it/notizie/stati/francia/2018/07/19/migranti-volontario-aquarius-avremo-drone-per-le-ricerche_9edd9b49-b508-45dc-b389-d52b1b457e49.html) \. More food will be stored on the ship due to longer periods at sea\. Another addition will be the use of a drone to help locate boats in distress\.

The organisation has stated that the “The context in the Mediterranean has completely changed\.”

On June 9 Italy enforced a policy which saw it close its ports to persons rescued at sea\.

Rescue ships are no longer informed about the relief efforts in progress and we do not know why, the result is that the NGOs at sea can make sightings only for ten miles around the ship\.”

### General:
#### SITUATION IN NUMBERS

**50,800** 
\# of arrivals in Europe through Italy, Greece, Spain and Bulgaria between January and June 2018
\(UNHCR, 10 July 2018\)

**11,200** 
Estimated \# of children among all arrivals in 2018
\(UNHCR, 10 July 2018\)

**56,200** 
\# of child asylum\-seekers in Europe between January and June 2018
\(Eurostat, 7 July 2018\)

**24,500** 
\# of estimated stranded children in Greece, Bulgaria, and Serbia in 2018
\(UNICEF, 30 June 2018\)

Close to half of all child arrivals \(5,001\) were registered in Greece, where the proportion of children remains significantly higher than on other migration routes \(37 per cent compared to 17 and 16 per cent in Italy and Spain respectively\) \. Most children arriving in Greece come from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, and are typically below 12 years old, with infants and small children \(0 to 4 years old\) making the largest age group\. In Italy 2,600 unaccompanied adolescent children arrived by June 2018, adding to over 13,000 unaccompanied and separated children \(UASC\) in the Italian reception system\. Based on Eurostat figures, more than 31,000 UASC claimed asylum in Europe in 2017\.
### EU:
#### European Commission to refer Hungary to the Court of Justice for non\-compliance with EU law over Asylum procedures

On Thursday the EC decided “to refer Hungary to the Court of Justice of the European Union \(CJEU\) for non\-compliance of its asylum and return legislation with EU law\.” Hungary has had the EC:s eyes on them since 2015 when an infringement procedure was started with concerns of the country’s asylum laws, and in December 2017 the EC sent a reasoned opinion as nothing had changed in the desired direction\. Hungary was previously notified\.

The latest developments come after Hungary’s latest decision to make the tough laws tougher, as humanitarian organisations and individuals helping migrants and refugees can be seen as criminals\.
### Greece:
#### Arrivals:

According to Aegean Boat Report: Five boats have so far arrived on the Greek islands, this morning, carrying a total of 152 people\.

Breakdown:

**Two boats Lesvos, 55 people:**

> Second boat was a drop off in Tsonia, Lesvos north east, found 08\.00\.
 

> 22 people 
 

> 11 children 
 

> 6 women
 

> 5 men 





**Two boats Chios, 92 people:**


> First boat arrived in Chios port 05\.15\.
 

> Supported on arrival by SMH and CERST\.

#### Greece to change the way it handles Migration:

[The Greek Government is planning to centralise the management](http://The ministry is also to acquire a new department whose focus will be speeding up the process of transferring migrants from the Aegean islands to the mainland.) of the refugee crisis, both on an administrative and budgetary level by the ministry\.

It has been told that three new reception facilities are to be built on the mainland to allow for relocation of refugees from the overcrowded islands\.

The ministry is also said to create a new department whose focus will be on hastening the process of transfers from the islands to the mainland\.
#### English Classes for women resumed in OCC centre Polykastro


> This week we started again with English classes for women and it seems they are being a success\! Every day from 10 to 11 am in OCC Polykastro\.

#### Mobile Info Team reports of two groups of refugees forcibly returned form Greece to Turkey by Police


> Over the past 10 days, we have been in touch with two groups of refugees from Syria, Iraq and Yemen who have been forcibly returned to Turkey from Greece, by the police\. They were not given the chance to claim asylum\. 





> “I was desperate to escape the misery of war and put the Turkish camps behind me, on the 5th of July 2018 we were a group of fourteen people ready to cross the river Evros to Greece, and after 10 hours of being on the road\. It was nearly dawn but still dark when we arrived at a small Greek border village\. 





> Hungry and covered in mud, we were forced to stay at abandoned toilets to hide from the police for 5 hours before the police found us and we were taken to a different area, where we were held for more than six hours\. The police took our passports, money, phones, and shoes\. At sundown, they transported us to the small island in the river and then the Turkish police came and arrested us\. We were never given our money, passports or phones back,” our contact informed us\. 





The organisation informs the the groups are now back in Turkey\. They have reported the incidents to the UNHCR and the Greek Ombudsman and are attempting to challenge this very sad violation of peoples right to claim asylum\.
### Bosnia:

Bosnian police on Thursday discovered five people from Iraq in the city of Zvornik, near the border with Serbia\. In this small border city this year 307 people were registered\. Since February this year, thousands of people have found their way from Serbia to Bosnia, hoping to continue their travel toward the EU\.
#### Red Cross warns of deteriorating conditions in Bosnia as well as increased use of violence against persons trying to cross into Croatia and Slovenia

With over 8,000 people having arrived in Bosnia and Herzegovina since the beginning of 2018, the country is struggling to cope with the 8 times influx witnessed compared to 2017\. in the past four weeks alone 3,000 people have arrived in the country\.

In addition the organisation reports that dozens of people are being treated each day from injuries sustained while attempting to cross in to Croatia and Slovenia\. Police are increasingly using violence to protect borders and halt migration\. In Bihac, medical teams are treating anywhere up to 70 people per day\.


> IFRC spokesperson in Bihac, Nicole Robicheau, said: _“The conditions close to the border are grossly inadequate and we’re concerned for people’s safety\. Families are sleeping on the ground without any proper shelter, without bedding or blankets — people don’t want to stay here but they are effectively stranded\. Each day, people try to move onwards to Croatia but many return with injuries\.”_ 





> _“We are extremely concerned about reports of violence against people trying to make their way into Croatia,”_ said IFRC’s Regional Director for Europe, Simon Missiri\. _“Governments have the right to set and enforce migration policies, but they also have the obligation to ensure that all people, regardless of immigration status, are treated with dignity and respect\._ 




### Serbia:
#### UNHCR reports that in the last two weeks 3357 people have arrived in Serbia
