### Feature: The Final Resolution of the First European Refugee Parliament Discussion\. It Is Important\!

On 17–18 October 2018, one hundred refugees working for organisations across Europe participated for the first time in a European parliamentary session, where their voices could, at last, be prioritised\.

The Refugee and Migrant Parliaments’ aim was to bring together the opinions and ideas of people who have personally faced the consequences of EU border and migration policies\. Although this is a big step in the right direction, why has it taken so long?

The event was hosted by German MEP Cornelia Ernst who commented:


> By hosting this event, we are providing a forum for refugees and migrants to express their demands at a European level, and to put their voices at the centre of the political debate\. We must stop talking about these people, finally let them speak for themselves, and listen to them\. 





The parliament session released a final resolution and it’s important that we listen to what it says\. **Refugee advocates too, because sometimes it easy to forget is not necessary to speak on behalf for someone who has a voice of their own\.**

**The resolution, reviewed and finalized by the RISE members:**


> We are self\-organized migrants and refugees\. 





> We are a diverse group who decided to work together to face the grave situation we are all experiencing: 





> The increased aggression of right\-wing actors; increasing violence against migrants and racism at the individual and institutional levels; death and human rights abuses at the borders of Europe and within Europe\. 





> We are committed to raising our voices, to being the protagonists in our own lives\. 




#### It is important for refugee advocates to prioritise the self\-determination of refugees in Europe

The Resolution highlights a vast array of important issues that are often overlooked in discussions by Institutions and EU Member States\.

Discussion points and demands are being raised concerning: forced deportations, equal rights and access to the labor market, prevention of danger to women, rights to be upheld for LGBT asylum seekers, the externalization and militarization of borders, European arms sales to underdeveloped countries, access to health services and housing and, importantly, PARTICIPATION\!

The Resolution demands that Europe establish the Refugees and Migrants Parliament and finance it\.


> No policy about us without us\. WE demand to be included in policy\-making when it concerns our lives — RISE\. 



#### LIBYA
#### The GNA calls for the lifting of the arms embargo

They contend that the embargo should be lifted as it is necessary for counter\-terrorism defences and migration defences\.

#### TURKEY
#### Interior Ministry report debunks far\-right propaganda that Syrian refugees are criminals

[Figures in the report](http://harekact.bordermonitoring.eu/2018/10/24/report-on-refugee-crimes-debunks-far-right-perception-of-syrians/?fbclid=IwAR3HmtpuFF9Q96-G6lZ3qfe0ApDZbY-390s-D-EI2fX_L-30e4n-RpbpVOE) show that the crime rate amongst Syrians in Turkey was only 1\.46 percent in 2018\. This dropped even further compared to 2017 when the crime rate amongst Syrian refugees was 1\.53 percent\.

Despite the low levels of crime, Turkey is home to 3\.5 million refugees\. The living conditions for the majority remain deplorable and without access to the most basic services\.


> Migration Directorate officials say facts about refugees are distorted and misinformation is prevalent about them\. Indeed, social media are awash with claims that Syrians “receive salaries from the state, have their phone bills paid by the state, can be admitted to universities without exams, are exempt from vehicle taxes, are eligible to vote and will be given free housing and civil servant posts\.” 





[**Mass deportation of Syrians continues in Turkey**](https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/03/22/turkey-mass-deportations-syrians)

Despite Turkey’s open\-door policy for Syrian refugees, it has recently been reported that over 200,000 have been intercepted and prevented from entering the country\. HRW reports that many of them have been sent back to war\-torn Idlib\.


> Turkish border guards have shot at asylum seekers trying to enter Turkey using smuggling routes, killing and wounding them, and have deported to Idlib newly arrived Syrians in the Turkish town of Antakya, 30 kilometers from the Syrian border\.

The two officers have been hospitalised and are now receiving treatment for the next 6 months\.

In an anonymous email by a local police officer, he denounces the government for failing to act on important issues concerning the facility\.


> “We at the Police Directorate of Lesvos, as well as the detainees here on the island, are incredibly upset about the news that two colleagues stationed at Moria’s refugee camp have contracted tuberculosis\. The conditions concerning hygiene and safety at the facility are simply unacceptable… \. We can only hope that our publishing of this email will prompt the Ministry of Citizen Protection as well as the Ministry of Health to take action immediately\.”

#### AUSTRIA
#### Austria joins US and Hungary in backing out of UN Migration Pact

This occurred amongst fears that the pact might blur the lines between legal and illegal immigration\. Austria’s right\-wing government, which argues against granting asylum to refugees coming to Europe via the Mediterranean released the statement on Wednesday\.


> “We view some points of the migration pact very critically, such as the mixing the seeking of protection with labor migration,” said Kurz, who argues that migrants rescued in the Mediterranean should not be brought straight to Europe\. 





Amnesty International criticized Austria’s stance\.


> “Instead of facing global challenges on an international level, the government is increasingly isolating Austria\. That is irresponsible” 




#### Weekly protest resumes again tomorrow in Vienna


> Thursday is another demonstration\! We are demonstrating against the government, against violence and racism\. 





> We meet at 6 pm at the Albertinaplatz \(behind the opera\) and then go to the Ballhaus square together\. There will be talk and music there\.
