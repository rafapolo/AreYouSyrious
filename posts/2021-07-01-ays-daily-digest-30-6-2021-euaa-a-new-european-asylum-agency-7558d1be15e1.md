![“Twelve evictions in two months\. The routine of exiled persons surviving in Grande Synthe should not obscure the violence of these acts: it is part of this violence\. Law enforcement by dozens, heavy weapons, entrapment techniques and the theft of people’s property: the arguments for sheltering operations no longer stand in the face of disproportionate harassment and dehumanising actions\. Every day on the ground, our volunteers witness your strategies, that climate of terror and tension you try at all costs to put in place\. This is a failure both of strategy and for human rights and the dignity of our society\.” \(Utopia 56 Grande Synthe\)](assets/7558d1be15e1/1*zSEVdu20dGOfQ_CnVwZPdA.jpeg)

#### Featured — EUAA, a new European agency for asylum

On 30 June, the European Parliament and the Council of Europe [have reached](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_3241) an agreement to transform EASO \(European Asylum Support Office\) into EUAA \(European Union Agency of Asylum\), fundamentally creating a new expanded agency, with more funding and more staff, that “will help make asylum procedures in Member States of higher quality, more uniform and faster\. Its new reserve of 500 experts will also provide more effective support to national asylum systems facing a high caseload, making the overall EU migration management system more efficient and sustainable\.”

The agreement comes just after EASO released a report in which it revealed data from 2020\. The number of asylum applications [dropped](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/33287/eu-to-establish-new-asylum-agency) to its lowest level since 2013\. “485,000 asylum applications were made in 2020 in the 27 EU member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, signalling a 32% decrease in the number of applications from 2019\.” The drop was caused by enhanced ‘border security’ operations \(read: pushbacks\) and by restrictions on movement under the pandemic framework\.

ALGERIA
#### Hirak activists among people intercepted and returned at sea

Media [report](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/33298/algerian-opposition-figure-among-migrants-intercepted-en-route-to-spain) that 14 people were intercepted by Algerian authorities after having left the country by sea, heading for Spain\. Among them was a prominent figure in Hirak, the Algerian pro\-democracy movement—Chems Eddine Laalami\. Laalami became prominent during the 2019 protests, also known as the Hirak Movement, against the attempt of then\-president Boutefika to run for a fifth\-term in office\. He was jailed and later pardoned in February 2021 by the new president, Tebboune\. However, the new government also banned all protests by the Hirak Movement and “ [stepped up](https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/06/25/joint-letter-algerian-authorities-alarming-crackdown-pro-democracy-forces-during) legal proceedings against various opponents of the government, including political activists, journalists and academics\.” Many fear that the overall human rights situation in the country might deteriorate considerably\.

Some 300 people are currently reported to be behind bars on charges related to the Hirak protest movement, according to the [CNLD prisoners’ right groups](https://www.facebook.com/comitenationalpourlaliberationdesdetenusCNLD/) \.

SEA
#### At least seven people drowned and 10 are missing after shipwreck off Lampedusa

Media [report](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/33291/seven-migrants-drown-as-boat-capsizes-off-italy-s-lampedusa-island) that on Wednesday morning a boat capsized nine km south of Lampedusa\. When Italian Coast Guard arrived, they rescued 46 people, but were too late for seven others, whose bodies were discovered\. At least 10 more people who are still missing\.
#### Dangerous interception attempted by LCG in Maltese waters

In those same hours on Wednesday, SeaWatch’s Sea Bird [spotted](https://twitter.com/seawatch_intl/status/1410271976216748035) a Libyan vessel in Maltese waters, attempting to intercept a boat carrying 45 people with dangerous manoeuvres\. Shots were fired into the water\. This brutality endangers people’s lives\. Luckily, they managed to [escape](https://twitter.com/seawatch_intl/status/1410333398812565508) and were headed in the direction of Lampedusa\.
#### Five\-year\-old dies after 17 days at sea

A five\-year\-old girl died during a helicopter evacuation to the Canary islands\. She had been travelling on a small boat for 17 days, media [report](https://www.efe.com/efe/espana/sociedad/muere-una-nina-de-5-anos-cuando-era-evacuada-patera-tras-17-dias-en-el-mar/10004-4574792) \.

SPAIN
#### Worsening situation for young adults in Melilla

After the closure of the shelter at the Plaza de Toros last week, the situation in the enclave of Melilla has grown worse, with hundreds of people forced to sleep on the streets\. Unlike other parts of Spain, guardianship in Melilla ends when people reach the age of 18 \(in mainland Spain this has been extended to 21\) \. As [reported](https://twitter.com/SolidaryW/status/1410228243698008075) by Solidary Wheels, young adults are forced out of minors’ shelters \(often by police actions\) and left to fend for themselves on the streets of the North African town\.

#### “Work for free or leave the camp”

No Name Kitchen [report](https://www.facebook.com/NoNameKitchenBelgrade/posts/1267570420307906) an increase in people sleeping rough in the Šid area, in forests or abandoned and dangerous buildings\.


> “As different people on the move told us, the Principovac Camp, close to the border with Croatia, is going to be repaired in this period so the authorities have started to expel people from the camp\. 






> The choice that people from the camp were given, as they told us, was either to stay and work for free on the reconstruction, move to the already overcrowded Adasevci camp, or stay outside on the streets and in the forests\. 





> The people pushed to the streets have had their camp documents taken\. 





> Some men of Algerian and Moroccan origin have told us that at Adasevci camp they never had the opportunity to enter because of their nationality\. According to them, the authorities told them that just Afghan and Pakistani people are accepted there\.
