**TURKEY**

Erdogan, the Turkish president, announced plans on Tuesday to return one million Syrian refugees to northern Syria\.

The government, with the support of local and international NGOs, aim to build 100,000 houses in parts of the Turkish\-controlled Syria\. These houses will accommodate those fleeing Al\-Assad’s regime\.

**GREECE**

[The Greek Refugee Council, Oxfam, and Save the Children](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/40279/ngos-highlight-a-twotier-system-for-refugees-in-greece?fbclid=IwAR0ImsTWbkMZ5mnfpZIaCENBHOICQ8Wi2tcReQhhap9Rp_WwZgALlzfcn-I) are criticising the Greek government for the disparity in response to Ukrainian refugees versus other asylum seekers\.

As of 19 April, 21,028 people fleeing Ukraine have arrived in Greece\. Ukrainian refugees have access to the labour market and healthcare, and will soon have accommodation and food supply as necessary items\. Ukrainian children are further enrolled immediately in school, and the Ministry of Education has recently announced they will provide language classes to support children through the integration process\.

In contrast, the Greek government over the years has established a harsh policy of deterrence towards asylum seekers from other countries\. It is well reported that the government has taken part in and encouraged push backs on the Aegean Sea, and in addition, for those who do reach the reception centres, suffer from a lack of basic healthcare, nutrition, and water\. There have been a multitude of reports highlighting the overcrowded conditions in camps, combined with mistreatment, isolation, and detainment\.

There have even been reports of refugees being moved to make space and to prioritise Ukrainian refugees, for instance Afghan refugees in Serres camp were:


> “being forced to leave their containers and move to a dilapidated part of the camp, to make space for newly arrived refugees from Ukraine\.” 




On a more positive note, Greece has made an effort to provide learning facilities for refugee children, and as a result, between 2021 and 2022, over 90% of refugee children were enrolled in school\.

**FRONTEX**

**Despite the resignation of Fabrice Leggeri, [many are skeptical that FRONTEX will change for the better](https://euobserver.com/migration/154843?fbclid=IwAR1BiwTijnW-Xm8k4BpPqCbUIs8uUOmsIl8Cie0lRb4ZRtOMs7jBDIZFzS4) \. Hanne Beirens, director of the Migration Policy Institute Europe, stated:**


> “The political landscape will not make it easy for that person \[a new Frontex director\] to navigate because of this drastic shift towards a kind of almost normalisation of pushbacks,” 




Pushbacks and the lack of respect towards human rights are part of the landscape of EU migration policy\. This article argues European states need to drastically change their approach to immigration and human rights in order for there to be any effective change\.

[**Pro Asyl has published a study on the implementation of an independent human rights monitoring mechanism at the external borders of the EU**](https://www.proasyl.de/material/feasibility-study-independent-human-rights-monitoring-mechanism-at-the-external-borders-of-the-eu/?fbclid=IwAR3mceb_tc-zOYBAojjXRbAPGWdQ0C-x6UpL_oGfY_KB5C7YVn3qOidkmP0) **\.**

The EU has funded a significant sum towards to the development of stricter and more robust EU borders\. This has led to FRONTEX having greater powers and resources\. Reports and testimonies have shown that FRONTEX lacks respect towards fundamental human rights, and despite the easy access to these reports, they have often gone neglected by the relevant authorities\.


> “This has led to a perception of a lack of political oversight and judicial control of events at the European borders, which can result in impunity for committed violations, including possible criminal offenses\.” 




This study therefore delves into the importance of having a monitoring mechanism, that is independent, transparent, and has the necessary powers to act effectively, and create positive change in the treatment of refugees and asylum seekers at EU’s borders\.

**This thread by the Transnational Institute breaks down the overall EU funding that will be provided to FRONTEX between 2021 and 2027:**

His name, date of birth, and nationality were all recorded incorrectly, stating he was Nigerian\.


> “They describe him as a person who requires leave to enter or remain in the country, which he does not have\. In one document, it states that his removal from the UK was “imminent” as he had failed to give “satisfactory or reliable answers” to immigration officers\.” 




[**This article by Irtiza Majeed Sheikh explores the growing population of foreign national prisoners within the UK prison system\.**](https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/research-subject-groups/centre-criminology/centreborder-criminologies/blog/2022/05/aliens-behind?fbclid=IwAR0AvXNHGdYFRDT23hdqyKJzUUBYzPpXRtRP_Jko_sXRUjoFYZelL6JVjuY)

A foreign national prisoner, according to the UK Home Office, is;


> “someone who is not a British citizen and is convicted in the United Kingdom \(UK\) of a serious criminal offence\.” 




**Between 2010 and 2020, just under 50,000 foreign national offenders were deported from the UK\.**

Two key pieces of legislation, according to Majeed Sheikh, are the **UK Borders Act 2007** and the **Hubs and Spokes policy 2009** \. The former allows for deportation of foreign national offenders who have been sentenced to 12 months or more in prison unless evidence suggests said deportation would breach their human rights\. The latter laid the groundwork for the implementation of prisons specifically for foreign national prisoners, which are isolated from other prisons\.


![Source: University of Oxford, Faculty of Law](assets/ed9a5942b541/0*i1xjXcFLRsEPiPj6)

Majeed Sheikh questions this two\-tier criminal system and how it reflects on the British justice system\. Foreign national prisoners are evidently treated differently from other prisoners\. There is not so much of a focus on rehabilitation, but on eventual deportation to another country, a core objective of the previously mentioned legislation\.
