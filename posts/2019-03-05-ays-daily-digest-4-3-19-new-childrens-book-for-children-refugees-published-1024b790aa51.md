### Feature

Starting with some inspiration, a book is for sale that is specifically written for refugee children:


> “A fairytale that is different from the rest\. It concerns the children who are losing their homeland because of the war\. The children who are looking for a better life somewhere else\. The ‘children — refugees’” 





As anyone who has worked with children refugees can relate to, finding material designed to understand and relate to the refugee experience for children suffering through migrating and living in dehumanizing conditions is very difficult\.

The author Emilia Plati was inspired to write this book while performing story\-telling in City Plaza squat\. The book is in Greek, English, Arabic and Farsi and exhibits art from a teenager from Syria on the cover\. The teen is deaf and paints as a way to express his experiences\.

All book sales are donated to City Plaza to cover their distribution of basic needs\. Find out how to purchase or support [here](https://www.facebook.com/sol2refugeesen/posts/2041811776111155) \.

### Libya

[In an update](https://twitter.com/sallyhayd/status/1102670955334303744) on Monday concerning the urgent situation at Libya’s Triq al Sikka detention centre, where 30 refugees might be tortured as punishment for protesting, they are believed to be in underground cells\. UNHCR and human rights organizations have not gained access to the detainees\. UNHCR is calling this a “riot” rather than a protest, while refugees say otherwise\.
### Greece
