### Syria

Two women were killed and more people injured in Southern Idlib, [according](https://news.sn4hr.org/2021/06/21/two-women-killed-by-syrian-regime-forces-in-s-idlib-governorate-on-june-21/?fbclid=IwAR09gnT3Uzq_6Wl3atuMjBQAunbAHSgd7JPLWQ9d5-U-AYF3wynKImN77Po) to SNHR: The “Syrian regime artillery forces fired shells at houses located near the high\-water tank in northeast of al Bara village” in a breach of the ceasefire agreement\.
### Jordan

As the World Food Programme \(WFP\) [announced](https://reliefweb.int/report/jordan/funding-crunch-forces-wfp-scale-back-food-assistance-syrian-refugees-jordan) it will end its monthly food assistance of up to 32$ per person to some 21,000 Syrian refugees due to a shortage of funds\. “WFP urgently needs US$58 million to continue food assistance until the end of the year for the half million refugees it supports,” the statement reads\. Food insecurity among refugees in Jordan has doubled in the last year to reach 25 percent\. Two in three refugees — 64 percent — are on the edge of food insecurity, the WFP states\. 68 percent saw their incoming dropping since the beginning of the pandemic\. By struggling to cover basic needs, many are considering to return to Syria, the Middle East Eye [adds](https://www.middleeasteye.net/features/syrian-refugees-jordan-contemplate-return-home-un-cuts-aid?fbclid=IwAR3GqmdYWS8jasjZtQYIF38pvgwSk7kgwjBg_fGV-LZyrJ1BXGZRVdOJmo0) \.

### Kurdistan

Activists from Makhmour Refugee Camp accuse Twitter of censoring their posts about a bombing on the camp with “sensitive content”: “We believe that our account may be targeted in order to prevent us from sharing information, and would like Twitter to resolve this immediately\.”

Regarding the bombing, the EU Turkey Civic Commission \(EUTCC\) listed four demands to the Secretery General of the United Nations to protect the camp residents, sanction Turkey for violating international laws and committing war crimes and urge the Kurdistan Regional Government to lift the embargo on the camp\.

### Turkey

Up to an estimated two million children in Turkey are affected by child labour\. Many of them are displaced people from other countries: The Turkish Statistical Institute indicates 720,000 children\. The number could be even higher, [according](https://ahvalnews.com/syrians/lost-childhood-turkeys-refugee-children-and-child-labourers?fbclid=IwAR1GO36O3CWnSECK-KoL7VqhvI5nbqlLiKEMnK8dQy0llBft2rdW5lBiN7M) to Ahval News\. “If the Turkish state fails to provide quality education to Syrian refugee children, a lost generation may grow in the near future,” the outlet [warns](https://ahvalnews.com/syrians/lost-childhood-turkeys-refugee-children-and-child-labourers?fbclid=IwAR1GO36O3CWnSECK-KoL7VqhvI5nbqlLiKEMnK8dQy0llBft2rdW5lBiN7M) \.

In 2019, only 65,000 Syrians in Turkey had work permits, while some 6 million people of various nationalities live in the country to seek international protection — most of them Syrians\. “Migrant female workers are frequently harassed in their workplaces, but they cannot even complain for fear of legal sanction or deportation,” highlighted at a conference, Gazeteduvar [reports](https://www.gazeteduvar.com.tr/disk-multeci-iscilerle-birlikte-mucadele-etmeliyiz-haber-1526187?fbclid=IwAR0vX5g22KaOK-9i_i-cZjbdfTmncxAuv9wYl86owvm0oa7_lLkxtAsSMow) \. At the meeting, refugees as part of the working class and their struggles were discussed\.
### Israel

Israel is still struggling to speed reviews of asylum applications, Haaretz [reveals](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-israel-was-asked-to-reexamine-3-000-asylum-requests-this-year-it-granted-one-1.9925832?fbclid=IwAR1YjK0S1ACk-bQAw9hD9Ut7waKeQWxA_gkFFWUeCTBEDA80Rl8kQW-Je6w) \. Although chairpersons have been added to the committee, it still takes an average of 1\.5 years\. In the last six months, they approved one case, while 3000 asylum requests have been submitted\. In overall, it needs to reexamine 13,000 cases\. 3000, which have been denied and 10,000 which have not been reviewed after new criteria were passed\.
### Libya

Teenage girls have [told](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/33093/libya-teenage-girls-sexually-abused-in-shara-al-zawiya-detention-center?fbclid=IwAR2y16q7qFmoulox0E0Y9z9uOQBu6tKKVCud6LuGLMwvjSGd4zz9m3SiSFU) the Associated Press, that they experienced sexual abuse by guards in the government\-run detention center Shara al\-Zawiya\. “You have to offer something in return to go to the bathroom, to call family or to avoid beating,” one girl said\. “It’s like we are being held by traffickers\.” The camp is part of a network, which is funded by the EU\.
### Sea

45 people were rescued on Sunday and brought to the Canary Islands\. They were in relatively good health, InfoMigrants writes referreing to the Spanish online news portal _Aragón Noticias_ with news agencies, seven were transferred to a clinic\. This year, some 5700 people disembarked on the island\. Off Fuentaventrua 52 people were [rescued](https://www.canarias7.es/canarias/fuerteventura/rescatan-personas-patera-20210621184320-nt.html?fbclid=IwAR3v6TIWxJeQ2aFhHhInhj1QHQPtCdX0383n1jb92VHcjekbji5Zy3yzvLc&ref=https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2F) \.

Alarmphone fears, that after a shipwreck off Libya some 18 people could be dead\. 31 were rescued and more seem to be missing\.

We learned via several sources of a shipwreck yesterday off #Libya. 18 Syrian nationals are believed to have died. While it seems that 31 people were rescued, many appear missing. They had fled from places such as Syria, Palestine, Somalia and Yemen.

93 people arrived in Lampedusa hotspot, which hosts now some 300 people, [according](https://www.adnkronos.com/migranti-nuovo-sbarco-a-lampedusa_2CnxT5ivKwXGJdhCnkbM2B?fbclid=IwAR2VNrcLSXYnMkfQsr5F6YgdPcqZHywRypxH67PfQmMIKq7ghWbDfrsvD88?refresh_ce) to adn kronos\. 14 people have landed in Italy near Lecce, Lecce Prima [writes](https://www.lecceprima.it/cronaca/sbarco-quattordici-migranti-castro-21-giugno-2021.html?fbclid=IwAR13CpKZUyb_DZUVRy_bk46TWEVIuCneLuq5fTscUBy-Uq-GCc2lBtxkLAY) \.
### Greece

In Greek camps, more than 1300 residents recieve treatment by MSF because of mental problems, der SPIEGEL [documents](https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/griechisches-fluechtlingslager-ritsona-diese-mauern-machen-uns-einsam-a-6743529a-6189-45ab-9315-f9fd2bcb8565?fbclid=IwAR1vuAVawYSRM8XnWBD-C4WtJt9X2fMsaKIAhShfK4h7iKxtcAcUlW1SbBY) \. Every third client is a child\. One doctor told the magazine, that even a six\-year old had suicidal thoughts\.

This Tuesday, the trial against the Vial 15 will be held in Mytiline, Lesbos\. “The arrestes were based on the testimony of a police officer who allegedly recognised them by details such as “height” and “hair colour”, and because they were carrying lighters and knives — everyday items in a camp used for cooking and smoking,” Borderline Europe explains, fearing there will not be a fair trial\.

Amid the terrible hygienic conditions, Covid-19 added to the fear and tension in the camp. https://t.co/UJwYhMeLBL

### Italy

Italian authorities arrested seven people, who are accused of having forced migrants to work for a few euros per hour, InfoMigrants [reports](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/33072/italy-seven-people-arrested-in-anti-gangmaster-operation?fbclid=IwAR1hm2wIG6p9pwYgmYWV4cFoOokevLpDxiD4cBoKVZjWN022mmNarqx12P4) \. This comes along with a new [report](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/33078/new-report-denounces-labor-conditions-for-agricultural-migrant-workers-in-italy?fbclid=IwAR0iFkdJ6P3GXK5SivV9NkengykMYTQWvJQ3iRILtJkdlKv8v8qbmlAHnBg) by Doctors for Human Rights \(MEDU\), that working conditions for migrants on the Gioia Tauro plain in southern Calabria are “desolate”\. With tent camps and a lot of waste around, no healthcare or transportation, the conditions even worsened during the pandemic\. The NGO further states, that only 56 percent of workers they assisted had a contract and only 52 percent a regular salary\.
### France

With a new tactic, it his harder for people in Calais to anticipate police raids of makeshift campts, InfoMigrants [revealed](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/33065/france-unpredictable-raids-target-migrants-in-calais?fbclid=IwAR3i0MV8n0IwWVIGDp8rPRVQZZEA7nM4eiVUU0d3lLi5ugUwN9UwHjMhYUA) \. While previously they were patrolling in a predictable 48\-hours schedule, now they clear the sites without perimeters\. NGOs in the field criticize, that this creates more psychological pressure on people\.

### UK

From March 2020 to February 2021, the Home Office has only resettled twelve vulnerable children, Byline Times [revelead](https://bylinetimes.com/2021/06/21/only-12-vulnerable-children-resettled-under-asylum-scheme-in-11-months/?fbclid=IwAR1rk0q0vuxjfthBk1DJ2DArz9daUfKL0uCITsmkt-AThnyLsbS55K1tkPo) and adds, that in 2020 only 353 asylum seekers have been resettled via official programmes\.
### Germany

Even though recognized refugees have a legal right for family reunion, process is often slow in Germany\. In 2020, the number dropped to 7231 relatives, compared to 13,706 in 2019, Tagesschau [found out](https://www.tagesschau.de/investigativ/panorama/familiennachzug-235.html?fbclid=IwAR1gBHJGt3OAXKOOC87oyFcyICoXqqSkToAIATyvnoWApf-uULiY21xqDGM) \. By law, only for people with subsidiary protection, reunions of 1000 people per month are possible — but only 5200 Visa were granted\. One reason are long waiting times at the embassies\.

Seebrücke supporters demonstrated in more than 50 cities to evacuate the camps at the EU’s external borders and welcome the people in countries and municipalities, which want to host them\. They further demanded to end Germany’s involvement in Frontex and EUNAVFORMED operations and start governmental sea rescue\.

### Denmark

Ylva Johannson, EU’s commissioner for home affairs, criticized Denmark’s approach to process asylum applications outside its own borders\. “A system aiming for external processes outside the EU instead of protecting the right to apply for asylum in the EU would send a strong and wrong signal to the outer world,” she said, [according](https://euobserver.com/migration/152193?fbclid=IwAR2l84Y9BJz8o9f5oTgGggtnetLcWlhaMJMz1_uyLx-YLAZUtz70SL91WnY) to EU Observer, indirectly targeting the country\. She further warned about a knock\-on effect on neighboring countries\.
### EU

The ombudsman of the European Union closed another two inquiries about Frontex’ transparency, StateWatch [notes](https://www.statewatch.org/news/2021/june/frontex-observatory-updates-ombudsman-closes-two-inquiries/?fbclid=IwAR3Np-TckJzhDdNR1aVkkKhsSw2BFYFQ7-sjRxLfxTfM-nFmLq2w9ncx21k) \. The recommendations now include:
- That Frontex make clear to its officers that they should accept and transmit any complaints received;
- That Frontex’s information materials specify that complainants will not be penalised;
- That Frontex consider accepting anonymous complaints; and
- That Frontex makes public all FRO annual reports, including information on actions taken by the agency upon the FRO’s recommendation\.

### Australia

A court in Australia has freed a Syrian inmate from a camp\-island in the Indian Ocean, after he lost his Visa\. His case, which took him six years, was the first one in decades to be decided positive, Politico writes\. The court also questioned the legal foundation of the offshore asylum policy, which has been often [criticized](https://www.politico.eu/article/doubts-australia-offshore-handling-refugees/?fbclid=IwAR0Q_P5b0SxUtigqXOtn2wdOO9LmDtYSLc1goFSoXW9Pu7S4MWphKvmeuG4) \. NGOs hope, that the ruling will have impact on changing it\.
