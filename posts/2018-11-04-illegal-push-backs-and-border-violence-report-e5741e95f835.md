_Number of victims_ : 3\.

Interview was conducted with all group members with the help of a translator from Arabic to English\.

_Expressed intention to seek asylum in the country_ : Yes

_Documents signed_ : No

**DESCRIPTION OF INDICENT**

Farhan, Hussein and Ahmad walked from Velika Kladuša \(Bosnia and Herzegovina\) and crossed to the Croatian territory and wanted to continue further to Europe, with the intention to reach Italy and seek asylum there\. After three days of walking, the men almost reached Slovenia\. They were walking in a forest, close to the village Stara, but were detected by the police\.

A Croatian female police officer, who caught them, asked them for their identification and questioned the men about their intentions in Slovenia\. According to Farhan, this officer treated them with respect and they did not have any problem with her\. Following the short verbal investigation by a female officer, all of them were then transported by a police car to the police station by the Bosnian border where they were handed over to the Croatian border police\.

When the men were handed to around 10 border police officers, Ahmad recalled that they started to be treated like animals\. The border police firstly frisked their bodies and then, took all their phones and money\. The men were told that once they were going to be deported, all their possessions would be returned to them, but they received back only their phones that were fully damaged\. Hussein told that one police officer, a bald man between 40–50 years with blue eyes, was particularly rude and aggressive towards them\. When the men tried to ask the police whether it was possible to apply for asylum in Croatia, this bold man shouted at them something in the Croatian language they did not understand and hit them with a baton\. According to Hussein, this man was probably the one who later during their deportation back to Bosnia was attacking them the most\.

After the body frisk, the men were then transported by a van to a forest location at the Croatian\- Bosnian border, where they were pushed back from the Croatian side to Bosnia and physically attacked:

_“They \[police\] put us into a big car and were driving us very fast, so we were falling from one side to another inside\. They \[police\] kept turning on the heater, really high, and after switched on air conditioning on very high, so we had a problem to breath and felt sick\. The car stopped in some abandoned place\. We were sitting and waiting inside of the car very long time\. I think the police was waiting till it got very dark outside, so no one could see how they were attacking us\. When it could be around 4 in the morning, they \[police\] told us to get out of the car\. It was really dark; the lights of the police car were also switched off\. We started feeling the hits by batons from all sites and could hear the scream of the police attacking us\. I think all of them, 10, were beating us and shouting at us to go back to Bosnia\. I did even not know from where the hits were coming from, we could just feel them, everywhere, on our back, legs, head, face…\. This is racism”_ \(Hussein\) \.

After the attack and push\-back to Bosnian territory, the men had several injuries, and had to walk back to the makeshift camp in Velika Kladuša, where their violent journey started\.

**INFORMATION ABOUT THE PERPETRATORS**

Ten Croatian border police officers, wearing black uniforms\. The one who was particularly rude and aggressive towards the men was a bald man between 40–50 years old, with blue eyes\.

_Details_

**DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT**

Fajsan with wife and three years old daughter, and one more family from Iraq \(father and two children\), walked from Bihac \(Bosnia and Herzegovina\) into the Croatian territory, around 5km in the inner Croatian land, from where they were picked up a car organised by a smuggler\. Fajsan told that they paid to a smuggler 1000 euros per one person to be transported from Croatia to Slovenia, where they wanted to apply for asylum\. Fajsan explained that he had been violently pushed back from Croatia several times\. He wanted to initially apply for asylum with his family, and for this reason he wanted to go to Slovenia to apply for asylum there\. Fajsan believed that without help of a smuggler, it would be impossible for his family to reach Slovenia by foot with his small daughter and wife\.

After around 10 km of driving with a smuggler inside of Croatia, their car was detected and began to be chased by five police cars who were simultaneously firing guns to make the driver stop\. When the driver \(smuggler\) stopped, around seven police officers told the families and the driver to get out off the car\. Fajsan told that the driver got arrested for an illegal transport of undocumented persons\.

Then, the officers \(all males\) told the families to lay on the ground and frisked their bodies, including women and children\.

_“They told us to lay on the ground, all of us, also my baby\. They did not speak nice to my baby\. My friend, the man from Iraq, was telling the police: “I am a Muslim, please help me\.” And the police said: “The Muslims killed my father during the war, I don’t want to help you\.” I told them that the one man who killed his was not my friend and asked them why they don’t speak good to me\. He \[police\] said to me: “Shut up” and kept speaking to me in very bad way, calling saying “pička ti materina” \(mother fucker\) … They \[police\] searched our bodies, also my wife and my daughter\. They \[police\] were touching them and kept touching them\. You know, they were touching me wife everywhere\. I said to them: “Please, brother, don’t touch my wife and daughter, please, don’t touch them”\. I kept asking them, “please, don’t touch them”\. But they told me: “Shut up\!” and kicked into my legs \[covering his eyes with hands\] \. I asked them what happened because I am not a terrorist, I am a refugee\. This is not good behaviour to us”_ \(Fajsan\) \.

Fajsan asked the police whether him and his family could apply for asylum in Croatia and access the formal accommodation asylum centre there\. The police told him, “ok, we will take you to the camp”\. But instead transporting them to a formal camp, the families were driven directly to the Bosnian border for their deportation\. According to Fajsan, they were transported to the border by a big van that was driving very fast and turning from right to left, so that everyone inside of the van was falling from one side to another\. The car stopped at the Bosnian border, in an abandoned forest location, around 20 km away from Velika Kladuša\.

At the border, the police told Fajsan and others to give them all their possessions, such as cigarettes, money, phones\. They stole Fajsan’s 200 euros and from others around 100 euros per each\. Then, the officers told the families to go back to Bosnia, pushing them and attacking them by batons:

_“By the border, after they robbed us, they pushed to my wife and shouted at her to go back to Bosnia\. They kept telling my wife bad things\. They \[police\] also pushed my friend, who is fifty years old, now he has a problem with his knee\. My friend told me: “Don’t worry, come and we will come to Croatia later”\. The police could hear it and said: “After you go to Croatia?” and took a baton and hit this man into his legs\. They were acting to us like we were terrorists\. …There was another Pakistani man who was being deported with us and I could see how the police was hitting him by a baton”_ \(Fajsan\) \.

After the attack, the families walked back to Velika Kladuša\. Fajsan told that he was very frustrated by the asylum and border system in Europe, that gives him no options to find a peaceful life for him and his family:

_“I just want to find a safe place, not too much money or big house\. I just want a peaceful life\. Look \[showing the photo of his destroyed car after an explosion by the Iranian Government\], I had problem with the Government in Iran\. I just want a safe place in Europe and peace”_ \(Fajsan\) \.

**INFORMATION ABOUT THE PERPETRATORS**

The group was being deported by twenty Croatian border officers, wearing blue uniforms\.

**INJURIES AND MEDICAL TREATMENT**

Fajsan’s friend had a pain in his knee after the attack by a baton\. Fajsan’s wife was traumatised by the sexual harassment by the male Croatian police officers, when they were frisking her body, and since then, she is concerned to move around the camp unaccompanied\.

Amin told me that they wanted to reach Italy and apply for asylum there\.

The second day of walking around 11 am, the group was caught by seven men in a civil car, who had guns and claimed to be the Croatian police although they did not wear uniforms\. Some men tried to run and hide themselves in bushes, but the “police” pulled their guns out and started shouting at everyone to come out of the bushes otherwise they were going to kill them\. Since everyone was scared, they came out of bushes\. The police men were acting aggressively towards Amin and others from his group\. Amin told that the police was pointing pistols against them and threatening them:

_“I was really scared as when the police caught us, they pointed the gun against me, and told me to not to move\. I was very scared\. They told us: “If anyone runs from here, we will shoot them”_ \(Amin\) \.

Following the frisk of the men’s bodies, this group of police men in civil clothes called other police officers some in blue uniforms and others in black clothes, who arrived at the place of their detention in a police white van\. Then, this new police group transported the men to the Bosnian border\. On the way to the border, the car stopped two time to pick up more people for their deportation back to Bosnia\. The journey to the border took around one hour and half\. Amin told that they arrived at the Bosnian border, abandoned road location, around 3 pm\. Amin asked the police whether he could apply for asylum in Croatia but got no response from hem\.

At the border, the police deported all the men, one by one, back to Bosnia and physically attacked them:

_“The police told on man to come out of the car, and they closed the door\. We could hear how they \[police\] were hitting him so much\. And after, they said other people to come out by one\. There was one wall by the road, there were standing the police men with sticks, and after there was another wall, where there were other police men also with sticks\. So, two police were hitting us before that wall and when we crossed this wall, another two police men, who had masks, were again hitting us\. We could see only their eyes\. They hit all people and after when we were walking down, they were kicking us\. And when we were walking away from Bosnia, they run and again hit us from the back to tell us to go fast”_ \(Amin\) \.

The men walked from the hill where they were pushed back by the police officers, where they found the first man from their group who was attacked\. He had few of the men’s bags, as one of the police officers gave it to him after the attack, but when they opened the bags, they were either empty or full of broken phones and cut cable chargers and empty wallets:

The police, who arrived at the place of detention, questioned Aazar and his friends about their identities and intentions in Croatia\. Aazar explained to the police that he was from Afghanistan and wanted to apply for asylum in Zagreb:

_“I told them that I wanted to stay there \[Croatia\] if they would allow me\. They just asked me from where I was, my age, what was my name, but no finger print\. If they take fingerprint no problem, I give my fingerprint to take asylum\. But they don’t give us asylum, for us\.

**Details**

_Expressed intention to seek asylum in the country:_ Yes

_Documents signed_ : No

**DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT**

Abdula, Mehdi and Anas were walking together from Velika Kladuša \(Bosnia and Herzegovina\) to Croatia, and further to Slovenia, where they wanted to apply for asylum in Ljubjana\. The fifth day, they were walking in a forest between the villages Susak and Rupa, where they were detected by two Slovenian police officers, one woman and one man, wearing police uniforms\. Mehdi told that thepolice was treating them like they were criminals, giving them orders: “Stay\! Sit\! Move\!”\.

The men told the officers that they wanted to apply for asylum in Slovenia, but the police responded to them: _“You are Muslim man, living in good country, here no asyl\. You are not Catholic, you are Muslim, go back to your country\. What are you doing here? You are not regular, this is the big problem here”_ \(Anas\) \.

Then, all of them were transported by a car to the police station in Lisac — Susak \(Slovenia\), where they were detained for one day\. At the polices station, they were provided a translator, an older man from Palestine, who refused to help them to ask for asylum procedure:

_“He \[translator\] was just sitting there and did not speak\. Just sit\. Just asked us for our names and country and where from we crossed the border and what time\. I asked him for asyl\. He told me: “Just silent”\. When I asked him to translate that I needed asylum, he told me: “No asylum here\. Not talk about this\. No asylum in Slovenia, you go back to Bosnia”_ \(Mehdi\) \.

The following day, before the men were transported to Croatia, the men were given a paper document to sing, which they did not understand because it was written in the Slovenian language\. They were told by the police to sign this paper\. Later they found out that they were made to sing the paper where was written that they had to pay a fee 200 euros each for irregular entry to Slovenia:

_“They gave me all these papers, but not in English, Arabic or French\. I did not understand\. I asked the police man: Can I ask you, can you get me this paper in Arabic? He told me: “You can’t, just sign”_ \(Mehdi\) \.

The men were then transported to a police station close to the Croatian border, where they were detained for two days\. Abdula told that they were detained in a small room, cell, which was full of people\. The police gave them only one food during the whole time of their detention\.

After two days, they were handed over to the Croatian border police, who transported them together with other 7 men to the Bosnian border for their deportation\. Mehdi and Anas told me that they were driven only for few hours to some location, where they were detained inside of the car for ten hours\. All of them had a problem to breath inside of the car because there was no ventilation, resulting in lack of oxygen\. Around 2 am, the car started moving and transported the men to an unmarked forest location at the Bosnian border where was a river, around 10 km away from Velika Kladuša \(Bosnia and Herzegovina\) \.

When the men arrived at the border, they were told to come out of the car, where police men in black uniforms and masks and equipped with batons and guns were waiting for them\. These police officers firstly broke the men’s phones and stole their money:

_“There were police men with masks\. They said to us: “Five persons come out, who can speak English?”\. Me and my friend we could speak English\. I told him, I need my phone and my money\. He gave me give plastic bag and said that this was my phone\. I opened the plastic bag and my and the others’ phones broken\. All person phone broken\. And no money\. One man had 1\.300 euros”_ \(Abdula\) \.

Then, the police physically attacked all of them by batons and kicks, shouted at them to go back to Bosnia, and started shooting around them by guns:

_“They had masks, I don’t understand\. They had guns and ta ta ta ta ta, for maybe just telling me to move\. But where I could move? There was just a forest\. They shot around me maybe twenty times\. Maybe for making me move\. But where I move? I did not see anything” \(Abdula\) \._

_“They were acting like animal\. They hit you, no respect, in the night, not able to see anything\. But I am not a criminal, not a terrorist, just an immigrant\. They twisted with my finger”_ \(Mehdi\) \.

All men then slept outside and then walked back to the camp in Velika Kladuša\. Abdula told that the men from whom the police stole 1\.300 euros was crying because he had no money left\.

He sat down on a chair and explained that he was brutally attacked by the Croatian police at the Bosnian border the previous night, when him and other 16 persons were being deported back to Bosnia:

_“They made a half circle in front of the car and one by one called out of the car and beating him\. There were children and woman\. They also beat the woman because she tried to hide her phone under her clothes and they found out, so they hit her by a baton\. Her children and we could see it\. Children were crying\. But the police did not care\. They kept telling me: “Fuck you, fuck your mother”, and after shouting at us, “Hajde, go back to Bosnia\!”\. It was horrible, they were deporting us around 3 am and for three or four hours after, we were searching for each other in a forest\. They were beating also an old man who was there with us and now has broken finger\. … Do you have a cigarette? I have money \[pulling ten marks out of his pocket\], but I cannot go to the supermarket because I feel so dizzy and tired\. I keep vomiting blood\. I can’t eat anything as I vomit it out\. I think I may have maybe internal bleeding from so many kicks into my body”_ \(Saad\) \.

Later in the afternoon, another four men who were together with Saad deported back to Bosnia, came\. Mahmoud, 35 years old Syrian who could speak fluent English, explained to me what happened to him and his friends the previous night at the Croatian\-Bosnian border\. According to Mahmoud, him and 16 people, including one family with three children, walked from Sturlic \(Bosnia and Herzegovina\) and crossed the border to Croatia, with the intention to apply for asylum in the EU\. Mahmoud explained to me that all of them have difficult situations in their homelands, escaping war and violent governments, and for this reason they have searching for safety in Europe:

_“We have very bad situation in our countries\. Especially in my case, I have my brother in a prison in Palestine because of political reasons\. My mother, they shot her on the way home in Syria\. I have no way to go, only to Europe\. His \[Khalid\] family is for three years lives in Austria\. He triesto go with them, he is 64 years old and was kidnapped in Iraq\. Abu’s family is in England, the same case\. We don’t need European money, we need European safety”_ \(Mahmoud\) \.

Mahmoud then told me that when they were walking in Croatia, a forest road around 1 am, they could hear voices of police men and could see the light of torches in the dark\. Soon after that, a police car with three officers arrived at the road where they were walking:

_“The car was driving so fast that they almost crashed the family with kids who were on the road\. We \[the men\] were hiding at first, but we came out because we did not want to causeany problems and did not want to leave the family there”_ \(Mahmoud\) \.

Few minutes later, other three police cars arrived with other ten officers who wore dark blue uniforms\. Abu remembered the registration number of one of the cars: HR \(CROATIAN FLAG\) ZG 156\. The police told all people to put their bags in front of them and remove their phones, which the officers took from them\. A woman, mother of three children, said to the police that she did not have a phone, but when the officers frisked her body, they found a phone hidden under her clothes\. Mahmoud told that when the police discovered that she hid her phone, they physically attacked her by a baton in front of her children, who were crying:

_“It was very hard for us because we saw our woman being beaten by the Croatian police and we could do nothing\. They beat her so much by baton”_ \(Mahmoud\) \.

The police did not ask the people any questions, police apparently even did not know their names, and directly drove them to the Bosnian border for their deportation\. The police told all 17 people to enter a small van, where was a lack of oxygen and people had problem to breath inside during their transportation:

_“They put us in car\. We are 17 persons with the children, they put us into very small car, van, into a boot\. They were driving very fast, like on purpose\. Salah and others started vomiting inside and children started crying\. It was really awful\. It was harder than the beating”_ \(Mahmoud\) \.

After 30 minutes of journey, the car stopped at the Bosnian border\. The police opened the van and said to all people to come out either individually or in pairs\. Then, the officers physically attacked them by batons and kicks while pushing them back to Bosnia, including Khalid, who is 64 years old:

_“They told us to go one by one or two by two, and they beat us\. When they opened the car, Salah was still vomiting, and they saw him vomiting and they started beating him\. They hit him into his arm … when they told me to come out of the car, they asked me: “Where are you from?”, and I said to them: “I am from Syria”\. He answered: “What is the matter with Syria?\!” and started beating, beating, beating and after, he told me: “Go\!”\. Ok, so when I started walking I had pass all of them, 9 police men, while they were all attacking me by batons_ ”\(Mahmoud\) \.

_“They \[the police\] threw a water on me and Salah, with bottle of the water on our heads and after, they beat us with sticks \[batons\] \. They put my shoes on my chest and head and said very hard words to me\. I fell, and they kept beating me although I was on the ground\. I was rolling, and they kept beating me”_ \(Abu\) \.

All were trying to run away while they were being beaten, but in a remote forest location in the dark night, they struggled to find the way out\. Abu told that they lost their bags when they were trying to escape\. When the police finished beating all of them and they could hear them driving away from the point of their deportation, all started searching for each other and for their bags\. Mahmoud told me that later, when they were walking from the place where they got deported, they found many broken phones and cut chargers on the way from the previous deportations of other people in the same place\. Abu also said to me that that they could hear scream of other people from far away who were also being deported and attacked by the police in the same night:

_“When we found each other, they \[police\] brought other persons to the same point and we could hear their voices\. We could hear screaming like a hell\. We were very afraid because we could hear lots of crying from far away\. The kids were very afraid\. We could hear lots of crying noises”_ \(Mahmoud\) \.

**INFORMATION ABOUT THE PERPETRATORS**

Abu remembered the registration number of the police car in which they were deported to the Bosnian border: **HR \(CROATIAN FLAG\) ZG 156** \.

The men described the police officers in the following way:

_“In total, there were 9 police officers\. There was one big, 1,95 meters or something\. One fat guy, he could be forty years old, he was the boss\. There was also a young female police officer\. They had metal sticks that they used for beating us”_

**INJURIES AND MEDICAL TREATMENT**

Khalil, a 64\-years old man, has broken finger caused by the attack, push and kicks, by the police officers\. Others have scratches and bruises around their body \(back, arms, legs\) caused by the physical attack by kicks and batons\.

After few days of walking, the police detected them and started shooting around them by pistols\. Darius told me that he could hear around six bullets\. The men stopped and all of them feared the police officers who were acting aggressively towards them since the beginning while verbally and physically attacking them\. The police questioned the men about their intentions in Croatia, but when they wanted to explain to the officers their situation, they did not let them to say anything and attacked them at every occasion the men wanted to speak out:

_“When I saw the police, they asked us what we were doing here\. I said that I wanted safe country, save my life\. And he did not listen to me, only kick\.

**DESCRIPTION OF INDICENT**

Farshid and his two friends, all from Iran, travelled by foot from Velika Kladuša \(Bosnia and Herzegovina\) to Croatia\. According to Farshid, they walked 30 km away from the Bosnian border for about 6 hours\. When they were in a forest, inside of the Croatian territory, they were detected by 6 police officers in dark blue uniforms\. Farshid could hear their shouting and shooting of their guns:

_“We were in the jungle and could hear police coming\. They shoot three four times\. When theycatch me, they broke my phone and three power banks”_ \(Farshid\) \.

The police officers questioned the men about their nationality but did not ask them any further questions identifying their intentions in Croatia\. Farshid tried to explain the police officers that he wanted to stay in Croatia and seek asylum there, but the police refused his request without any formal investigation of his case and access to the asylum procedure:

_“I said to them \[police\] that I wanted to stay here \[in Croatia\] \. They said: “No, no, no\. It does have space for you, go back\. I don’t have camp here, here, it is full, it is full,” this is what police said to me”_ \(Farshid\) \.

Following that, the men were taken to a police van and deported straight to the Bosnian border\. The journey to the border took about one hour\. Farshid told me that here were other six men from Morocco inside of the van, who had been caught by the police while crossing the Croatian land before Farshid and his friends\. The journey to the border was difficult for the men because the van did not have any windows and there was a lack of oxygen:

_“The oxygen was not good, the person from Morocco was not feeling really well\. The car wasdriving very fast”_ \(Farshid\) \.

The van stopped in a remote area close to the official border check\-point in Maljevac, where was a steep hill and a small river\. When they arrived at the Bosnian border, the police robbed the men and destroyed their possessions\. While some police officers were initiating robbery, one officer refused to participate in the humiliation of the men and decided to return them their money that others from his team wanted to steal:

_“At the border, they stole two telephones\. I had 1,500 euros\. The police wanted to Alibaba it, but one person \(police officer\) was very good and gave me the money back”_ \(Farshid\) \.

Following the robbery, the men were told to get off the car one by one\. The police officers were waiting for them outside of the car\. Once they individually exited the car, all officers \(6\) started physically attacking them by batons and shouting at them to go back to Bosnia:

_“Three times or four times, they hit me by baton, into my head and they also hit my friend\. Five or six times beat me under my back and legs\. They could not beat me in the upper part of back because I had my bag on\. And after, they pushed me into the river\. After, I run away …actually, it was hard night, hard night”_ \(Farshid\) \.

This incident was just another episode of violence in Farshid’s life\. Farshid attempted to reach asylum in the EU territory four times and it always ended by his violent deportations by the Croatian police back to Bosnia and financial exploitation by people smugglers\. Farshid told that he had previously decided to pay 2\.300 euros to a people smuggler to be transported from Bosnia to Italy, but he got caught by the police in Slovenia, from where he was deported to Croatia, followed by his violent push\-back to Bosnia\. He lost smuggler’s contact and his money\.

Akram and Samer walked from Velika Kladuša \(Bosnia\) to a remote forest in Croatia, about 10 km far away from the Bosnian border, from where they supposed to by picked up by a people smuggler\. Smuggler promised the boys to take them to Slovenia, from where they would have continued in a different car to Italy\. Samer told that there was no legal chance for them to reach asylum in Europe, and for this reason they decided to pay 2\.500 euros to a “taxi driver” who would help them\. They reached the arranged point around 6 pm, and were waiting for a taxi, but were detected by 2 police officers in dark blue uniforms\. When the police saw them, they started verbally and physically attacking them:

_“They were just saying to us: “Fuck you Muslim, fuck your brother, fuck your mother, just shouting at us and after beating us”_ \(Akram\) \.

Arkam told the police that he was 16 years old, but the officers did not pay attention to this and kept beating him by kicks and punches\. Then, the police stole two phones from the boys that they had bought before their journey, one for 200 euros\. Akram asked the officers, whether they could apply for asylum in Croatia, but the police responded to them that in Croatia there was no asylum for them and kicked into Arkam’s legs\.

Following the physical attack, the boys were transported by a car directly to the Bosnian border for their deportation\. The journey took about 30 minutes, and there were the only ones inside\. Arkam told that the car was driving very fast and was breaking occasionally, so that they were falling from one side to another\.

**Details**

_Expressed intention to seek asylum in the country_ : No

_Documents signed_ : Yes \(fee for irregular entry to Slovenia\)

**DESCRIPTION OF INDICENT**

Adnan and other 40 men travelled by foot from Bihac \(Bosnia\), crossed Croatia, and continued to Slovenia\. After seven days of walking, they reached Slovenia, from where they supposed to be picked up by two taxis that were organise by people smugglers\. They were waiting for five days in a forest in Slovenia for a car transport, at the prearranged point with a smuggler\. Adnan told that the smuggler did not specify the time when he would meet them, so they were waiting there for five days\. They ran out of food and water and Adnan did not feel well\. The fifth day, two vans picked them up\. Adnan was being transported in a boot of one van with another 19 men\. When they were driving around 4 km close to the border with Italy, they were stopped by the Slovenian police\.

Adnan told that the driver ran away and left them inside of the car\. The Slovenian police was treating the men with respect when they caught them and transported them to a police station\. At the police station, the Slovenian officers questioned them about their nationality and their intentions in Slovenia\.

_“The Slovenian police were asking us where we are from and etc\. I have the paper from Slovenia \[the fine\] \. They said that I have a fine that I have crossed the border illegally, but if you can’t pay it, it is ok, we will not request it from you\. The behaviour of Slovenian police was very good”_ \(Adnan\) \.

Adnan also told me that they were provided with the help of a translator from Pakistan at the police station\. They spent one day in custody, and after they were transported to Croatia and handed over to the Croatian police officers, who were also treating the men with respect\.

In the end, the men were finally taken to the Bosnian border, where they were told to change the car, which was driven by a different group of policemen; the Croatian border police that was in the charge of their deportation back to Bosnia\. This Croatian border police unit drove the men to a remote area close to the official border check\-point in Maljevac \(the border between Croatia and Bosnia\) \.

Once they arrived at the border, the police opened a door of the van and started pointing a torch to the men’s faces\. The officer told them to come outside of the van, one by one, and always before they exited the van, they had pointed a torch into their eyes so that they could not see anything when they were outside of the van\. When they exited the van, the police physically attacked them\. Adnan told that he struggled to see from where the officers were attacking him, as he had got blinded by a torch and the police men wore black uniforms, so he could not see them in the dark\. Adnan described the attack in the following way:

_“We were 20 in one van\. They \[Croatian border police\] said to us to come one by one\. They opened the door, one guy came out, they closed the door, and we just hear the voices “ooouu”\.They were in the shape of groups in five or six \[police\] \. One group was standing near the van, one group little far from the van, one group also far from the van\. Two police men hold one guy, put him down on the ground, then after, they started beating him\. After three or four minutes, they said to him: “Go Italia\! If you want to go to Italia, go to Italia\! Now go Bosnia, there is Bosnia\!” But after when he was walking away, the other group \[of police men\] caught him and they beat him again\. After that when the second group of police let us go, the third group caught us and started beating us again …\. I could not run anywhere, they were everywhere in front of us … One guy was telling them: “My arm is broken, my arm is broken\!” but they did not leave him\. They were laughing at us\. When they were beating us, they were laughing … You can see on my back I have lines after hit\.”_ \(Adnan\) \.

The Croatian border police also stole the men’s bags, where they had all their phones, money, and power banks\. Adnan then walked from the place of the deportation to the makeshift camp in Velika Kladuša, but struggled to walk as he was injured on his chest and legs:

_“I was on a hill, and I fell from the top on my chest\. I also had pain in my back and front and could see that the blood is coming from outside\. I felt like I was drunk\. I fell, and I was alone, I had no phone, and was thinking how to contact my friends now and take some taxi? My legs were shaking, so I could not walk\. When I came down, no one was on the road\. I needed a water\. Nothing was in my pocket\. One guy came to that road, and I begged him to give me water, and he gave me water\. After, he went inside of a bar and I walked\. I never forget this moment of my life\. That was the first time, I am 22, but this night was very dark night for me\. My chest hurt me like somebody shoot me on my chest\. And I can’t tell you the feelings of that night”_ \(Adnan\) \.

At the end of the interview, Adnan told that during this attempt to reach asylum in the EU, he lost his last money\. Now, he struggles to move forward from the Bosnian transit, where he lives under a plastic sheet shelter in the “camp” in Velika Kladuša, but he can’t go to Pakistan, back to the life in poverty:

_“They \[Croatian border police\] took everything from us\. They did not give us our bags and I had everything in my bag\. If we belong to the strong family, we would not have to come here\. But we are not financially strong, so that is why we came here\. You know, in Pakistan, you work for 5 to 6 euros per day\. In Europe, maybe it is 50 euros\. You need — 3 euros for your food\. What do you give to your family? How much money my family can send me \[now\]? I have already lost 2\.300 euros in Bosnia because I paid to agent \[smuggler\] and he did not give me back”_ \(Adnan\) \.

**DESCRIPTION OF INDICENT**

Rokan and his family, sister and her two children, walked from Velika Kladuša \(Bosnia and Herzegovina\) to Croatia, from where they wanted to continue to Slovenia, the place where they wanted to seek asylum\. Rokan told that they have been searching for a safe place in Europe and they chose Slovenia as they considered this as the first country in the EU that was safe for them\. They did not want to apply for asylum in Croatia as they had experienced there several episodes of violence at the border\.

The fourth day of their journey, when they were walking inside of Croatia, around 35 km from the Bosnian border, they were detected by 12 Croatian police officers\. The police officers were acting aggressively towards the family and questioned them whether they were led by a smuggler, where they were from and what their intentions in Croatia were\. The police then frisked their all bodies, including the woman and children, and stole all their possessions\. Following that, the officers physically attacked Rokan by hands, in front of the children:

_“They \[Croatian police\] were asking me: “Who is with you?\! Tell us\!” I told them just this family\. “Are you sure?” I said to them, “Yes, I am sure\.” It was just me, my sister, and her two kids, one child is 5 years old and one 7 years old\. … They broke phone that belonged to my sister and hit me into my back and my leg also, something horrible\. The kids were crying, and they did not care\. They did not care\. The children should not see something like this, maybe they will never forget this”_ \(Rokan\) \.

After the physical attack, the whole family was transported straight to the Bosnian border for their deportation\. Inside of the van, there were other people who were also caught by the police while walking through Croatia\. The journey to the border took around 40 minutes\. The car was driving very fast and Rokan felt sick inside\.

When they arrived at the border it could be 5 am\. Everyone was told to get off the van, one by one\. After that, the police again attacked everyone, accept women and children, and told them to go back to Bosnia:

_“They took us one by one from the car and beating us\. Children were crying and screaming and they did not care”_ \(Rokan\) \.

At the end of the interview, Rokan told that he had never experienced worse treatment than by the Croatian police through his journey to Europe:

_“I came from my country, from Iraq, walking in the mountains, I saw Turkish army, I saw Greek army, Albanian, Montenegro, Bosnian army, they are all different, but Croatian police and army are so bad, why? In the end, we are all human\. Why do they do this? Why do they hit me? Why you do this to my sister with kids crying? I don’t know\. Maybe they hate Muslims, I don’t know”_ \(Rokan\) \.

**INFORMATION ABOUT THE PERPETRATORS**

**DESCRIPTION OF INDICENT**

Ali walked alone from Velika Kladuša \(Bosnia and Herzegovina\) to Croatia\. He wanted to continue to Slovenia and then to Italy, where we wanted to seek asylum\. When he was walking still in Croatia, but close to the Slovenian border, he got detected by three Croatian police officers\.

**DESCRIPTION OF INDICENT**

Heidar walked in a group of 32 men, all from Bangladesh, from Velika Kladuša \(BiH\) to Croatia, and from there to Slovenia\. When the group was crossing the road A1, they were caught by three Slovenian police men\. The police asked the men to show their identification documents, but they did not have any\. The officers firstly searched through the men’s bags and frisked their bodies but did not take any of theirs possessions\. According to Heidar, he told the police that he wanted to stay in Slovenia, apply for asylum and work there\. But the police only responded to him: “No, no, no”\. Following that, all men were transported to a police station, where they stayed detained in a cell for one night\.

Heidar told that the Slovenian police officers were treating them with respect, gave them new clothes, water and food\. The police took the men’s fingerprints and photographed them\. This was the second time that Heider has been arrested in Slovenia while crossing through the country, so once the police took his fingerprints, they could find the information from his previous detention\. The police asked the men to sign paper documents \(8 of them\), but they did not understand what was written there as these documents were written in the Slovenian language and the men were not provided a translator\. Only two boys from their group, who were 18 years old, were accessed the asylum procedures and transported to an asylum accommodation in Slovenia\.

The following day, the rest, including Heider, were transported to the Croatian border, where they were handed over to the Croatian police\. From this point, they were picked up by two vans and driven to the Bosnian border for their deportation back to Bosnia\. Heider told that they the van did not have any lights inside, so they were sitting in the darkness\. They were twenty people squeezed in a boot of one van during their transportation to the border\.

Once they arrived at the border, close to the official border check\-point in Maljevac, they were told to get off the van, one by one, and run back to Bosnia\. When the men started running away, they fell over ropes, that the police had set as a trap, and then severally attacked by batons\. Heider described the violent incident in the following way:

_“When we came to the border, they \[police officers\] took different position, standing in several lines\. When people came outside, one by one, they made a trap; they put a rope in the way and when people were running outside of the hill, they fell because there was a rope\. And when we fell, from jungle, the police came with big sticks and started beating us\. When we crossed the trap \[the rope\], they were beating us again\. … The police officer who was beating me broke his stick \[baton\] on me\. They were big men with masks”_ \(Heider\) \.

The men then walked to Velika Kladus to a makeshift camp, where they temporarily live\.

After about an hour \(01:00\) the eight men were taken outside and loaded into a combi vehicle\. They were not the only passengers, as the rear hold area already contained fourteen men\. The men were from another group of refugees, also in the process of being pushed back\. The van was cramped and made them feel sick because there were too many people inside\. The combi left the station and began its journey \(now containing 24 people in total\) \.

**DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT**

The group of fifteen Kurdish people \(from the Iranian region\) had been walking on foot through the wooded hills of the Croatian interior\. After four days of travelling the group were apprehended by Croatian police\. The interaction with the police began near the roadside of the M1, approximately 30km north of the town of Slunj\. The men were walking in close woodland when they were observed at a short distance by two Croatian police officer dressed in blue uniforms\.

They were ordered by the police to stop and sit down\. The group complied and waited while the police checked their possessions and frisked them\. The police told them that if they co\-operated now, they would be treated fairly\. They also told the group; _“If you give your cell phone now you will get it back at border”\._ After their seizure in the woods, the men were led by the two officers to the road where a police patrol car was parked\. After some minutes a combi van arrived at the location and the men were immediately loaded into the back\-passenger area\. The van was cramped and they drove in this condition for over an hour\.

When the van stopped they were unloaded from the vehicle in a semi\-rural area\. It was hilly farmland, with some small houses in the distance\. Six or seven more officers were waiting for them, all dressed in blue, one being female\. The officer \(male\) stood closest to the back of the combi was wearing a face mask, so only his eyes could be seen\. He had a large gun that was attacked to a shoulder harness\. The men described it as similar to a Kalashnikov\. As the group began to exit the back of the van the police officer fired three rounds into the air, just over their heads\.

He then withdrew a black baton from the holster on his waist and began to attack every man as they exited the van\. The officer used severe force, hitting the victims in the face, on the torso, arms and legs\. One victim was struck heavily across the eye socket and nose, causing bruising and bleeding\. The other officers stood back an laughed as the main perpetrator in the mask attacked people\. The respondent describes how; _“the police sit more back and laugh”\._

When the beating had finished one of the other officers approached the group and gave back a handful of phones that had been broken by the officers in the van\. The victim shared that the police had tricked them because when they’d been caught in the woods the officers had told them that co\-operating would earn them fair treatment\. _“If you \(refugees\) be good, we police be good with you, but they lie to us, they hit us and stole our phones”\._

The group fled back into Bosnia to escape further violence, because once again the officer with the baton began to threaten, and even chase them\. It was just after midday and they walked for an hour in order to return to the camp in Velika Kladuša\.

**DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT**

The group of men and two boys were first seen by police after seven days of walking through the Croatian interior\. They had just passed near to a village and were crossing a small road around twenty minutes later\. Two police officers arrived in blue and shouted at them to stop\.

It was dusk, but the group saw that the men were dressed in blue Croatian uniforms, and as they approached, they were ordered to sit down\. All twenty\-two people were ordered to stay still as they were searched and had their possessions removed by the officers\. A combi was brought along the road and from the verge, the twenty men and two minors were loaded into the rear passenger area\. It was a tight and uncomfortable squeeze\.

The combi brought the men to a police station where they were led inside and in a anti\- room\. Each person, including the two minors, were strip searched, which including having their trousers pulled down and shows taken off\.

Then they were ordered to give their details for processing\. The men did not sign any documents or give fingerprints\. The police just asked for their name, nationality, DOB and fathers name\. This was put onto a board which they were made to hold in front of themselves as the officers made photographs \(facing forward and both profiles\) \. The minors were registered as over 18s by the custody sergeant, meaning neither accessed the legal protection owed to them\.

When the photographs were being taken, members of the group asked for the opportunity to make an asylum claim\. The respondent shared with me that: _“stay no, Croatia stay no”\._

Added to this, the police even searched through their possessions and ripped up their Bosnian white papers\. During their ordeal they were offered no refreshment, despite being in police custody for eight hours\.

After the police station they were loaded back into a combi, again in severely cramped conditions\. The journey from the station took around four hours and was sickening for the whole group\. At 3am the group arrived to a rural border location next to a small river\. The car was parked at the top of the steep slope\.

As the doors were opened the police present were waiting at the back\. There were six dressed in black and wearing face masks to protect their identity\. The group of 22 victims were beckoned out one by one and beaten by the Croatian police\. The officers attacked at a ratio of 4:1, using two to restrain and two to beat with their batons\.

The men received bruising, and skin trauma from the severe assault\. During the attack the victim had his knee struck severely with a baton, causing a major sprain and swelling\. And also suffered a sprained ankle\. He received scratch marks and bruising across his body and head\.

As the assault continued, the officers chased the men down into the steep ravine where the Glina river runs\. The officers struck the men and boys over the head with their batons as they scrambled and fell down into the ditch\.

The final remarks from the police shouted in English to the men as they fled were: _“go Bosnia\!”_

The arresting officers were two Croatian police dressed in blue who participated in the theft of the group’s belongings\. At the station the processing officers participated in the strip search and doctoring of information \(signing the minors as \+18\) \.

**INJURIES AND MEDICAL TREATMENT**
