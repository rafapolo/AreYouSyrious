More than one billion euros are used for cash\-assistance\. Credits: Facebook/ [European Commission — Civil Protection & Humanitarian Aid Operations — ECHO](https://www.facebook.com/ec.humanitarian.aid/photos/a.377376547905/10156205813867906/?type=3&theater)

It is quite difficult to follow the cash flows in the sector of humanitarian aid\. The European Court of Auditors \(ECA\) is an institution with better access to such information\. The auditors have [now checked](https://www.eca.europa.eu/Lists/ECADocuments/INSR18_27/INSR_TRF_EN.pdf) , how the three billion euros intended for the facility for refugees in Turkey [have been used](https://www.eca.europa.eu/Lists/ECADocuments/SR18_27/SR_TRF_EN.pdf) \. The money was awarded for a period of three years as part of the EU\-Turkey deal, which came [into force in March 2016](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/legislative-train/theme-towards-a-new-policy-on-migration/file-eu-turkey-statement-action-plan) \. This money was meant to be used until the end of 2018 but was spent already by June this year\. Hence, another three billion euros have been contracted until 2020, as was promised in the deal\. But this second tranche was not part of ECA research\.

The ECA might honor some of the efforts made with these funds\. But it would have been more than worrying if there hadn’t been any such efforts\. More interesting is the inefficient use of these funds\. The ECA criticizes that the humanitarian projects “have not always delivered the expected value for money”\. In the case of cash assistance, only half of the projects achieved the expected outcome\. At the same time, most of them delivered all or most of the intended output\. Nine out of ten projects had to be extended due to the challenging environment, which was hindering timely implementation\.

Cash assistance is just one example of how inefficiently these funds have been used\. This ECA rates this at 50 percent efficiency for all the money used — coming to a total of 1\.5 billion euros\. “The audited projects provided helpful support to refugees; most of them have achieved their outputs, but half of them have not yet achieved their expected outcomes,” the auditors sum up\. This counts for all sectors, whether it was municipal infrastructure, socio\-economic support, waste disposal, or integration into the labor market\.

One reason for this was the difficulty of collaborating with the Turkish authorities\. Why money is being spent before the outcome is known is already questionable, but criticism also applies to the facility itself\. Similar types of activities in health and education have been supported by different instruments\. The ECA states: “This made coordination more complex and resulted in the parallel use of different management structures to fund similar projects\.”

But the criticism goes even further, saying the Commission did not check the proposals properly\.


> Firstly, when reviewing project proposals, the Commission did not consistently and comprehensively assess the reasonableness of the budgeted costs\. 




On the other hand, the indirect costs paid to partners were too high\. The ECA names — again — in particular the large cash assistance projects\. “The level of advance payments was not aligned with the actual cash outflows of the projects,” say the auditors\. Although they do not name names, the Commission’s facility table shows that the UN’s World Food Programme \(WFP\) was contracted with €650,000,000 \(net payments to project: €520,000,000\) to run the so\-called [Emergency Social Safety Net](https://ec.europa.eu/echo/essn_en) \(ESSN\) with the Turkish Red Crescent to provide cash assistance for vulnerable refugees\. “Refugee families currently receive 120 Turkish Liras \(about €30\) per family member per month, with an additional quarterly top\-up depending on the size of the family,” says the info page\. Their latest [information](https://ec.europa.eu/echo/field-blogs/photos/putting-smile-refugee-children-turkey_en) says that 1\.3 million people benefited from the programme, more than half of them children\. The info page does not state, however, how much money was actually disbursed at this point\. For a second project related to ESSN, the WFP received €348,000,000 \(net payments: €278,400,000\) \. This makes a total of almost one billion \(€700,000,000\) — a third of the total money allocated to Turkey under the facility\.

Another programme linked to cash assistance is the Conditional Cash Transfer for Education \(CCTE\), which is run by UNICEF\. The UN’s child protection body was contracted with €50,000,000 \(net payments: €40,000,000\) for “the integration of refugee children into the national education system through a financial incentive when the children attend classes regularly\.” As the educational system in Turkey only allows children to attend classes who already have language skills, it can be assumed that many children have not been able to benefit from this support\. According to [UNICEF](http://www.unicef.org.tr/unicef-lp/index.html) , 356,611 students benefited from the program\. Child protection services were given to 36,342 children, and 3,245 were referred to specialized services\. For another educational cash assistance programme, UNICEF received €34,000,000 \(net payments: €27,200,000\) \. In total, the UN body had a budget of €84,000,000 \(€67,000,000\) \.

Additionally, the Diakonie was given €5,500,000 and the Welthungerhilfe €2,600,000 for cash\-assistance programmes\. Also a 50 million euro project, which included cash assistance for work, was awarded to the World Bank\. The contracted amounts can be seen on the Commission’ [s facility table](https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/facility_table.pdf) \.

This shows that this is not only about how much money is being sent somewhere — what matters more is, how the money is being used\. The ECA concludes: “The facility could have been more effective, and it could have achieved more value for the money\.”

Back in February of this year, DG Echo told AYS in a statement about the funds used in Turkey: _“Each project is carefully monitored by the staff in the EU Delegation to Turkey/ECHO local office as well as by staff at European Commission Headquarters, through regular implementation meetings with the contractor and on\-the spot monitoring\. Projects with NGOs are grants given to implement specific actions\. Payments under grants are made based on reported incurred costs in accordance with the general conditions of the individual grant contract\. These costs are verified before further pre\-financing or final payment takes place\. Should any irregularities be detected or costs declared ineligible, the European Commission can recover the funds or impose penalties\.”_

### Syria

The Syrian Network for Human Rights has released several reports over the last days: Yesterday, a man was [arrested](http://sn4hr.org/sites/news/2018/11/14/syrian-regime-forces-arrested-civilian-damascus-city-november-13/?fbclid=IwAR0-EhfWZ3BmA565BcJ1DY7Ths6G3Y7zP9JljcqsRU93xSFKU4264tm7ZnI) near Daraa by government forces and was taken to an unknown place\. Hurras al\-Dien and Tahrir al\-Sham [arrested](http://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=106675&fbclid=IwAR3lew5r8fKAUPX_4DpCewJXfjdsgFy9x7v7wTDVTYFhgKLp5WJDzHfgD6A) more than 20 people in 30 days for different accusations\. During a [bombing](http://sn4hr.org/sites/news/2018/11/14/international-coalition-forces-committed-massacre-hajin-city-deir-ez-zour-suburbs-november-11/?fbclid=IwAR3dXdpNI3zx6VhSICriYHJAMxUQrHe_zTUHdmsFCGZ65-hDtIYth9-dgOY) of the International Coalition, twelve civilians, including four girls and two women, were killed near Deir Ez\-Zour on 11 November\. In [Hama](http://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=106664&fbclid=IwAR36cBHr4U1WJc6Gn2KQ6obSGQVi7ouKf5XrSPovcsgDFSwAFgARuYwJs48) , prisoners are on their third day of hunger strike, fearing they will be killed in detention\. And in Afrin, there have been new [armed attacks](http://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=106649&fbclid=IwAR3uKAMvQTbepz1N-__SwqOh7qqb2LahAnfEoxIcfBdYBzHGTHvyVz4mZtc) against the “Olive Branch” operation\.

In an update from the spring when the Syrian government passed a law stating that people who had abandoned property in Syria had to prove ownership within one month, this timeline has now been extended to one year\. [Skeptics state that a year is often also not enough](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2018/11/12/syria-regime-pass-controversial-property-law?fbclid=IwAR23pP0AxCGiRkMN1NTtzj_G3dVW9jWXahfqhiHYEhnYc_-QqC5LgeIS7lw) , and as one\-third of the country’s housing has been destroyed in the war, it seems unlikely that this extension will change anything\.
### Libya

People who were taken back to Libya after being rescued from the Mediterranean refused to disembark\. They arrived in Libya on Monday\. A total of 95 people were rescued while only two have decided to disembark\. More can be read [here](https://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFL8N1XN4DD?fbclid=IwAR3N4d_o7SLl4mm0JpCd9z71aDh_DH7BZV6Do48GXMOUXi3bxEhYCucvquY) \.
### Greece

The Greek police have arrested more than 5,600 people who traveled with fake documents since January of this year\. The majority were caught on Crete, Santorini, Thessaloniki, and Athens, reports Refugee\.Info\. Although this does not impact the asylum process, the people will face a trial and will not be issued a travel document\. Additionally, the sentence may be imprisonment for at least six months\.

Between Saturday morning and today, some 600 people have been transferred from the Aegean islands to the Attica region, [reports](http://www.kathimerini.gr/994886/article/epikairothta/ellada/se-3enodoxeia-sthn-attikh-prosfyges?fbclid=IwAR2jAnoipVeHkFuuLlJWQ0VtNVP1H5yNWHGRZUM1NeBi3ZZA5Iq24v0rSbE) Kathimerini\. They are considered vulnerable and should not be spending the winter in the hotspots\. Two hundred fifty people arrived on the islands\. At the same time, the flow at the land border to Turkey remains high: almost 2,000 people were arrested while crossing Evros River and 76 smugglers were caught\. Between July and the end of November, more than 6,500 people were arrested while attempting to cross over into Greece\. In this area the [reports of violent push\-backs](https://www.facebook.com/ali.surveyor.7/videos/957208127808814/) \(warning: graphic content\! \) are piling up\.


Refugee 4 Refugees opened their warehouse on Lesvos yesterday\.

### GERMANY

According to Refugee Support Aegean, Germany has just deported 42 people to Afghanistan which is still in the throes of the aftermath of yet another bloody attack that has taken many civilian lives\. They go on to note that 425 people have been deported from Germany in the previous two years\. The article referenced is in [German](https://thruttig.wordpress.com/2018/11/13/vor-deutschem-abschiebeflug-nr-18-nach-afghanistan-keine-abschiebungsbeobachtung-in-leipzig-taleban-vormarsch-und-vertreibungen/) \.
### FRANCE

Donations needed in Paris\! Hundreds of people still rely on volunteer operations for a decent meal, as Solidarite Migrants Wilson reports:

“All right\! We had more guests last night at our meal 🍽️ than the previous week: over 300 for about 250 Tuesday last\. On the menu a dish condiment and cooked\-as usual with care by baya, pasta, meat and vegetables, super good… to complete we also recovered last night an important gift from a friend of jouy\-En\-josas : Fruit and water bottles\. 🍏🍌🍊 and unsold bread of the day given by bakers… Orange juice too, given by a volunteer\.”

They are also in serious need of hygiene items\. As winter is well underway in Europe, winter items are also in high demand\. If you are able to donate, please follow the link [here](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1022128321321273&id=598228360377940) \.

Additionally, Care4Calais is in dire need of donations as there are still many people, repeatedly displaced in clearings, who also only have thin, summer clothing\.

“The Jungle had a population of over 8,000 people and when the camp was cleared, where do you think all those thousands of people went? They all dispersed and now live in underpasses, roundabouts, industrial estates and on any land they can find\. They are constantly being moved by French Police and most of them don’t know when their next meal will be\.

Right now the weather in Calais is below than 10°C during the day and even lower at night\. This weekend I met several young men wearing t\-shirts and thin jumpers — they did not have proper coats and it was just starting to rain\. I was so glad we were able to get warm waterproof jackets for them, but sadly I know there are nowhere near enough for everyone and it’s only going to get colder\.”

Donate [here](https://www.facebook.com/care4calais/posts/2180716708627941) \.
### UK

Right to Remain reports that the Home Office ordered people living in Stoke\-on\-Trent with pending asylum and immigration claims to travel to a court some 40 miles away to report\. Before, reporting was possible at the local police station\. “Navigating this six hour return journey is difficult for those who are fit and healthy, but it is virtually impossible for those who are single parents and must bring their children with them, or have mental or physical health issues,” [says](https://righttoremain.org.uk/people-made-take-routine-40-mile-trips-immigration-claims/?fbclid=IwAR1AbGsHHFTP7W_G-2Wy_aKrQm-gMuCB7ZXXYEW2nFOnGg4QrIgsubBDAtY) the group\.
