### Feature

For today’s feature, we are sharing a report published by search and rescue organisation Mare Liberum on the deadly border in the Aegean Sea\. Mare Liberum writes:


> _On June 29th the Turkish Coast Guard picked up a dinghy in distress\. The boat had reached Greek waters before but was stopped there by the Hellenic Coast Guard\. Instead of rescuing the people from the absolutely unseaworthy dinghy as it would have been their duty, the Coast Guard took away their fuel and pushed the 40 people on board back to Turkish waters\. The Turkish Coast Guard managed to rescue 35 survivors, but four have been reported missing\. They found one dead body by now and it is very likely that the other three are dead, too\. Pushbacks by the Hellenic Coast Guard are not new and happen almost on a daily basis\. The loss of life in these operations is alarming, but not surprising\. The Turkish and Hellenic Coast Guard as well as FRONTEX and NATO play their brutal power games on the backs of refugees, who try to cross Europe’s deadly border, and thereby make the crossing to a life and death struggle\. Clearly, in these dynamics the surviving of refugees becomes trivial\. There are many reports about the illegal and inhumane methods used by the authorities: engines are being destroyed or taken away, the tubes of the dinghies are slit open, people in the boats are being abused and have to stay on the water for hours, the Hellenic Coast Guard creates waves to push the boats to Turkish waters or tows them there directly, refugees are being left at sea in so called life rafts — the list is endless\._ 





> _In some cases, refugees had already reached land on one of the Aegean islands before they were brought back to Turkish waters\. On May 22nd 2020 a boat with 31 people on board arrived on Samos\. The police came to the scene and put everyone in a bus, but instead of bringing them to a camp, they were brought back to the shoreline, put in a tiny dinghy \(like a children’s toy\) and were taken to Turkish waters by the Hellenic Coast Guard\. One of the refugees on board fell in the water during the pushback and drowned\. We talked to two of his friends: The young man was afraid of crossing the Aegean for a long time\. He was scared of the sea\. But when almost all of his friend made it to one of the Greek islands, even though none of them succeeded on first try, he decided to try it after all\. Knowing this, it is even more dramatic that he made it to Samos first and then drowned in the pushback\. He was buried in a forest in Turkey and his family in Congo probably doesn’t know about what happened to him\. The Hellenic Coast Guard is responsible for his death\._ 





> _According to the Missing Migrants Project by IOM over 20\.000 migrants lost their lives in the Mediterranean sea since 2014 and this is only a fraction of the people who actually try to cross Europe’s deadly border\. Since not every shipwreck is reported on, nobody really knows how many people have died trying to reach Europe\._ 





> _If those who drown were white, the topic would probably get a lot more attention and there would be memorials, speeches, wreath\-laying ceremonies and most importantly: Political changes\. But since those who drown are black or PoC, they are simply being forgotten\. But black and migrant lives matter and we cannot allow Europe to forget that\!_

### Sea

InfoMigrant recently spoke to German NGO Sea\-Watch regarding their recent acquisition of their new aircraft the ‘Seabird’\. The aircraft was acquired in cooperation with the Swiss Humanitarian Pilots Initiative \(HPI\) and will be used for civil air reconnaissance missions off the coast of Libya\. Describing how Sea\-Watch uses their aircrafts during rescue missions, Kai, the NGOs technical coordinator, had this to say:


> _From the air, you can cover much greater distances than on a humanitarian ship\. You really get a better overview of the situation, whereas on a ship, you are much more limited\. In June alone, we performed 14 missions and spotted 21 boats with more than 940 migrants in total in distress\. And those are just the boats we spotted\. We must also take into account the hundreds of migrants intercepted by Libya’s coast guard, or those who disappear without even leaving a trace of the shipwreck\._ 





> _What remains most impressive for me is to see how vast the central Mediterranean is, and how there are just so few ships and so little help for migrants\. We spend six to eight hours flying over the sea in our small planes, and sometimes we can’t find anyone\. But other times we manage to make a real impact\. That’s what pushes us to go back to flying every time\._ 





> _We have completed about 290 missions since 2017\. We didn’t really keep statistics at the beginning, but we estimate that we’ve spotted about 20,000 people in distress\._ 





In the interview, Kai further described what happens when during flying the aircraft they spot a boat in distress:


> _When we spot a boat in distress, we inform our ground crew of its position\. They then pass this information on to the authorities, namely the Italian, Maltese and Libyan coast guard MRCCs, \[Maritime Rescue Coordination Center\], so that everyone is informed and can take action\. Our main problem is that they are completely unresponsive\. For example, with Libya, we call nine different numbers to try to alert the rescue services, but each time we come across people who claim not to speak English\. It’s not just the Libyans who are not responsive\. Today we called the MRCC in Malta to inform them of a boat in distress in their waters\. They told us that they refused to communicate with NGOs\. They don’t care\._

In a statement published yesterday, [The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies](https://media.ifrc.org/ifrc/press-release/red-cross-red-crescent-alarmed-increase-migrant-drownings-mediterranean/?fbclid=IwAR1HCWyIFmwWCFelwoWveJfjhqHnIh5B-Zoyg1ipmH19gJlpxJRyY5FOUXU) said that they are alarmed at the increase in migrant drownings in the Mediterranean\. The statement indicates that Red Crescent Societies in both Tunisia and Libya are seeing an increase in drownings on the shores of North Africa and have suggested the warmer weather and recent relaxation of COVID\-19 lockdown measures may be behind the recent increase\. According to the IOM, 20 % more people are estimated to have died in June this year compared to last year\.

IFRC President Francesco Rocca said:


> _While Red Cross volunteers in Italy support those who have managed to survive the crossing, unfortunately on the other side of the Mediterranean, both Libyan and Tunisian Red Crescent volunteers are left to collect the bodies of those who didn’t\._ 
 

> _Each person who dies trying to cross that deadly stretch of water is more than just a statistic\. They are someone who was full of hope for a better future, with family and friends who loved them, who likely faced countless hardships along the way only to have their life ended, we cannot forget this\._ 




### Estonia

Estonia has granted international protection to 544 people in 23 years\. [Speaking to BNS news service](https://news.err.ee/1111592/estonia-granted-international-protection-to-544-people-in-23-years) , Ruth Annus, head of the Estonian department of citizenship and migration policy said that of the 544 people, 200 had been received as part of the migration programs of the European Union\. So far this year, Estonia has not received any people as part of the resettlement and relocation program\.
### Syria

[The United Nations has reported](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/syria-northeast-people-died-refugee-camps-report?fbclid=IwAR37ggG9yqekVkqjgm02vHJwJ8VHz60F86kUxduuGTyk1_vjA31_3WEXHiI) that more than 700 people in two refugee camps in northeast Syria have recently died from a lack of food and Medicine\. The two camps — al\-Hol and Roj — house more than 70,000 people with 9,000 of these being children\.

Despite not clarifying when the 700 died, or who the source was of the information, at a news conference on Thursday, Mr\. Vladimir Voronkov, the [UN’s Under Secretary\-General for Counter\-Terrorism](https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/leadership) , said that the camps are in “ _very dire condition”_ and states that these recent fatalities included children\.

Some international media outlets have speculated if COVID\-19 may have been in part responsible for the fatalities, but so far, there have not been any reports of coronavirus at the camp\. In April, there were reports of COVID cases in Syria’s northeastern area, sparking concern that it may soon spread through these makeshift camps\.

To prepare for any possible outbreak, the Kurdish Red Crescent set up a specialised hospital, based outside the city of Hasakah, with 120 hospital beds and The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs \(OCHA\) has also built an isolation unit outside the al\-Hol camp, with a capacity for 80 beds\.
