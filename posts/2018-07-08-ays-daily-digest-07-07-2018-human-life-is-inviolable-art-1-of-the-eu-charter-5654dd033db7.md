#### Feature — “Human Life is Inviolable” Article 1 of the EU Charter

Numbers of missing and dead people continue to rise in the Mediterranean while EU governments sit back, watch, close their ports and lock their doors\. Since 2015 over 20,600 people have died at sea while attempting to travel from Northern Africa and Southern Europe\. This June, since Salvini became Interior Minister of Italy and other EU states decided to follow his brutal lead, has been the month with the highest death toll since IOM began their records\.

July could well see an even more dire situation arise as [Watch the Med — Alarmphone](https://www.facebook.com/watchthemed.alarmphone/photos/a.1526182797655958.1073741828.1525906057683632/2151100688497496/?type=3&theater) report that two more boats are missing having left the Moroccan coast\.


> A boat carrying 40 people from Asilah/Morocco is lost at sea\. They left already on Thursday at 11pm and the last time a relative of the travellers was in touch with them was at 2am CEST\. Their engine has broken down and they are in great danger\. 





> A second boat carrying 8 people from Achakkar/Morocco is also missing\. Last time we had contact with them was at 10am\. They are also seriously at risk\. 





A [further report](https://twitter.com/HelenaMaleno/status/1015599990570352640) states that another 37 people are also lost at sea, including 7 women, in the Alboran\.

As the Alarmphone call for a larger NGO presence in the Mediterranean, [Lifeline](https://www.facebook.com/seenotrettung/videos/401231083616770/?hc_location=ufi) are asking for support to continue their search and rescue work\. More info on how to help [here](https://civilfleet.org/) \.

And groups throughout Europe are calling for an end to the decriminalisation of sea rescue\.

As with all right\-wing, racist policies there is very little logic behind the actions of those in charge, including the refusal of a safe port to NGO boats\. These people do not require logic, they work on the basis of creating collective fear, just as the fascist regimes did in the first half of the 20th century\. While Salvini stands in front of thousands talking of saving the Italian people and of how dearly he loves Italian children, he forgets that many Italian citizens have African heritage, that it could well be the relative of an Italian citizen, indeed the child of one, who drowns off the Italian coast\. Their lives lost due to racism and the propaganda of fear\. These are crimes against humanity, illegal under the laws of the sea, the 1951 Refugee Convention, the Human Rights Act and of our collective conscience\. When will an EU member state finally stand up and say enough is enough? When will a critical mass of citizens and civil society finally refuse to comply with these policies and through this simple tool end the murderous route that EU leaders are trying to force us down?

#### **Far right Anti\-migrant Patrols on Italian beaches**

As [reported](https://enoughisenough14.org/2018/07/07/italian-and-polish-neo-nazis-join-forces-to-patrol-beaches-to-protect-women-from-migrants/) by Enough is Enough, members of Italian neo\-fascist party Forza Nuova \(FN\), in coalition with Polish neo\-nazi group National Radical Camp \(Obóz Narodowo\-Radykalny, ONR\), launched beach patrols in order to “protect women and children from migrants” in the Italian town Rimini\. The first patrol took place yesterday after a joint conference of the two groups\.

Italian anti\-mafia organisation Libera launched a symbolic campaign in support of humanitarian operations in the Mediterranean and in solidarity with refugees and migrants\. Many other organisations and individuals joined the campaign, wearing red t\-shirts \(magliette rosse\) and posting solidarity pictures on social media, as asylum seekers wear red clothes to be visible in case of distress at sea\.

It is a pity that ministers and MPs of the previous government joined the same protest, while at the same time, many of the them are responsible for initiating this process of the criminalisation of rescue operations\.

Whatever it takes to gain a few more votes\.

> A very nice Bosnian man lent his industrial unit to some refugee friends to take refuge there\. Kids don’t create much garbage\. Those who distribute food at night \(only a few days, not all\) create a lot\. They are from a huge organisation called Emmaus that gives out some pasta with tomato and take thousands of pictures, but then they don’t offer a place to throw away that garbage, that is taken by the wind and dig up by dogs\. Only No Name Kitchen buys garbage bags, every time they appear, and give them to the inhabitants of this space so that they can clean it up\. 





> Today, with my own eyes I saw the Red Cross arrive and distribute a can of tuna, a piece of bread and a few chocolate shakes for children\. Everything in a bag\. In five minutes and without getting off the van\. What they did was taking a lot of pictures\. So many that I went to talk to them about garbage and they couldn’t answer me because they have to show their millions of donors how cool they are\. They came with a representative of IOM, another of the huge global association for migrants\. When they left, they took their garbage and added it to the huge pile surrounding the kids \(many of them are underage\) \. I told them they’d better take their stuff to a dumpster than leave it there, but they went away, showing very stressed by the job\.
 

> 
 

> Since I arrived at Velika Kladuša I’ve been wondering where the huge global organisations for refugees are \(those that show you to dramatic ads such as UNHCR and that are lined with Euros\) \. Those who help here are about 10 volunteers who try to cover a myriad of basic needs of hundreds of refugees and who live with them day by day without taking pictures
