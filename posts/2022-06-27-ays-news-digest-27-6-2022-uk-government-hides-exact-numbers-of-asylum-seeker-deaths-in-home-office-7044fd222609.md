### TURKEY
#### Violent physical attacks and hate speech on the rise against Syrian refugees in Turkey

Within a month, there were two separate killings of 2 Syrians solely within Istanbul\.

A Syrian refugee currently residing in Istanbul, stated:


> “Incidents against Syrians are being repeated everywhere in Turkey, especially in schools and the workplace\. Hate speech and racism are currently at its highest levels, especially by political parties that incite against Syrian refugees\.” 





> “I face almost daily racism by Turkish youth, not to mention that the employer pays me a wage according to his liking and refused to obtain a work permit for me\. If the authorities know about that, I will be the culprit\. But I did not find any other job\.”

### GREECE
#### Greece plans to extend the land frontier fence with Turkey

Greece has recently been experienced another in asylum seekers trying to enter the country from Turkey\. The number of people has increased by roughly 20% compared to last year’s figures\.

As a response to this increase, and the ongoing political tensions between Greece and Turkey, the government plans to add another 80km of barbed wire and steel to the 40km border fence\.

The Greek Coast Guard has confirmed that they were two male individuals who had tried to cross from Turkey to Greece\.

### UKRAINE
#### Europol has identified a high risk of human trafficking and exploitation of Ukrainian refugee women

Investigators checked 125 online platforms in 14 different countries, identifying 9 suspected human traffickers\. Almost 42 suspicious online platforms were identified\.

Europol has issued a warning to host countries, urging them to be vigilant and ensure there is appropriate safeguarding and monitoring of any potential human trafficking\.

### SERBIA

The latest Info Park newsletter stated:


> “No medical aid for refugees in Serbia\. On 8 June, Info Park registered third case in the last two weeks of refugees being denied medical aid in health centers across Serbia\. A day prior, young man from Afghanistan with severe signs of concussion was identified by the Info Park’s mobile team\. The young man was taken to OSP Miksalište where the workers of Serbian Commissariat for Refugees and Migrantions \(SCRM\) called for an ambulance, and he was transferred to Clinical Center in Belgrade\. The next day, June 8th, the young man was seen in the park again, still in poor health condition, showing signs of dizziness, balance problems, head pressure, nausea, vomiting, and blurry vision\. He told IP’s team that after he was taken to the hospital, he was left in the waiting room and was not treated nor anyone from the medical staff talked to him\. After 4–5 hours of waiting, he left the hospital on his own and returned to the park where other refugees were trying to help him by bringing him water and keeping him in a lying position\. He told IP’s team that he will try to go to the reception center in Adaševci and ask for medical help there\. On the following day, June 9th, Info Park learned that the young man was accepted in RC in Adaševci, however he was only able to receive painkillers for the camp’s doctor and his condition didn’t improve\. Unfortunately, there are no existing mechanisms to prevent the neglect and discrimination of health institutions towards the refugees in Serbia since there are no organizations capable of accompanying the refugees and migrants during hospital visits on a regular basis\. A few days following the incident, another 18\-year\-old man from Afghanistan with acute medical condition was accompanied by SCRM staff and accepted and treated at the same medical facility\. This only proves that the accessibility of the medical aid varies considerably depending on the presence of the NGOs or other humanitarian staff\.”

#### First stage of the European Pact on Migration and Asylum to be introduced

This Pact is meant to act as a ‘solidarity plan’, seeking to encourage EU states to relocate asylum seekers arriving at European shores\. If states do not want to be a part of this initiative, they are obligated to provide financial support instead\.

### SPAIN
#### As previously mentioned in the [AYS News Digest 24/6/22](ays-news-digest-24-6-22-deaths-at-the-border-with-spain-44683109e846) , on Friday, 24th June, 2000 people tried to cross the Moroccan\-Spanish border, into Melilla

500 people succeeded, however, the death toll has now risen to 23, with an extra 76 people being injured\. Some organisations have claimed that the [death toll is likely to be as high as 37](https://www.publico.es/internacional/respaldo-bruselas-actuacion-melilla-cruce-forzado-violento-tolerarse.html?fbclid=IwAR10IRSKFscQAUnKNMSKIOjobbYVOCmuQtszKaCoaiOjlJYrMaNhRgzV-rA) \.

The Spanish Prime Minister, Pedro Sanchez, [called this a “violent assault” and was the work of “mafias who traffic human beings”](https://www.politico.eu/article/death-toll-23-melilla-border-crossing-stampede/?fbclid=IwAR33fuREFOOYSXPchlaU7V1mI9xpqAWeulH7yt77qqDNRTFnco-70xj5OTk) \.

Ylva Johansson further stated that she was deeply concerned with the loss of life, however as Lena K points out below, there is no sense of accountability on the part of EU border policy\.

### UK
#### Since 2020, dozens of asylum seekers, who were recognised as particularly vulnerable by the Home Office, have passed away in government accommodation

The Observer and Liberty Investigates have discovered that between April 2016 and May 2022, there was 107 deaths in Home Office accommodation\.

In addition, since January 2020, there have 82 deaths\. Around 40 individuals were considered to have had a ‘safeguarding element’ which meant the Home Office viewed them as having particular vulnerabilities that needed to be addressed and monitored\.

Many believe there are ‘systemic failures’ and gaps in the safeguarding policies within the Home Office\.
