### Afghanistan

The UNHCR is [warning](https://www.unhcr.org/news/briefing/2021/7/60ed3ba34/unhcr-warns-imminent-humanitarian-crisis-afghanistan.html?fbclid=IwAR25p3Xbn89dBUJc6AczERg1FO09fvflJHrLii_OuWbEEtUWyztaEkAUH00) of a humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan as the conflict between the Taliban and the government sees more and more violence and casualties\. In the first quarter of 2021 alone, there has been a 29 per cent increase in casualties than in 2020\. Since January this year, 270,000 civilians are estimated to have been displaced: the total number of displaced is currently 3\.5 million\. “Many have reported interruptions to social services and a loss of income due to rising insecurity,” UNHCR spokesperson Babar Baloch said\. Additionally, women and children are reported to be targeted in increasing numbers\.


> We urge the international community to step up support to the Government and people of Afghanistan and its neighbours at this critical moment, in a spirit of solidarity and burden\-sharing\. 





The UNHCR’s required budget for Afghanistan at the moment is only at 43 per cent of the 337 million dollars needed to offer full support\.

### Sea

More than 100 people in seven boats arrived today in Lampedusa, GDS [reports](https://agrigento.gds.it/articoli/cronaca/2021/07/13/migranti-7-sbarchi-a-lampedusa-in-poche-ore-104-tunisini-approdano-sullisola-7f04339b-5ed9-46bb-8ff6-7ee51591e1cb/?fbclid=IwAR01ItBm-xjLimix9HzoObVjrHUlXYSvIMgDQM6uKJSia4_X_mfifhCscUM) \. However, almost 900 people have died in the central Mediterranean this year, while civilian rescue ships are prevented from going on their missions\. Sea\-Watch has subsequently announced a protest for 7th August\. While Sea\-Watch’s ship the [Nadir](https://twitter.com/resqship/status/1414975158511620097?fbclid=IwAR3enfpx-J7KOEsm2zQm-7aTY0CRM2P0sHGCf1PjPvVuv98o5i1EfkYm5Yg) was able the leave the harbor for its second observing mission this year, repressive policies and government blocks mean that people are continuing to be left to die at sea\.

We must oppose the policy of letting people die: on August 7, we will take to the streets across Europe.

### Bosnia

Authorities in Bihac have evicted the old metal factory, forcing the people to be transferred to Lipa camp, No Name Kitchen notes\. “They went into every room and they threw out all the stuff — tents, sleeping bags, mattresses, clothes, pots”, one witness stated\. SOS Balkanroute [warns](https://www.facebook.com/SOSBalkanroute/posts/535076957931882) that many people will return and try to go to the “game” now, meaning that they will once again attempt dangerous crossings\.

> > New eviction today in Bihac to bring people to Lipa Camp. A camp where European Union is sending money. It is in a remote place. But it seems that the most important of this border strategy is to keep people hidden and make their life as difficult as posible. https://t.co/EvLYtLguYs

### Belgium

German newspaper Taz [reports](https://taz.de/Hungerstreik-in-Belgien/!5781092/) about the 475 people of the “sans\-papiers” group on hunger strike in Brussels\.

### France

BAAM criticizes the prefecture for not allowing the yearly migrant ball for safety reasons\. “It is a direct and unheard infringement of the right of an activist association to express political opinion,” the group stated\.

The Irish Refugee Council [calculated](https://irishrefugeecouncil.eu.rit.org.uk/Handlers/Download.ashx?IDMF=eb80e90b-dc4d-4da1-9d2b-76fba892ac63) the human cost of delays in the asylum system, which can be up to two years\. “ _Feelings of stress, frustration, wasting of skills, damage to families and even suicidal ideation were all evident in the responses to the survey we conducted\. Delays also undermine the integrity of the Irish protection process itself\. All stakeholders should be deeply concerned”,_ CEO Nick Henderson told [Statewatch](https://www.statewatch.org/news/2021/july/ireland-new-report-highlights-devastating-effects-of-delays-in-the-asylum-process/?fbclid=IwAR3B0CU6LjN9NTwrqSGj2VPEhQM15wqSr_M9_iVgylFRSRqX_1aIg3S84J4) \.
### Denmark

The Irish Syria Solidarity Movement published an open letter to the Danish government, protesting against the cancelled residencies and deportation plans for 191 Syrians\.

### Finland

Due to increasing safety concerns, Finland has decided to temporatily halt deporations to Afghanistan\. The immigration service did not give a time frame for the suspension, Reuters [reports](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/finland-halts-deportations-afghanistan-after-us-troops-leave-2021-07-12/?fbclid=IwAR3HG1_Fg1Myzp5ceS-f4NrjoFutp5_VipoRqRBdvWLmhfleMjXORjhdcPo) \. The country is unstable and the situation not clear, the office argued\. Therefore the situation for returnees could not be evaluated\.
### General

The Women’s Refugee Commission has [published](https://www.womensrefugeecommission.org/research-resources/supporting-young-male-refugees-and-migrants-who-are-survivors-or-at-risk-of-sexual-violence-a-field-guide-for-frontline-workers-in-europe/?fbclid=IwAR1DYr5GzDX0vhShEVR3b6MmrpX1vpRRYoH95D7oBRZTD28E6jtnFbescXw) a new field guide “ _Supporting Young Male Refugees and Migrants Who Are Survivors or At Risk of Sexual Violence”\._ It is made for frontline workers to integrate protection and support structures for this group\.
