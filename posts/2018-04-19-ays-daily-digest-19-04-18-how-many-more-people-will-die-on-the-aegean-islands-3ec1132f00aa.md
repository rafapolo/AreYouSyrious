Refugees look on as the Ventimiglia camp in Italy is destroyed \(Photo by [Holes in the Borders](https://www.facebook.com/RefugiadosenAtenas/?hc_ref=ART8J7jaO2nSwNe2T43VhVU6bQwA8z2rmSgvQBDM1y9b11xUKLEHo4f-p77CxZ4ZN5g&fref=nf) \)
### FEATURE: Afghani refugee dies on Lesvos

It has been confirmed today by Greek outlets and from medical volunteers working in the Moria camp that Ali Khoshe, an Afghani refugee who was taken to the hospital earlier this week, died there\. The cause of his death has been reported as chronic cardiac illness\. However, it has also been reported that his health was made worse by the unacceptable living conditions in the camp and his constant exposure to the elements\. Given the state of the Moria camp, this comes as no surprise\. As is the case with many refugees living on the Aegean islands, he did not get adequate medical care in time\.

A volunteer with the MMS medical team working in Moria confirmed that they examined the man and called an ambulance for him this past Sunday\. Following his hospitalization, a group of refugees moved to Mytilene, and camped out in the town there, demanding adequate medical treamtent and an end to their detention\.

The protestors have been there for three days now, and were today visited by the Mayor of Lesvos, Spyros Galinos\. [Galinos called](http://www.lesvosnews.net/articles/news-categories/koinonia/entasi-stin-plateia-sapfoys-pethane-afganos-prosfygas-sto) the refugees’ encampment a “provocative action” that undermined relations between refugees and the Greek residents of the island\. He demanded that the group leave immediately, and threateningly warned that their protest “risks triggering dangerous social reflexes\.”

The [Greek Forum of Refugees](https://www.facebook.com/Greekforumofrefugees/?hc_ref=ARScd24TvE_2Tb0Yy0H-uD6sjwvQRvQip90sMLW6Nn_dOFI8dYsvYvzKXPQVjpTZDwQ&fref=nf) issued a statement today in support of the demonstrators on Lesvos:


> The protests in Lesvos continue after the death of a man who didn’t receive the medical care he needed\. This tragic event is another display of the suffering on the islands and the urgency for transferring the vulnerable people to the mainland\. 





> After the statement of the Council of the State, we remind that there are thousands of people still trapped under these inhumane conditions and we demand the freedom of movement to the mainland\. 





> People trapped in the islands did nothing to be detained and forced to live in these appalling conditions\. People in Moria are dying because of it\. 






> We ask for the accountability of the authorities\. We ask for the right to a dignified life\. We ask for justice\.

They were trying to call attention to what is an invisible issue to many travellers — the harassment and arrest of refugees trying to reach France from Italy\.

As the group stated:


> A lot of these people don’t even get on that train\. Others are arrested because they are without documents\. At the departure of each train to Bardonecchia at least two cops will patrol the track accompanied by soldiers with machine guns, who almost always climb up and search wagon cars\. Every visibly black person traveling is asked for documents\. They often don’t even get a ticket\. It doesn’t matter\. If you’re black, they’ll ask you for documents, and if you don’t have them, you get thrown off the train\.

> Some 200 people were left last night sleeping on the banks of the river, the beaches, and the streets of the city\. 





> The volunteers present there claim that the red cross has said that it has sufficient capacity to welcome them all but is being managed very slowly despite the fact that the news of the eviction arrived during the afternoon of the day before yesterday\. \(Source: André Naddeo\)

#### Demonstration in Athens against the Moria 35 and Petrou 8 trials

[Solidarity Space City Plaza](https://www.facebook.com/sol2refugeesen/) announced a demonstration in Athens this Friday against the trials of the Moria 35 and Petrou 8, which are beginning that day on Chios\. Both cases involve the imprisonment of refugees for protesting and demanding their human rights\. The Moria 35 are a group of refugees from Lesvos who are being tried with “rioting” after a peaceful protest occured on the island\. From [City Plaza’s announcement](https://www.facebook.com/events/380571802422943/) :


> The senseless punishment of refugees by the Police and Judicial Authorities stem from the inhumanity of the “deterrence” policies, a central part of the racist EU\-Turkey deal\. In both cases, the Ministry of Citizen Protection is responsible for the abuse of desperate people who dared to ask for their human rights, and for their asylum cases to be sped up after an imprisonment of many months\. 





> We express our deep solidarity and demand the refugees’ acquittal\. 





The demonstration is happening on April 20th at noon, click [here](https://www.facebook.com/events/380571802422943/) for more information\.
#### NoBorders to organize solidarity demonstration

The [NoBorders](https://www.facebook.com/nobordersnetwork/) network announced a solidarity demonstration to occur outside the courthouse on Chios, more information [here](https://www.facebook.com/nobordersnetwork/photos/a.660787423989153.1073741828.657905327610696/1722251014509450/?type=3&theater) \.

The long\-time Athens volunteer [Sotiris Alexopoulos](https://www.facebook.com/sotiris.alexopoulos1?hc_ref=ARSoRJeyG20n5OuCuNyaGB9QX2-4WuEst9gr9xsX6EOUZwiP1yVzlmDjzlVS2atPEoM) described the increasingly dire situation for refugees in the city and the need for immediate housing options today:


> Along with Thessaloniki, the streets of Athens are overflowing with newly arrived refugees from Evros and the islands who are in vain looking for temporary shelter\. Camps are overcrowded and the squats — which usually solve the problem — have also overflowed and are looking for other unused large buildings\. \. 





> Is it time for the State to give up some of the many empty public buildings to those who have the possibility to run them as temporary shelter for refugees eg\. in Municipalities, Solidarity Structures, Voluntary Organizations, Associations, NGOs etc?

### BULGARIA

According to statistics released from the Eurostat agency today, over 90% of people who were granted asylum in Bulgaria were Syrian\. The country gave asylum to 1,530 Syrian people, 110 Iraqis, and 25 people who were categorized as stateless\. Last month AYS reported on the death of a Kurdish man with refugee status in the country, who died of exposure while living on the streets\. Clearly, having refugee status in Bulgaria does not mean one is living in safety\.
### FRANCE

The [Cuisine des migrants](https://www.facebook.com/lacuisinedesmigrant/?hc_ref=ARSHTV-BRpt7Pm19Ny05eGoSk7N4QQCYjZSTTBjzQlUeqsDzXpZ22woG3iryBsUTwBk&fref=nf) volunteer group reported another action taken by the Calais local government in to make the lives of refugees more miserable\. Shortly after erecting a number of stone barriers to prevent the distribution of aid in the area, local authorities saw fit to remove a bus shelter because refugees were seeking shelter under it\. A volunteer from [cuisine des migrants](https://www.facebook.com/lacuisinedesmigrant/?hc_ref=ARSHTV-BRpt7Pm19Ny05eGoSk7N4QQCYjZSTTBjzQlUeqsDzXpZ22woG3iryBsUTwBk&fref=nf) contacted the local operator of the bus to find out more, and only received evasive answers\. She then contacted the inter\-city authorities and the school bus service, who confirmed that the stop was removed because people were seeking shelter under it\.

Are the bus shelters of Calais only made for white citizens?
#### Utopia 56 releases call to action

The [Utopia 56](https://www.facebook.com/asso.utopia56/) volunteer group along with [L’Auberge des Migrants](https://www.facebook.com/AubergeMigrants/) put out a call to action for French citizens to resist the draconian new immigration laws\.

### AUSTRIA

The right\-wing Austrian ruling party proposed harsh new legislation this week that would make it harder for refugees to become citizens\. Among other measures, the proposed bill also allows for government theft of refugees’ money and the seizure of their phones\. While the seizure of refugees’ money and property has been previously documented in the country, it has not yet been policy\.

The idea that the government has the right to steal the possessions of outcast people has disturbing historical parallels\. It is shameful that a European government would propose a law like this in the 21st century\.

The [Refugees Welcome](https://www.facebook.com/plattform.refugees.welcome/?hc_ref=ARQuHFaav62E1sAKFNNPUldS-JXwQJYUSlrWY2yCHDHYqFR0Ibjjg-7Cqereeqk4hNM&fref=nf) platform released a statement on a forced deportation flight that took off from the Vienna airport this Thursday\.


> Charter deportation Vienna — Ghana/Nigeria/Gambia\! 





> On the 19th of April 2018, people shall be deported by FRONTEX charter flight from Vienna to Ghana, Nigeria and the Gambia\! 





> Vienna airport is an international turning point for charter flight deportations to many countries\. The rightwing extremist government is determined to defend Austria’s position as European “deportation champion” — a shameful and sad distinction\! 





> The deportation to three African countries at once is organised by the European border\- and deportation agency “FRONTEX”\. 





> African countries are put under massive pressure by EU\-states to collaborate with the deportation of their own citizens\. 





> It is high time to organise resistance against the inhumane and racist deportation business\! Stop the charters of shame\! 




### GERMANY

Approximately 200 people who are living in the Fürstenfeldbruck air base protested today agains the unacceptable conditions in the facility, and the cancellation of their cash cards\. Police have been conducting arrests in the facility on a regular basis to deport people, and many are living in constant fear\.
