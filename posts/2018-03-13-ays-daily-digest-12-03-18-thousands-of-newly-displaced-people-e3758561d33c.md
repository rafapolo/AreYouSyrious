### Syria

Hundreds of people recently fled the Turkish\-led advance on Afrin, a Kurdish hold enclave, AFP [reports](https://www.yahoo.com/news/hundreds-flee-turkish-advance-afrin-city-monitor-152347780.html) \(via Yahoo\) \. According the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, more than 2000 people have already in the area of Nabul, which is controlled by Syrian governmental forces\. Due to the number of people exiting the Afrin region, nearby areas opened schools and mosques to accomodate the new arrivals\. 16,000 internally displaced people are said to be in the area of Nabul and Zahra\.

Since the start of the operation, only one Convoy made its way to Afrin\. Reportedly, the Turkish forces have already captured 60 percent of the region\.

Even worse seems to be the situation in Douma, a city in the area of Eastern Ghouta\. Since the Syrian forces started capturing parts of the area and divided it, thousands of people have left their homes and went to Douma, which is still held by opposition forces\. The local council now highlighed, that Douma faces a catastrophe, the Middle East Monitor [reports](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20180312-syrias-douma-faces-catastrophe-local-council/) \. Thousands of families would have to sleep rough in the streets or public gardens\. Existing basements were overcrowded already\.

You can find the full report [here](http://www.asylumineurope.org/sites/default/files/report-download/aida_ro.pdf) \.
### Bosnia

The number of people who are entering Bosnia is still increasing\. None of the state agencies or big international agencies present in the country \(UNHCR and IOM\) are not giving any numbers of people who are currently in the country\. However, Border police issued a statement saying that since the beginning of this year, they discovered 639 people who entered the country\. At the same time, they prevented 661 person to enter the country over the green border\.

Only in January, 157 people wee discovered by border police, in February 315 and so far in March 167\. Most of the people are near the cities of Trebinje, Zvornik, Bratunac, Gacko, Velika Kladusa, Bihac and some in area of Brcko, Foca, Posusje, Capljina and Grude\.

Most of the people who are entering Bosnia now are from Syria, Pakistan, Lybia, Afghanistan, Palestine, Algeria, Iran, Marocco, Iraq, Turkey… Nevertheless, these are not complete figures and it is not possible to find this data\.

### Hungary

The election of populistic and right\-wing governments in Austria and \(probably\) Italy seem to strengthen Hungaries views on foreign politics\. “It is obvious that we will work together in the future,” foreign minister Peter Szijjarto [told](http://ewn.co.za/2018/03/12/hungary-seeks-broader-anti-migrant-alliance-after-austria-italy-elections) Reuters \(via Eyewitness news\), hoping that the Visegrad countries will strengthen their ties with Italy and Austria\.
### Croatia

Human Rights Watch [criticizes](https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/03/12/submission-human-rights-watch-united-nations-committee-rights-child-concerning) the low protection of unaccompanied minors in Croatia\. They would still “ face social isolation and difficulties in accessing language classes and education” and “ be placed in residential institutions for children without adequate arrangements for their protection and care”\. In the school year 2017/2018 only one out of 30 registered unaccompanied childred could attend classes\.

Until the EU countries speed up the resettlement from Niger’s capital Niamey, they do not want to transfer any new people from Libya\.

### Italy

Liberties [reports](https://www.liberties.eu/en/news/inhuman-conditions-in-the-lampedusa-hotspot/14526) , that human rights activists group found several human rights violations at the Lampedusa hotspot\. “Our delegation found that there are no canteens in the hotspot\. The food — to be eaten in the room or outside — is of very poor quality\. Squat toilets have no doors and mattresses are dirty,” stated Gennaro Santoro and Giulia Crescini\. They further witnessed difficulties in the application process and criticize, that the people neither get a residence permit nor can leave the island\. Some 180 people are hosted in the center, most of them single men\. Hence, the delegation also criticizes the inexistence of security staff, leaving voulnerable groups abandoned\.

In four days, there will me a debate in the parliament about family reunion to the UK\. “ The UK has some of the most restrictive laws on refugee family reunion in Europe\.
