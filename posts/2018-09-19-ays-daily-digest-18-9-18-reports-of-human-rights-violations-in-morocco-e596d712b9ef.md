### Reports of Human Rights violations in Morocco

Alarmphone is [recording](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1652972374920129/permalink/2089863161231046/) an increasing number of interceptions by the Moroccan Navy\.

Of the 17 boats, the volunteers suppported in the Western Mediterranean the last week, only two were rescued to Spain\. Moroccan forces intercepted 14 boats, and one returned independently, Alarmphone says\.

_‚ÄúThe many interceptions show that the crack\-down in Morocco on migrant travellers is not confined to the land, where thousands have been violently arrested and deported south over the past weeks\. Under European and Spanish pressure, Moroccan forces are trying to intercept and return as many people at sea as possible\.‚Äù_

This comes along with reports from [Association Marocaine des Droits Humains ‚Äî Section Nador](https://www.facebook.com/AmdhNador/photos/a.1693125780899690/2187766154768981/?type=3&theater) , that 150 people, including 35 women and seven children ‚Äî were arrested in Tangier, Morcco\.
### Turkey

On Monday evening, IOM Turkey stated that one female passenger was lost after a boat with 19 people capsized off Bodrum\. So far, two people are known to have died\. There has not been further update yet\.

### Sea

Today, Salvamento Maritimo [rescued](https://twitter.com/salvamentogob/status/1042099219715317761) 223 people from four boats\. 124 of them will be transferred to Mortil, 99 to Almeria\.

Meanwhile, three Members of the European Parliament [wrote](http://www.guengl.eu/uploads/news-documents/letter_PM_Muscat_SAR_boats.pdf) to Joseph Muscat, Prime Minister of Malta, and demanded that he release the Lifeline, Sea Watch and the Moonbird\. ‚ÄúIt is with great concern that we call on you, as Prime Minister, to end the unlawful detention in Malta of SAR boats and the Moonbird aircraft and give them clearance to leave the harbour\. **A humanitarian act such as rescue at sea is not a crime and should never be criminalised\.** ‚Äù

In addition, today the UNHCR [urged](https://twitter.com/Refugees/status/1042067019728932865) the ‚ÄúStates to take action to ensure boats carrying refugees and migrants rescued at sea have a safe place to dock\. **Saving lives at sea must be the top priority\!** ‚Äù

### Greece

With more than 17,000 residents and an official capacity of 6,400, the hotspots on most of Aegean Greek islands remain heavily overcrowded\. With around 4,000 people, the Samos hotspot is hosting more than six times its designed capacity, RSA [reminds](https://twitter.com/rspaegean/status/1042042730220806144?s=21) \. Furthermore, it has been reported that on Sunday, a migrant worker was attacked in in Asporpyrgos in West Attica\.

MSF adds that only in the first two weeks of September, more than 1,500 people arrived on Lesvos\. ‚Äú With no space left, they are sleeping without any shelter, without sufficient food and with extremely limited access to medical care\.‚Äù

At the same time, [New Europe](http://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2018/09/18/moria-relocation-migrants/) refers to a EU source saying that some 3,000 people will be allowed to leave Lesvos soon and will be transferred to the mainland\.

‚ÄúMore than 3,000 migrants whose geographic restrictions have been lifted are expected to leave the islands for the mainland ‚Äî the Commission is hoping to accelerate this process,‚Äù the source said\.

But if new arrivals continue apace, 3,000 will barely help to ease the situation on the island ‚Äî on Lesvos alone, 1763 people have been registered as new arrivals between the 1st and 17th September\. So far this year, around 3,300 more people have been registered in Lesvos than have been transferred to mainland\.

On the mainland, it is [reported](https://twitter.com/mariamjxde/status/1042061533621174272) that people have occupied the building of Solidarity Now in Larissa and are demanding the end of the Skype pre\-registration system, as well as highlighting other problems in the Greek asylum system\. For people who arrived in Greece by land, the only way to apply for asylum is to call a Skype hotline and ask for an appointment, or ‚Äúpre\-register\.‚Äù This hotline is hardly available and extremely difficult to access; it can take months to get through and book an appointment, especially for non\-Arabic speakers, who may only have one two\-hour slot per week in which they can call\. And for the period of weeks or months in which refugees are unable to get through to Skype, they are considered illegally present in Greece and cannot access key medical services or apply for official accommodation\.

The Foodkind team in Athens is asking for volunteers to help in the Oinofyta camp, some 60km north of Athens\. Most support is needed in the kitchen, but the activities also include games, sports and activities with children\. Housing is available\. For this as well as for transportation costs, the team asks for a small contribution from interested volunteers\. If you are interested, write an E\-Mail to action@foodKIND\.org\. The [Feox rescue team](https://www.facebook.com/1584119558539350/photos/a.1659925364292102/2217112328573400/?type=3) on Chios is asking for more people in October and November, too\.

Campfire Innovation is [extending an invite](https://www.facebook.com/events/507305026409303/) to a Smart Aid Gathering in Athens on Thursday, 27th September\. The participants will discuss how to provide dignified aid efficiently\. Hestia Hellas, I am you, and Solomon will be part of the panel\.
### Italy

In its weekly snapshot, the [UNHCR](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/documents/details/65775) recorded 616 new arrivals to Italy for the week ending on September 16th\. This is still far lower than one year before, when 2015 people arrived on Italian shores\. However, 400 of these arrivals are estimated to have arrived only in the last seven days\.
### Balkans

UNHCR and its partners gathered mounting reports of collective expulsions: 565 from Croatia \(up from 277 two weeks ago\), followed by 247 from BiH \(up from 147\), 28 from Hungary \(down from 49\), and 22 from Romania \(up from 20\) \. More than 58% of these reports alleged denial of access to asylum procedures by authorities of these neighbouring countries\.
### Austria

Activists in Salzburg are calling for international protests against the EU summit\. ‚ÄúAgainst the EU summit of isolation and social control,‚Äù they claim\. The protests are scheduled for 20th September, 2pm local time\. An exhibition and hearings are going to take place before\. You can find more info here: [https://summit\-salzburg\.mobi/en/](https://summit-salzburg.mobi/en/)
### France

La cuisine des migrants [is asking](https://www.facebook.com/CuisineDesMigrants/photos/a.1953857994628234/2645260485487978/?type=3&theater) for volunteers to help with distributions\. Interested persons can come directly to 73 rue Philippe de Girard Paris 18e until 2pm local time\.

### Sweden

The Afghanistan Migrants Advice & Support Org [has information](https://www.facebook.com/195295217167437/photos/a.1419588361404777/2125955330768073/?type=3&theater) that at least four people have been deported from Sweden to Kabul today\. The airplane is expected to arrive in the morning\. The team promised updates as soon as possible\.
### General

The IOM [reveals](http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/World/2018/Sep-14/463409-migrant-land-arrivals-in-europe-up-seven-fold-un.ashx) , that in one five asylum seekers ‚Äî 20 percent ‚Äî is coming to Europe by land\. In total around 18,000 people were counted, which is a seven\-fold increase compared to the same period in 2017\. The most frequented route is the one from Turkey to Greece, with 12,000 people making their journey this way\. Despite the fact that this is officially a land border, many of those people are crossing the Evros river\. It is also a dangerous route, which has taken several lives this year\. The river is especially treacherous during high water seasons\.

Most of the remaining 6,000 people entered Europe through Ceuta and Melilla, the two Spanish enclaves in Morocco\. ‚ÄúWe know that as soon as one route is blocked another one will open,‚Äù said the IOM mission chief in Turkey, Lado Gvilava\.

The most frequently used route is from Turkey to Greece https://t.co/AJGhzYxQzy
