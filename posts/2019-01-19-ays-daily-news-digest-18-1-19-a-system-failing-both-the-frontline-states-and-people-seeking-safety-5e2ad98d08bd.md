**_More women, men and children will suffer unless European governments agree on a swift and predictable disembarkation policy in line with international law and a fair system to share responsibility among EU countries\. —_** Matteo de Bellis, Amnesty International’s Migration Researcher

Under international law, people rescued at sea must be taken to a nearby place of safety, namely a country where they will be treated humanely and offered a genuine opportunity to seek asylum\. Avoiding legal and moral obligations, the EU states have continuously been giving the Libyan Coast Guard support to intercept people at sea and return them to Libya, where it is proven over and over again that they are subjected to arbitrary detention, and often torture\.

European leaders must urgently act to fix a system which deters states from assisting refugees and migrants in peril at sea, said Amnesty International in an analysis published today\. [**_Cut adrift in the Mediterranean_**](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2019/01/cut-adrift-in-the-med/) outlines how the outsourcing of European border control to the Libyan authorities, in combination with a system which fails to share responsibility for asylum\-seekers fairly across Europe, has created a situation where people are frequently stranded in the Mediterranean and SAR teams are prevented from acting in order to save lives\. The latest such example is the order issued by Spanish maritime authorities last week, preventing Proactiva Open Arms from rescuing people in the central Mediterranean\. The AI analysis also sets out steps to ensure situations like the stranding of the Sea\-Watch and Sea\-Eye rescue ships, and the blocking of Proactiva Open Arms, do not happen again\.

See their 2018 report [here\.](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur30/8906/2018/en/)


> “European leaders can no longer turn their backs on people stranded at sea and continue distorting the debate on migration for their own political gain\. They must urgently agree on a swift and predictable disembarkation policy in line with international law and on a fair system to share responsibility for asylum\-seekers among EU countries\.” 




#### LIBYA

There were 14 dead and 58 wounded people as battles continue on the outskirts of Tripoli in Libya\. In the conflict area Qasr Bin Gashir, citizens and refugees trapped in the detention centre must be transported securely while it is still possible\.

Since the beginning of the year a total of 25 people bodies have been found in the surrounding area\. It is impossible to know how many more are missing and have not been found\.

On Friday afternoon in the central Mediterranean, about 50 nautical miles off the North East of Tripoli, a maritime patrol plane spotted a raft sinking with about 20 people on board\. The crew of the plane, given the bad conditions, immediately launched SAR in the vicinity of the raft, which was continued by the Libyan teams with the support of Italian Navy\.

#### MOROCCO

The country stopped 89,000 people from illegally migrating in 2018, up 37 percent compared with the previous year, the interior ministry said on Thursday\.

About 80 percent of migrants intercepted in 2018 were foreigners; 29,715 were saved at sea while 5,608 reportedly decided for a voluntary return to their home countries, the Moroccan ministry said\.

However, the [Association Marocaine des Droits Humains — Section Nador](https://www.facebook.com/AmdhNador/?__tn__=%2CdkCH-R-R&eid=ARClX7jcfLUv6ft1v3l4NTK2wxWvfUlq4ooUer6w_BDDf53BlMLsRdJkI1iswhajE5lI_G8nZH9tRfq0&hc_ref=ARTxSwfLyCqgszzTuqtRoB3-TiIsYY56lVJhI2FjddcE041ILrFq-DMu9YV7VN1Dgtc&fref=nf&hc_location=group) warn that their statistics rely on the number of documented attempts of migration, which vary from person to person — on average, people make from 4 to 8 attempts per year\.

In a recent shipwreck off the coast of Nador, 53 people are missing, presumably with only 1 survivor\.


> 2,217 died while crossing the Mediterranean including 744 on the western route, in 2018, the IOM said\.

#### SEA

4216 migrants and refugees have entered Europe by sea through the first 16 days of the year, @UNmigration reports\.

That’s almost twice as many as during the same period in 2018 \(2,365\) \.
In the past 10 days, the number of those who lost lives at sea multiplied by 10, the [Salvamento Marítimo Humanitario](https://www.facebook.com/smhumanitario/?__tn__=%2CdkCH-R-R&eid=ARDuWi66A4OdZG6W2yJQHNxwnLcI7zOK0LdsoLu1wGzXuUoCkmx1te9OfFOG6mfX-SBMBeuG89tCG1gJ&hc_ref=ARRCZbezDPoVHWXNuE77BLl6lbzg8TjP7b72l0k1pX2Oqn5A1eIsQqkhYaPKIWIukf0&fref=nf&hc_location=group) says\.

At the same time, more and more SAR missions with professional teams on board are prevented from helping and saving the lives of people at sea\. These are people who had few options but to board boats that offered the hope of gaining international protection overseas\.

#### GREECE

Despite the cold weather and poor conditions at sea, an increasing number of refugees who left Turkey have reached Greece recently\. [Reportedly](https://harekact.bordermonitoring.eu/2019/01/17/refugee-arrivals-to-cyprus-and-evros-from-turkey/?fbclid=IwAR0ZfQpdohVfk9sgOWOUKf7ypPqYj7M80Uxf9v_ropSQe59lZr2-4XlXWmI) , there were also arrivals in Cyrpus and Evros\.

During the bad weather, with high winds, there were new arrivals of people in Katarraktis beach on the island of Chios, [Salvamento Marítimo Humanitario](https://www.facebook.com/smhumanitario/?__tn__=%2CdkCH-R-R&eid=ARAikANS490cu9lK4QwxqdbTl6E6Mg3RMoarDHhtY6MmNSKZbRJm2QGDCF7BvjCG1sqFPfqrayLc3sRK&hc_ref=ARR1PS4wNTHTS2aC7vGKBqSjXHZnxkc0H_W9PjI-vJYAtlySXZCoRzbAepfeW75hZv0&fref=nf&hc_location=group) team reports\.

48 people arrived in the first vessel: 5 minors, 26 women and 17 men, arriving from Congo, Cameroon, Mali, Algeria and Guinea\.

Later on, another group arrived on Karfas beach: 11 minors, 4 women and 7 men from Iraq and Palestine\.

4 people from Syria arrived with the third boat to Chios\.
One refugee missing from the morning arrival was found dead near Farmakonisi\. The remaining people were reportedly transferred to Leros\.

### New centres opening in Greece

Two new facilities are set to open soon in a bid to ease the pressure on the overcrowded refugee camps on the north eastern Aegean islands of Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Kos and Leros, InfoMigrants r [eports](http://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/14555/greece-will-open-new-migrant-reception-centers-on-the-mainland?platform=hootsuite) \. The two centers will open “within the coming weeks” in Vaiochori, near Thessaloniki in the north, and in Kypselochori, close to Larissa in the central Thessaly region, according to state sources\.
### Greece’s treatment of migrant children subject to legal challenge before the European Committee on Social Rights

A [**legal challenge**](https://rm.coe.int/cc173casedoc1-en/168090390c) to the violations of migrant children’s social rights on mainland Greece and its North Eastern Aegean islands has been lodged before a European body specialised in the protection of social rights at the European level\. The legal action, taken in the form of a collective complaint to the [**European Committee on Social Rights**](https://www.coe.int/en/web/turin-european-social-charter) by the [**European Council on Refugees and Exiles**](https://www.ecre.org/) \(ECRE\) and the [**International Commission of Jurists**](https://www.icj.org/) \(ICJ\), catalogues the numerous instances of Greece failing its child care and protection obligations towards migrant children by leaving them in conditions of squalor, insecurity and violence\.

### Afghan minors sentenced and sent to adult prison

A group of six Afghans, three of whom are minors, were caught hiding in a truck near the city of Bačka Palanka, in an attempt to cross the border with Croatia\. The police arrested them and, as they reportedly had no money to cover the fine of 10000 dinars, all of them ended up in a single cell in a prison in Novi Sad\.


> “The police denied them the right to free legal aid, right to a translator and the right to state their case on the alleged misdemeanor\. \(…\) None of the other procedures that would determine their age were done, after which the whole process wouldn’t have taken place at all\.” — _Nikola Kovačević, Belgrade Human Rights Centre_ 





One of the boys that the lawyers of the Belgrade Human Rights Centre managed to speak to, with the help of a translator, spoke to them in the prison, saying he only speaks Pashto and at no point could he understand what was happening\. However, the president of the court in Bačka Palanka said to the [media](http://rs.n1info.com/Vesti/a452768/Maloletni-migranti-iz-Avganistana-zavrsili-u-zatvoru-za-odrasle-u-Novom-Sadu.html?fbclid=IwAR01FT0GpnDVTJjfyxVP85zPpcvP4rNr3-a4s5MpJDPR5KPNGb1oIu4VeZY) that they had respected the law\.
#### BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
### Volunteer team of No Name Kitchen stopping activities due to pressure by the officials

The volunteers in Velika Kladuša have temporary been stopped from providing help to the refugees in the area, as some of them have overstayed their 90 days\. The group has been pressured by means of intimidation, restraint from providing activities and food, clothes and hygiene distribution\. Here is a part of what they posted on their official Facebook page:


> Today a volunteer was stopped and taken to the police station just for walking in the street\. Police officers visit the house where volunteers are staying at least once a week, but they have never been able to find anything with what they could charge us\. In one occasion, one of No Name Kitchen’s volunteer was followed home\. They were sure that he was a refugee, and he was held for a long time and asked to show his papers — all of which were in order\. They also visit the space for showers often, but they have not been able to bring anything against us, because we are actually doing nothing that goes against the rules\. We have always been kind to them and invited them to come see our work\. If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear\. 





> On their last visit to our working space they came together with IOM workers\. We were given an appointment to talk with the local authorities\. Because they have not been able to find anything dark behind our work, they now force us to have some document which entails this long procedure\. We are not even sure if there is any law regarding this document\. 





\(…\)


> Our lawyers are working right now to see how we can negotiate this new requirement or if it is actually legal at all\. They seem to be aiming at having people moving as little as possible from IOM’s camp, 5 km from Velika Kladusa; a camp which many of its residents have described as a “prison from which you can go in and out”\. We would certainly leave Velika Kladusa if IOM provided the services that refugees really need and deserve, but this is not the case and we are aware that we must stay\. We do not want to leave hundreds of people abandoned here\. 





> IOM’s camp is far beyond its capacity\. People are not provided with clean or warm clothes and there is no place where people can wash their clothes to prevent infections\. Many people come to us daily asking for clothes, wood to keep themselves warm, heaters, blankets, access to showers or hygienic products — and sometimes even food\.
