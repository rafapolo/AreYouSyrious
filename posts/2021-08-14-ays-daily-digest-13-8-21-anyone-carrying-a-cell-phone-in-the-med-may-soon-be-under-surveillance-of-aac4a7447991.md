### AYS Daily Digest 13/8/21: Anyone carrying a cell phone in the Med may soon be under surveillance by Frontex \(and the Libyan Coast Guard\)

#### FEATURE — Frontex accountability — implications for its legal responsibility for fundamental rights violations

The \(so called\) Libyan Coast Guard operates with valuable information that comes directly from the sky\. The unstoppable flow of data, images and coordinates entering the Eurosur Fusion Service platform, a system managed by Frontex, capable of generating intelligence reports, is now turned against humans\.


> Large companies specializing in intelligence have found a gold mine in the management of data to be provided to states committed to locking down borders, _Mediterranea writes\._ 





As we have been reporting, Frontex is extensively using the benefits of technological and AI developments for their securitisation that ultimately ends up with people losing lives at the EU borders and not that many solutions for a humane approach in sight\. The plan, as announced earlier, is the selling of data collected by spying from space\. Data would be sold not only to states, but also to private individuals if they are willing to pay\. It involves “the interception of radio waves emitted by maritime radars, Ais transponders, satellite phones and, potentially, of other assets, with geolocation of the equipment\.” Even though the Agency says it is only in a “pilot project” phase and that they “are not intercepting any communications,” the entire project is allegedly subject to secrecy constraints\.

**All devices that emit waves can be monitored\.**

As [Mediterranea team explains](https://mediterranearescue.org/en/news-en/this-is-how-frontex-will-monitor-migrants-from-space/?fbclid=IwAR1qTTD_m9ORq1P0A0eL8l1z5g2KzEKSqC8bkBWYMyfGihzTjcJTJmyClNQ) — aid for Libya’s efforts to push back migrants now comes directly from space\.

Meanwhile, in the other part of the Med, a balloon system equipped with cameras is now being tested at Alexandroupolis airport near the Greek\-Turkish land border in northeastern Greece and on the island of Limnos, with the aim of giving border officials a clearer view of approaching boats, media have [reported](https://www.ekathimerini.com/news/1166242/eu-border-agency-trials-high-tech-controls-as-afghan-fighting-spreads/?fbclid=IwAR0HXfG_Zevv3tCcicNnP_OCfU9KX3Edk-7VfA9C-w9ijKo8IqPCzO56eHY) \.


> The integrated mix of cameras and thermovision sensors with links to ship transponders and satellite communications gives officials a real\-time view of a 60 km \(40 miles\) circle of sea, covering 40,000 square km \(15,000 square miles\) \. 





At the same time, it has been confirmed that in the incident leading to the drowning of at least 130 people, which occurred on 21 and 22 April, operations were coordinated by a Frontex FASS airplane, the official answer of the EU Commissioner Ylva Johansson on behalf of the European Commission states\.


> The shipwreck in question occurred on 21–22 April 2021, the Libyan, Italian and Maltese Rescue Coordination Centres were informed by a European Border and Coast Guard Agency \(Frontex\) plane about a boat in distress and the Libyan Coast Guard assumed the coordination of the rescue operation and searched for it in the area of sighting, _the document reads:_ 






The Scrutiny Group has established that Frontex knew and ignored internal serious incident reports, repetitive opinions and recommendations of the Consultative Forum and the Fundamental Rights Officer, as well as publicly available information from credible sources\.


> Frontex has been aware of a violation or willfully ignored it, it may incur indirect responsibility for assisting in that violation by financial, operational and practical means or by failing to exercise its positive obligations to prevent it\.

Given all the developments regarding Frontex, it begs the question:

#### SEARCH AND RESCUE AT SEA

ResQ People witnessed an [interception by the Libyan Coast Guard](https://fb.watch/7mp6W-WoP6/) in the Maltese SAR area\.


> A Libyan Coast Guard patrol boat arrived on the scene and proceeded to intercept the boats, carrying approximately 40 people\. The master of the ResQ People radioed the Libyan patrol boat, pointing out that we were in the Maltese SAR area\. ResQ People had no choice but to witness and document this act\. 





The team departed from the port of Burriana on Saturday, August 7, for its first search and rescue mission in the central Mediterranean\. On board were 20 crew members from six countries\. They reported having rescued [85 people today](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fthecivilfleet.wordpress.com%2F2021%2F08%2F13%2F85-refugees-saved-a-day-after-rescuers-witness-an-illegal-pushback-in-maltas-waters%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1upK__qBupzkJKMjmhd5UlCELhc9vRm1GxftRlBXKgqv804HTlX9fUcsg&h=AT1xPBwtscIcOZuUJgbSbm8CzJaSr0x8Qj1J_ieq7afWRp5NTU_jXMgfl0wRHWjfZUnYFtiqfgJx9KqU_OLO2Vjq3ZPDEkA3rBZhKIC_ft7b6QmS_5PnZ0bhvF0_pkJFZEE__h5sSKhtjw&__tn__=R]-R&c[0]=AT19D8mYUMagG9qBZcYS4WTI7VGdL69Ta21NC7NYZ7ptltU796I2HsWD3v7IHdlvwPlXt8-a6bYD1S4Lmz5IHo8jTurjsIklmpook0LjhB5Hq9HwbTcAPozFzJuVijQV-Psl2TYDwKV9Sjhz6gxhPuMGpLb1YXcnOo6VxL0hgwa4HVy2CSopH1V-tJPmLkdIFUv3-n5eoEu1SGYIN1Y) \.

#### GREECE

_Recently, a man from the Amygdaleza detention center who was diagnosed with Covid\-19, was transferred back to the container he shares with others, as, as uniformed people who transported him stated, “there is no isolation in Amygdaleza”,_ Solomon reports\.


> Amygdaleza is one of the PROKEKA, in which people who are not recognized the right to stay in the country are placed in administrative detention, until they are deported, or more often receive a document calling them to leave Greece within a month\.

Project update ′′ portable showers ′′ in cooperation with Colletivo Sulla Rotta Balkanica — Alto Vicentino\.

The NNK team in BiH is now providing up to 30 showers a day using three portable showers and doing what they can at the moment to help those outside reception facilities receive showers and some friendly attention\.


> After the shower, each person receives a towel to dry himself and, in case they also need treatment to eliminate scabies, we provide them with specific soap, clean underwear and clothes\. 





> At the moment, it’s only possible to clean the towels every day to reuse them next time\. Unfortunately, we cannot take the clothes to the washing machine because the space is limited and, at the moment, we only count with one washing machine\. 





> For that reason, the shower\-backpack team with NNK health team have been working together to find industrial washing machines in [\#Bihac](https://web.facebook.com/hashtag/bihac?__eep__=6&__cft__[0]=AZVPCkl44xtK1GgAn-5UatQhsAPEu5mF1swaxVB5-Mmw5wNn5Illsjl3dlbV5_ZJakpQPRROmmPG4apWXJRj3-YG9hw961ntRdMGbXPniLpeSxLpu-U91_t25hf3IOMQ-5ACzSbfml7cZuGhY7RjYE1cqKuuEQokMPF_1ofxQYqJoMDYM_kOyk68c-p3lVtZlD78UVcNl_3bleQ0ctQMNBgG&__tn__=*NK-y-R) with the consent of using them to treat scabies\. In order to provide them with a short\-term solution, we give them soap to clean their clothes, to make sure the treatment is going to be effective\.

#### ETHIOPIA
### “I don’t know if they realized I was a person”: rape and sexual violence in the conflict in Tigray


> During the conflict that began on 4 November 2020 in Tigray — Ethiopia’s northernmost region — troops fighting in support of the federal government have committed widespread rape against ethnic Tigrayan women and girls\. The perpetrators include members of the Eritrean Defense Forces \(EDF\), the Ethiopian National Defense Force \(ENDF\), the Amhara Regional Police Special Forces \(ASF\), and Fano, an informal Amhara militia group\. Given the context, scale, and gravity of the sexual violence committed against women and girls in Tigray, the violations amount to war crimes and may amount to crimes against humanity\.
