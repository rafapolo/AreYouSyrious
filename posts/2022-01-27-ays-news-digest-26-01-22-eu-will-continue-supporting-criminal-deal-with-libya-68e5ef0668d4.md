#### LIBYA

**The European Union intends to continue building up Libya’s military capacity, so they could continue intercepting people on their way to a safer future\.**

The recently leaked report marked as confidential provides a rare insight into how the EU is nurturing a partnership with what is effectively a failed state, as it is [reported](https://www.forbes.com/sites/freylindsay/2022/01/26/the-eu-remains-positive-about-libyan-migration-cooperation-despite-horrific-human-rights-abuses/?fbclid=IwAR0hx84Rup6jfz-NjuOyPZYCFso3G489fIejqGeNNsnBE4oNA_6rrKvdUUU&sh=6b5c2d1a135c) \.

As we have been reporting, and as everyone knows by now, the EU is well aware of the force excessive to a criminal extent, shooting and violently attacking, that is used against people by the Libyan Coast Guard when intercepting boats\. It shows the clarity with which the EU is reconciling continued human rights abuses with the perceived political need to prevent people from reaching Europe’s shores\.

EU obviously consciously intends to continue to turn a blind eye to human rights abuses committed with EU funds and training, thinking they are bringing stability to Libya, paid in euros and human lives\.
### Refugees in Libya, a Manifesto


> We come from South Sudan, Sierra Leone, Chad, Uganda, Congo, Rwanda, Burundi, Somalia, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Sudan\. We are fleeing from civil wars, persecutions, climate changes and poverty back in our countries of origin\. We were all pushed by circumstances beyond human endurance\. 





The groups, [Refugees in Libya, have published a manifesto](https://www.refugeesinlibya.org/manifesto?fbclid=IwAR2CR5n4hcb8cGyWObTtZXpBEn-MSafmvbUEzJIeEmV_cfpnL6uv4iJPHWE) detailing their situation and demanding international support\. Both individuals and organisations can sign their petition to have their demands met\. They ask for:


> Evacuations to lands of safety where our rights will be protected and respected\. 





> Justice and equality among refugees and asylum seekers who are registered with the UNHCR in Libya\. 





> The abolishment of funding the Libyan coast guards who have constantly and forcibly intercepted refugees fleeing the Libyan hell and brought them to Libya where all atrocities befalls them\. 





> The closure of all detention centers across Libya, which are fully funded by the Italian and European union authorities\. 





> The authorities should bring the perpetrators to justice who have shot and killed our brothers and sisters both in and out of the detention centers\. 





> The Libyan authorities to stop arbitrarily detaining persons of concern to the office of UNHCR\. 





> To call on Libya to sign and ratify the constitution of the 1951 Genève Refugee convention\. 




#### MOROCCO
### 3 children died

AMDH reports that three Nigerian children have died in a fire at a makeshift shelter made out of plastic tarpaulin\. The incident happened near the northern African country’s border with the Spanish Melilla enclave\. More information is available in a [story](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/38141/three-migrant-children-die-in-tent-fire-in-morocco-ngo?fbclid=IwAR1JhjrQg7csvrpJZz_1WB2a_1Zn3mJyp3sJ05b2unWeLaTzOcvXhnarMLg) by InfoMigrants\.
#### SEA
### Criminalization of search and rescue

UN special rapporteur Mary Lawlorhrds has expressed her support to Sarah Mardini and Sean Binder\.

She expresses fear that Sarah & Seán’s lengthy pre\-trial detention \(107 days\), and the “pace” of the current investigations \(started in 2018\) “may deter others from carrying out legitimate human rights work until a verdict is reached”\. Ms Lawlorhrds found that the charges against Sarah and Sean “appear to conflate search and rescue operations with “facilitating irregular entry””\. She also notes that “there are currently no active search and rescue boats on Lesvos\.

[Amnesty International supports Sarah and Sean, urges Greece to drop the charges against them & stop all attempts to criminalize legitimate humanitarian activities and the work of NGOs assisting refugees and migrants\.](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FAmnestyEU%2Fstatus%2F1485935434039443459%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR3EElpXvFoHEaA8ZeH1JFAU6iUzCfAoB3SJTyRHZNJ7WphiOteyfaa7GAY&h=AT36OUQiM3nPbHU-sJOe6LKgzXMJcIhQzo177ZyY1Go0NrS-XerOnxb8fLW3_QFo50XOl8VKbiGJD46VLdSuC5a36OAptEZz2Jp0QFsMH-A1KcI4pTFfFT1M8BksvLy2r8-TjNtqttZ9eMt0kxqebAe31hfacg&__tn__=R]-R&c[0]=AT3_HHV2SjEtBfQfJBu4-CVdeKe3UdjbpQc9mxQAFA9jvdkDwo9v04hz0sCY3Xw20IEfHV58mS9TuCnTzgfaDSyjKmrkgTfyvP_W2rrYX_B8ssreCxyQWaN_jU_8xStvc4o1FbQMNodoPmz_Qx7_wJNl2bDkbyYZJbztHeKt7OWUrvHsWynWidKMuRP8nB1azwNX5knavvLGu-osZC8)
#### GREECE
### Samos Volunteers report on the hardships of people in new camp:


> It is incredibly cold in Samos this week\. The temperature has dropped significantly over the last couple of days\. 





> People who have received rejections to their asylum claim or are no longer ‘in’ the asylum system have their asylum applicant cards taken away from them — meaning that they aren’t able to scan their cards to operate the turnstile gates to enter or exit the camp\. 





> Whilst the authorities have said that people are allowed to leave on their own accord, the consequence would be that such individuals would not be allowed to re\-enter the camp — meaning that most people can’t leave the camp and regularly refer to the space as a prison\. 





> However, some people who have decided to leave the CCAC are now experiencing homelessness\. With the temperatures dropping below freezing, we have decided to re\-open for the second year in a row to offer an emergency shelter for people who may need a warm place to sleep\. 





> NGOs are working together to provide support — distributing blankets and hot water bottles to those living in the camp as well as those experiencing homelessness or who are living in houses in Vathy town without proper heating\. 






> Grassroots NGOs in Samos are once again stepping in to cover the immediate needs during this harsh cold weather\. Winter comes around every year — warmth and safety should be ensured for people claiming asylum in Greece during these cold months\. 




It is reported that once again at least **5 individual are being accused as “boat drivers” for the 4 shipwrecks of Christmas\.**

We demand the immediate release of all imprisoned survivors and an immediate stop of the criminal persecution\!”

It is important to remind of the case from December last year, when a man who had been imprisoned by Greek authorities for 416 days following smuggling accusations was awarded damages from the Greek state\.
He was acquitted of smuggling charges this April by a court on Chios after spending 416 days in pre\-trial detention\. In October last year, he sued for damages — and won\.
### People remain hungry in Greek camps

The power \(and hunger\) games between the international organisations and state authorities in the Balkans continue\. Among other accusations regarding the treatment of people across Greece \( [freezing](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.infomigrants.net%2Fen%2Fpost%2F38150%2Fgreek-system-leaves-migrants-out-in-the-cold%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR3AHagondYR-UBDN6o5Kfm3rNqUyBemEFotvvx_GxYDvrY1VL8-hMaskgY&h=AT2bzzJxFO4diyWXFp-VmbFnFvYT2_DL0p0uRPsAJkVKJB4Tzo6yjqs3IIBSO4980CP2N83jxnSyDgcDKA0PWSzGhNlEluRnW6-Bv-ZUBpdzOBIzFhz_5SlWqV8LK0iRJEWIJvQ_iAvd6dYMxOlQ3LrvIHL-cw&__tn__=R]-R&c[0]=AT3_HHV2SjEtBfQfJBu4-CVdeKe3UdjbpQc9mxQAFA9jvdkDwo9v04hz0sCY3Xw20IEfHV58mS9TuCnTzgfaDSyjKmrkgTfyvP_W2rrYX_B8ssreCxyQWaN_jU_8xStvc4o1FbQMNodoPmz_Qx7_wJNl2bDkbyYZJbztHeKt7OWUrvHsWynWidKMuRP8nB1azwNX5knavvLGu-osZC8) in poor conditions etc\. \), the latest in line of accusations aimed at the Greek state comes from the organisations [claiming](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/38096/greece-aid-group-warns-of-hunger-crisis-in-migrant-camps?ref=tw&fbclid=IwAR1c300d8WVIYubxv3zb2kJQQLPQRJVq7CZ6Hy54pwuw4s-6F4JZ7k5QeSc) people are being left hungry\.

The IRC explains that this is because “under a [policy implemented last October](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/35892/refugees-and-migrants-in-greece-left-hungry-ngos-claim) , when responsibility for cash assistance to the migrants passed from the UN refugee agency UNHCR to the Greek government, food is only being provided for those who are yet to receive a final asylum decision — around 10,200 people\.”

Among the rest are thousands of vulnerable people, many of them children, who are suffering without adequate food, they reported\.
#### SERBIA
### Extradition in spite the ECHR injunction

Serbian authorities have extradited a Bahraini dissident in cooperation with Interpol despite an injunction by the [European court of human rights](https://www.theguardian.com/law/european-court-of-human-rights?fbclid=IwAR1ztrnYCyzesxRjHeUiYYz5U62vAafEpmagpmZn4-cPgeBIFBaagZ4ToZM) , in the first test for the international policing organisation under the presidency of a top Emirati security official\. Although the ECHR had issued an injunction saying the extradition should be postponed until after 25 February to allow Serbian authorities time to provide more information to the court, which was responding to a request by the Belgrade Centre for Human Rights to consider Ali’s case, the Serbian authorities approved the extradition\.

#### CROATIA
### Croatian Ministry of Interior receives Black Book of Pushbacks

AYS has hosted delegation of the MEP Cornelia Ernst during her visit in Croatia last week\. But, so has the Ministry of interior, namely the Minister himself, along with the head of the border police and the State Secretary Terezija Gras\.

■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 


Ms Ernst visited all important sites and stake holders, spoke to people on the move, organisations and individuals invested in protecting their rights, and during her visit both in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Croatia, she once again witnessed evidence and confirmation of the abuse at the borders and lack of respect for the rights of people on the move\. She expressed worries over the poorly designed \(so called\) independent border monitoring mechanism and over pressures on human rights defenders\.
#### GERMANY
### New Deportation Centre Planned and Actions Against it


![](assets/68e5ef0668d4/1*lUpDcHWoBXH5mThqdtzwfA.jpeg)


The Ministry of the Interior of Brandenburg have announced a so called “entry and exit centre at BER airport” in Schönefeld to be completed by 2025\.


> The construction on an area of 4 hectares is planned to start this year and will comprise buildings for arrival, transit, custody and deportation\. So far, the planning process was highly intransparent and undemocratic\. 




#### FRANCE
### Video of Eviction

On the morning of the 25th another eviction took place in Calais\. Tents, tarps, sleeping bags and blankets were seized, even though the weather was freezing\.
