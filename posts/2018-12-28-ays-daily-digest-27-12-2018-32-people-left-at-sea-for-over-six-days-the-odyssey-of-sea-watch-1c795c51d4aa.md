### FEATURE

Since Saturday, [Sea\-Watch has been stranded at sea](http://www.redattoresociale.it/Notiziario/Articolo/613199/Migranti-l-odissea-di-Sea-Watch-Da-6-giorni-in-mare-chiediamo-porto-sicuro) , without a safe port to disembark the 32 people on board, among them four women, four unaccompanied minors, and three children\. Conditions at sea are becoming more and more harsh, and people are starting to suffer from the deprivation of a week at sea\.

Five countries: Italy, Malta, Spain, Germany, and the Netherlands refused to allow the vessel to disembark in their territories, pushing Phillip Hahn, head of the mission, to call out to Germany and Europe to take on their responsibilities and “show the good example\.” Specifically, the NGO is pressuring Minister of Interior, Horst Seehofer, to “use” section 23 of the [Residence Act](https://germanlawarchive.iuscomp.org/?p=281) regulation to offer all those fleeing from Libya a secure permit to stay, in compliance with human dignity and the supposedly widely accepted European values\.


> “The supreme Land authority may order a residence permit to be granted to foreigners from specific states or to certain groups of foreigners defined by other means, in accordance with international law, on humanitarian grounds or in order to uphold the political interests of the Federal Republic of Germany”\. \(section 23, Residence Act\) 





More than 30 cities in Germany have stated that they are willing to welcome the people on board of the Sea\-Watch vessel\.


> “On Christmas, it is striking how the European countries lack any sort of humanity \[…\] \. We, nevertheless, celebrated Christmas with people from 17 different nationalities and 3 different religions on board\. Our Christmas gift to them was informing their relatives, one by one, that their beloved ones are still alive\. We protect people, what do our governments protect?” says Giorgia Linardi, spokesperson for Sea Watch in Italy\. 





Meanwhile, after a call of distress this morning, Sea\-Watch had to head south, towards Libya, to support SAR operations\. This is how the news was welcomed by people on board after a week at sea\.
