#### Featured — Spanish supreme court ruled against geographic restrictions in Ceuta and Melilla

Today the Spanish supreme court [recognised](https://www.cear.es/el-tribunal-supremo-reconoce-la-libre-circulacion-a-los-solicitantes-de-asilo-de-ceuta-y-melilla/?fbclid=IwAR2iZS8vdB9KMC2_EPkl-6FaVMZ_DZrnqxmuOIYR8YkY039FYfj4xJABu6g) **the right of asylum seekers in the autonomous city of Ceuta and Melilla to free movement** **throughout the national territory\.**

■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 


In the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta, geographical restrictions were imposed to people applying for asylum\. This has been common practice for the last 30 years\. People applying for asylum in such territories were forced to remain there until the decision on their application\. CEAR had already obtained an estimative judgement by the Superior Court of Justice of Madrid about the illegality of retaining asylum seekers in both autonomous cities, against which state prosecutors appealed\. [Today’s judgement](https://www.cear.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sentencia_libertad_circulaci%C3%B3n_solicitantes_asilo_Ceuta_Melilla.pdf) by the Supreme Court confirms that the practice, maintained by the Ministry of the Interior, is not legal\.

SEA
#### Central Mediterranean — 84 people rescued by Italian supply ship and many more still at sea


■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 
> **[Alarm Phone](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone) @ Twitter Says:** 

> > In the last 24h we assisted in 5 distress cases: 

🔺17 people still in Libyan SAR since 2 days
🔺61 people still in Italian SAR
🔸33 people rescued to Malta last night
🔸85 people rescued to Italy last night
🔹85 people, fate unclear but hopefully rescued by #Asso29 

> **Tweeted at [2020-07-29 15:30:33](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1288497144840818689).** 

■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 


Of these five cases, the 61 people in Italian SAR have been rescued by the Coast Guard and taken to Lampedusa\. The 17 people in the Libyan SAR zone are instead still at sea, with no rescue in sight\. Alarm Phone report that Italian authorities told them to call the Libyan Coast Guard, which is currently failing to answer the phone…

Supply vessel Asso29, operating for an ENI platform off the Libyan coast, [rescued](https://twitter.com/saracreta/status/1288447136049385472) 84 people \(including six women and two children\), in an operation coordinated by the Italian Coast Guard, who suddenly woke up after months of radio silence\. Asso29 will [take](https://twitter.com/saracreta/status/1288447136049385472) the people rescued to Pozzallo, Sicily\.

The Italian Coast Guard was quick to publish a self\-congratulatory statement blaming Maltese and Gibraltar authorities for refusing to intervene\. As Giulia Tranchina [writes](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157902643843621&set=a.10150438475713621) , what Italian authorities are trying to describe as generosity is a **legal** **duty** that should be complied with for all boats leaving Libya\.

Such propaganda statements are sadly quite common\. On Monday, US authorities published a similar [statement](https://www.africom.mil/pressrelease/33046/us-assists-in-rescuing-migrants-stranded-in-m) , praising one of their vessels in the Central Mediterranean for the support given to the Libyan ‘coast guard’ in returning people to Tripoli in occasion of a distress call received on 21 July…

GREECE
#### On pushbacks and fake news

Yesterday we reported about a video published by AA, the Turkish state news agency, allegedly showing FRONTEX cooperating with the Greek coast guard to push back a boat that was trying to reach Greece\.

As Aegean Boat Report [commented](https://www.facebook.com/AegeanBoatReport/posts/885216328668139) : “The video would have been shocking, if it hadn’t been for the fact that the video is fake\.”

“This video is constructed from 15 different cases, some going back at least six months\. These 15 cases by themselves are actually real, but put together, claiming to be from 8 June, can’t be seen as anything else than Turkish propaganda\.”

States, all states, keep playing their political games, over the lives of people on the move\. A video like this risks to hinder the work of activists and organisations who spent years documenting pushbacks and border violence\. We reported in the past about instances in which the involvement of Frontex in pushbacks is something more than allegations\. Recently, we reported about t [he aerial support given by the European border agency to both the Libyan Coast Guard and the Croatian border police](ays-weekend-digest-25-26-7-2020-frontex-support-push-backs-at-sea-and-at-land-borders-6cb36fc8613e) \.
#### Enhanced ‘voluntary’ returns program launched

The Greek government [launched](https://www.facebook.com/migrationgovgr.info/photos/a.578873295600113/1687041238116641) AVRR, the enhanced assisted voluntary returns programme, for people on the islands of Leros, Samos, Lesvos, Kos and Chios who entered Greece before 31 December 2019\. Talking about voluntary returns in the context of the Greek eastern islands means trying to hide the very role of hotspots in such islands, their conditions, geographic restrictions, daily humiliations and abuses\. The European migration system is based on the constant reminder that people seeking asylum are not welcome and the inhumane conditions of the overcrowded hotspots on those islands — now in lockdown since April — are one of the clearest examples\.

These program is aimed at the nationals of countries NOT included on the list of safe countries of origin published by Greek authorities \(Republic of Ghana, Senegal, Togo, Republic of The Gambia, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Albania, Georgia, Ukraine, India, Armenia\) \.

According to media [outlets](https://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2020/07/29/news/lampedusa_quattordici_sbarchi_nella_notte_nell_hotspot_oltre_mille_persone_e_c_e_anche_un_positivo-263151820/) , 14 boats arrived last night in Lampedusa, carrying a total of 334, bringing the number of people on the move on the island to 1,100\. The island’s hotspot has a capacity for 95 people\.
#### Protests in Rome

#### New sea rescue NGO founded in Milan

ResQ — People Saving People was [presented](https://www.avvenire.it/attualita/pagine/migranti-nave-di-soccorso-in-mare-con-crowdfunding-resq-colombo) on Tuesday at a press conference\. The group is fundraising to ensure the presence of a new ship in the Central Mediterranean to rescue shipwrecked people and to document incidents, in compliance with non\-negotiable humanitarian principles of impartiality, neutrality, humanity and independence\.

The project consists mainly of two activities: one at sea and one on land\.

The activity at sea is carried out by a team of professionals and volunteers who rescue and collect testimonies of what is happening a few miles off our coasts\. “This will be possible thanks to a ship about 40 meters in length with a crew of ten people on duty and nine other people, among them doctors and paramedics, rescue workers, mediators, journalists and photographers\. Two fast inflatables, on the other hand, will ensure the approach to the boats in trouble and the rescue of passengers\.”

The activity on land will be to inform public opinion and “create a more conscious society that respects human rights and is ready for reception\.”

> These men, many of whom have spent months in Velika Kladusa \(the city where No Name Kitchen works\), in terrible conditions and suffering violence from police in every attempt to get to the European Union to seek asylum \(and after a long journey that sometimes lasts a year\), have arrived in Slovenia only to face more threats of push\-backs and arbitrary selection processes\. 





> They are protesting the news that they will be returned to Croatia in the next days and they asked for our help in sharing this news\. 





The protest is happening at a moment when more light has been shone on the refusal of Slovenian authorities to let people apply for asylum and on chain push\-backs from Slovenia to Bosnia\.

GERMANY
#### Federal Interior Minister Seehofer halts the Berlin state plan of welcoming refugees from Greece

Media [outlets](https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/brief-an-innensenator-geisel-seehofer-verbietet-berlin-die-aufnahme-von-fluechtlingen/26048558.html?) report that federal interior minister Horst Seehofer officially prohibited the state of Berlin from accepting other refugees\.

Following a long\-lasting campaign, Berlin state authorities had announced their intention to welcome 300 people on the move from Greece\. Berlin was not alone in this, as another 75 cities and German states had stated their willingness\. Seehofer has always been opposed to such plans, and has now officially halted them\. It is reported that members of the Berlin parliament are seeking legal advice to appeal this decision\.
#### SARAH — Search and Rescue for All Humans

Sarah, a new search and rescue NGO, was funded in March, with the aim of acquiring a 24m long vessel for SAR activities in the Mediterranean by March 2021\. They are fundraising to achieve this goal, and if they won’t be able to crowdfund enough money, the whole amount raised will be transferred to organisations already active in sea rescue\.

Further information can be found at [www\.sarah\-seenotrettung\.org\.](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sarah-seenotrettung.org%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2yRQBddthJcspj-Iw4c-GzHk_eZMdJL5I3_XEa3UCfv_x_P4yjRdfaC7k&h=AT3HOn_fcxBkAx_iC5z-ndZKNcVyIvDDqefKraWTdrgWYQZozPA_nrUqJJNaaZSlJsq0IcAkDpC0aMwIcmoGnIm33EFlQvh-gphnUzK116tYgjRCEuSLBkeqwjYtNvoM7buewms&__tn__=R]-R&c[0]=AT2nOrLboswDwv-V6B6aBTAVc4ziIbym091RBLwEYymaM3ttGMNezhDZsXzMR2v6kxwVZQWU4GhvKEZMRezRWgd_H8KABK0Hv5EGnvqWzPfWyXM5vI_imMJGog8WtIUdZbBrLZtPSu6f1MN-Y3NFWRyl4pW60aw8t1eAELwbUOwijCxOqb7ylx4Dm24XpW5FUmjFL4BUNeICsXc3qT5c9fT0U6GGDzlIXIp7wZu_NQedoKi6EdmkNtTKXu0dCgw)

FRANCE
#### Evictions in Paris

A large encampment in the area of the Saint Denis \(Paris Aubervillers\) was evicted by police on Wednesday morning\. Media report that 1,250 people were living in the area, while activist groups report that the camp was housing up to 1,800\.

Volunteers from Migrants Solidarite Wilson and other groups [were onsite](https://www.facebook.com/Solidarit%C3%A9-migrants-Wilson-598228360377940/) during the eviction and report that people were taken in buses to temporary shelters in the Paris region\. While authorities [stated](https://www.dw.com/en/france-police-dismantle-migrant-camp-in-paris-suburb/a-54366056) they would test all the evicted people for COVID\-19, MSW volunteers observed how some people were again on the streets only a few hours after the eviction\.

One more eviction in planned for tomorrow, 30 Thursday, of a camp that has been housing around 100 minors since 29 June\.
