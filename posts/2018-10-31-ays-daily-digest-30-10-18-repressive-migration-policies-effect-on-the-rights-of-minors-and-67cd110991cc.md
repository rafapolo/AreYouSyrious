#### FEATURE

The INTERSOS team has compiled a report on the state of the protection of unaccompanied foreign minors in Italy and Europe, basing the text on the Statistical Dossier of Immigration\.

The repressive policies adopted by the Italian authorities, by the other European States and by the European Union, have entailed very serious violations of human rights norms, including the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the European Convention on the Rights of the Man and the Geneva Convention, as well as international law of the sea\.

**In 2017, these serious violations of children‚Äôs rights were brought to the attention of the European Court of Human Rights, which adopted several provisional measures to protect some unaccompanied minors placed by Italian authorities in adult shelters\.**

26% fewer unaccompanied foreign minors were present in Italy than in the same period of the previous year, as was documented on 30 June this year\.

4677unaccompanied minors, mostly Eritreans, Somalis and Afghans, were untraceable, i\.e\. they had moved away from the reception facilities where they had been placed\. A significant proportion of minors who leave the reception centers do so with the hope of reaching Germany, England, Sweden or other European countries, where they have relatives or where they hope to find better prospects for integration\.


> These boys and girls try to cross the borders with France, Switzerland or Austria, alone or relying on traffickers, sometimes risking their own lives: some minors were killed, crushed by a tug or a train, while others have been found semi\-frozen\. 




According to this report, many of these young people find themselves living in makeshift accommodations in border towns and cities, without access to drinking water and sanitation facilities, in conditions of extreme degradation and exposed to serious risks of trafficking, abuse and exploitation\.
Many attempting to irregularly cross internal borders would have the right to be reunited with their relatives, but do not receive adequate information on family reunification procedures, also because the operators of the reception facilities, social services and police stations often do not have the necessary skills\. Even when they do know, faced with the prospect that the procedure may last more than a year, most children decide to reach relatives by their own means\.

In Italy, minors should remain for a very short time in the first reception government centers before being transferred to the SPRAR\. Moreover, the first or second reception facilities managed by the municipalities and the prefectures should be a temporary back\-up solution\. However, the reality is very different\. Please find a detailed analysis [here](https://www.intersos.org/msna-italia-tutela-dei-diritti-dei-minori-politiche-migratorie-repressive/?fbclid=IwAR3Rm_3HiRMASm4QovusXeWNFurT2VAHO1__eY3DVEaKXejuyhNsn3D5UW8) \.

If the Territorial Commissions for the recognition of international protection conform to the recent indications of the Minister of the Interior regarding the need to limit the recognition of humanitarian protection, this will probably result in an increase in the number of boys and girls who will be deprived of permission to stay and therefore marginalized and unable to make a positive path of social inclusion in Italy\.

### Athens

Iranian political refugees today held a protest at Syntagma Square in Athens, asking for asylum rights\.
#### BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
### Sarajevo

AYS is receiving reports about the confusing situation in Sarajevo\. People who are arriving are being sent to Delijas, an asylum center in the Trnovo suburbs of Sarajevo\. The center is far away, with no internet, phone connection, or transportation to and fro\. It is in the middle of the mountain, in the forest, and the first gas station where people can access internet and buy something is more than 10 km away\. However, some people were taken up there by the police, only to discover that the center is full \(it has a capacity of about 160\) ‚Äî whereupon the police left them there in the front of the center, forcing them to walk back to Sarajevo alone\. In addition, when they finally reached the city center, the police stopped some people from trying to give them food\. Additionally, according to these statements, police allegedly kicked them several times and one of them even told one of the boys: ‚ÄúGo back to your country\.‚Äù In the end, they were left to sleep on the street where they have now been for days, hiding from the police\. This is not an isolated case\. 
Meanwhile, the police continues to racially profile and harass refugees and prevent them from boarding busses going to the north of the country\.

The team distributing meals writes: ‚ÄúSarajevo was calm tonight and today\. No police presence during evening distribution, the weather is getting colder again ‚Äî fleece blankets and plastic for underneath was distributed\. Some groups of newly arrived people came\. \(‚Ä¶\) The camp has had trouble with both electricity and water, just as the whole town of Had≈æiƒái ‚Äî due to less rain than usual the levels of water are low\. Tanks with water were transferred there yesterday at least\.‚Äù
### Velika Kladu≈°a

Maljevac, the border crossing with Croatia, remained closed for the 8th day since the protest and provisional campsite being installed at the border area, until Tuesday afternoon\. 
In the meantime, local businesspeople met with the regional government to propose to host the camp inside of one of the old factories there, which belongs to a local businessman\.

Bearing in mind the context and difficulties people are experiencing, solely insisting on the opening of the borders in order for refugees to pass freely in the border area between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina will most likely not bring about a satisfying solution\. Instead, we encourage fellow volunteers and activists, along with helping where they can, to put pressure on their local, national and EP representatives, in order to raise the issue of where closed borders policy comes from in the first place\.
#### HUNGARY
### Supreme Court frees L√°szlo

The Supreme Court of Hungary has announced this Monday that they have acquitted camerawoman Petra L√°zlo from the October 2017 sentence that condemned her to 3 years of probation for disorderly conduct\. She was filmed kicking and trying to trip migrants, specifically one Syrian refugee and his child, while she was on the ground reporting on refugees fleeing from Serbia through Hungary in 2015\.
The Court said she should have been charged with a misdemeanor instead of a criminal offense\. It said the case had to be terminated now since the statute of limitations had expired\.
#### LIBYA
### Urging the EU to change policies and give priority to rescue operations in the Mediterranean

The reduction of rescue interventions carried out in the context of European operations and the obstacles placed on the ships of NGOs involved in rescues have led to an increase in the number of fatalities for people attempting to cross the Mediterranean or returned to Libya by the Libyan Coast Guard\. People are regularly arbitrarily detained in prisons, faced with inhumane conditions \(overcrowding, lack of food, water, medical care etc\. \) and subject to torture, rape and systematic violence\.

DRC has l [aunched an appeal](http://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/12961/eu-libya-cooperation-shipwrecked-values-of-humanity-ngo) to request an urgent change in the European Union‚Äôs external cooperation policies on migration in the central Mediterranean, stressing that the cooperation between the EU and Libya has led to a ‚Äúshipwreck of human values\.‚Äù

More evidence and testimonies arrive daily from those who are suffering because of the systems in policies in place\.


> Messages today from a Somali in Tripoli talking about the horrible circle he‚Äôs found himself in: escape a detention centre; try to get to sea; get caught by Libyan coastguard; get put in a detention centre; sold by owners to smugglers; made to pay to go to sea; caught again‚Ä¶ _‚Äî Sally Hayden [reports](https://twitter.com/sallyhayd/status/1057202979097452544) on Twitter about the recent messages and information received on the situation in detention centre in Libya:_ 





> I‚Äôve also been told there are three toilets for roughly 800‚Äì1,000 people in Zintan detention centre ‚Äî one of the reasons the conditions are so poor & people‚Äôs health is suffering\.
 

> From this perspective it means the smugglers are making extra by charging the same people multiple times to try & cross the Med\. A very few are still making it, leaving a glimmer of hope ‚Äî e\.g\. one man from Abu Salim DC recently escaped & made it to Italy\. Detainees were begging to be registered because they want legal paths to safety & a way out of this cycle of abuse & exploitation, but over the past few weeks, as they‚Äôve been told evacuation is incredibly unlikely, they‚Äôre again considering other options\.

### Most dramatic move yet in Trump‚Äôs hard\-line immigration campaign

The United States has been systematically closing the door on what has been one of the founding elements of the country ‚Äî migration\. 
President Trump is now trying to do away with birthright citizenship, falsely claiming that the U\.S\. is the only country with such a right, when there are more than 30 others\. As he said in an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0d21nQBY8o) on Monday, he plans to sign an executive order that would remove the right to citizenship for babies of non\-citizens and unauthorized immigrants born on U\.S\. soil\.
Sen\. Lindsey Graham later referred to birthright citizenship as a ‚Äúpolicy‚Äù when in fact it is enshrined in the constitution\.
