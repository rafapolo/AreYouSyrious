A group of researchers and journalists have been able to prove that [Greek police utilise people\-on\-the\-move to perform pushbacks](https://twitter.com/g_christides/status/1541668462195605504?fbclid=IwAR1MfLaxU_J6ITwTjMf0IyllUyQtPyjYW8A2RYV1fb_wVL-8hYju6HLs3pw) against other people attempting to cross the border between Turkey and Greece\. Using testimonies, police records and satellite data, the group were able to find evidence that the people assisting the police gain temporary papers in return for conducting pushbacks\. Referred to by local people as “police\-helpers”, the practice exploits those in a vulnerable position and is a tactic employed so that Greek police are less likely to encounter Turkish police, army or smugglers\.

The work is a joint project between [“Le Monde”](https://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2022/06/28/a-la-frontiere-avec-la-turquie-des-migrants-enroles-de-force-par-la-police-grecque-pour-refouler-d-autres-migrants_6132286_3210.html) and “Lighthouse Reports”, [“Der Spiegel”,](https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/pushbacks-an-der-eu-grenze-wie-griechenlands-polizei-gefluechtete-fuer-verbrechen-einspannt-a-de6c68a8-52da-4f0d-94d4-db6b8319cbc6) “ARD Report München” and “The Guardian” and relates most closely with events on the Evros River, where activity has intensified since March 2020\. Questions regarding this practice were addressed to the Greek authorities, with no response\. German foreign minister **Annalena Baerbock** has called for an investigation saying [“humanity and human rights also apply at our \[EU\] borders,”](https://twitter.com/LHreports/status/1541781633988182017?fbclid=IwAR0uHtVcKipxrhvIybpAy3FERJxfvGFIyfYkUSM0OrdobHLxzu9sWI1BeOs)
#### LIBYA
#### Bodies of missing people have been found in the Libyan desert\.

[20 people went missing in the Sahara Desert](http://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/41576/libya-20-migrants-found-dead-in-desert?fbclid=IwAR0-WkhMYurBuvWK8IWKAawCsLH42ha529DuT5YPjUt9S-p1XLGIZA7jQKA) near the border with Chad two weeks ago\. The driver of the group is reported to have got lost on what is a common route used by people migrating from sub\-Saharan African countries towards the Mediterranean\. The bodies were discovered by a truck driver who informed authorities\.
#### SPAIN
#### Reaction to Deaths at Melilla Border

Following the news of dozens of deaths at the Spanish enclave of Melilla as reported in the [AYS Digest earlier this week](ays-news-digest-24-6-22-deaths-at-the-border-with-spain-44683109e846) , Spanish prosecutors are to [launch an investigation](http://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/41559/melilla-migrant-deaths-spain-prosecutor-opens-probe-amid-protests?fbclid=IwAR3MvQ8VP2_cuh099zp5SDsP3-O5G5qL1z8PLqoLk2ohI8_sd1MiOhge2ok) \. Latest reports stated that at least 23 people died and 76 were injured in a mass attempt to cross from Morocco to Spain\. [UNHCR called on both countries](https://twitter.com/UNHumanRights/status/1541743146236870657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1541743146236870657%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.infomigrants.net%2Fen%2Fpost%2F41559%2Fmelilla-migrant-deaths-spain-prosecutor-opens-probe-amid-protests) to ensure human rights were being upheld\.

[Authorities have allegedly demanded that camps be taken down](https://elpais-com.translate.goog/espana/2022-06-29/nador-se-blinda-ante-los-migrantes-y-solicitantes-de-asilo.html?fbclid=IwAR1XJuHzwXMCPQygKPTTzfNWClgpR5qLEm2mLqGdbW7TYM2hFVX7aj6Zu6A&_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US&_x_tr_pto=wapp) and no assistance provided to people in the Moroccan region of Nador, which lies adjacent to Melilla, following the deaths\.

Reports from survivors of the incident have been published\. [A man from Sudan](https://www.publico.es/sociedad/sudaneses-sobrevivieron-salto-melilla-marruecos-matado-dejado-morir.html?fbclid=IwAR14bThwHBf3zmHHC39_4LzCN0bTodoAiBj0xPRCgKaXZMBc16LfH1yfMUU#md=modulo-portada-fila-de-modulos:3x2-t1;mm=mobile-medium) describes the hardship he has faced to reach Morocco and denies the assertion of the authorities that ‘mafias’ were involved in organising the large group to cross\. Survivors are now being held on the pretence of coronavirus measures\.

Groups have responded to the incident by organising an action on 1st July\. [Details here\.](https://twitter.com/SolidaryW/status/1541724692263878656?fbclid=IwAR2ia2MtADj8h0EgymINgUQ9Pn1Wdtlps0AS45oQc6Z-U7FheOC6JbIdNUA)
#### ITALY
#### Protest at Italian detention centre following police ‘violence’\.

Detainees of the Centre for Permanence and Repatriation \(CPR\) in Caltanissetta, Sicily have [staged a protest on the roof of the building](https://www.lindipendente.online/2022/06/27/cpr-di-caltanissetta-i-migranti-protestano-sui-tetti-dopo-i-pestaggi-della-polizia/?fbclid=IwAR3LQUK9GAsTpJTtJoHhGOf3yggCI0Iue5TtSA1YMQTnWacRah8kzl3_0sU) \. The group are protesting lack of healthcare and police beatings\. The action was directed at the Tunisan Consulate, who were asked to “see with their own eyes” what the conditions are\. The action started after [the beating of a Tunisan boy by police, who was then denied treatment](https://www.meltingpot.org/2022/06/cpr-di-caltanissetta-dopo-la-protesta-sui-tetti-presidio-per-la-sua-chiusura/?fbclid=IwAR1XJuHzwXMCPQygKPTTzfNWClgpR5qLEm2mLqGdbW7TYM2hFVX7aj6Zu6A) , emergency vehicles were prevented by the police from attending\. Other detainees contacted the [LetCIEntrare campaign](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=it&tl=en&hl=en-US&client=webapp&u=https://www.lasciatecientrare.it/) to report what was happening\. Previous reports have criticised the CPR before, especially given that extradition is unlikely\.
#### CYPRUS

People from Bangladesh are claiming asylum in Cyprus after [escaping from untruthful work situation](http://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/41551/how-bangladeshi-migrants-end-up-in-cyprus?fbclid=IwAR29o7WEg0NfzSTY7r5fkikt9v60ZxOpNJCH1CVahpxNY6uESTSsWJ6Hsmo) s\. Infomigrants shares the story of two men who were promised work on an apple farm in northern Cyprus\. Via three flights and thousands of Euros, the men ended up working on a construction site, confined to an overcrowded house and had their documents confiscated\. The report examines in detail the implication for the people who have been lied to, who then seek help in the Southern, European part of Cyprus\.
#### GREECE
#### Protest against camp closure

Residents of Eleonas Camp have protested in Athens against the closure of the camp\. Opened in 2015, Eleonas camp was the first official temporary accommodation centre in Greece\. A small girl from Afghanistan was quoted as saying:


> [“The camp has become like our village, like a home\. It’s where my friends are\. It’s where i go to school,”](https://twitter.com/rspaegean/status/1541886254693900290) 





And some good news from Greece\. A young man from Iran, who arrived in Greece with his mother on a small boat three years ago, is ready to start university\.

#### UKRAINE
#### Ukrainians Forced in Russia

Hundreds of thousands of people have been [forced to resettle in Russia](https://www.ekathimerini.com/multimedia/videos/1187789/surviving-russias-filtration-camps/?fbclid=IwAR0KCzGSeI8XzAqRvsHRWUQDHieEz1yp4Jc2COJ4QEZiGrzL0oxrR6WIYlo) \. Victims of the war with Ukraine were put on buses in a process named “filtration” and taken to Russia where they faced interrogation\. Some people managed to escape to Estonia and shared their experiences, shedding light on this shocking practice\.
#### SEA/SAR
#### Further tragedies as sea

The MSF rescue vessel Geo Barents was involved in a tragic rescue which resulted in [at least 30 people currently missing](https://www.msf.org/least-30-people-feared-dead-after-tragic-rescue-central-mediterranean?fbclid=IwAR2ia2MtADj8h0EgymINgUQ9Pn1Wdtlps0AS45oQc6Z-U7FheOC6JbIdNUA) , and a pregnant woman confirmed to have drowned\. The flimsy, rubber boat was partially underwater when 71 people were taken safely onboard\. The vessel now awaits a port of disembarkation\.

[A search was called for a boat](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1541726420363350016?fbclid=IwAR3rKjOe4tL--sH0TMhvEj_fmLeg-nqy6uBloyDbKlbju5PI_tMgGU6LTOQ) missing between Tunisia and Lampedusa\. Contact was lost for 30 hours but the boat eventually rescued and the passengers arrived safely to Italy\.

Meanwhile, news of [36 people in distress near Malta](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1542419009295056897) was shared\. 24 hours after the first call for assistance, the group were still awaiting rescue\.

In other sad news, a [t least 13 people are suspected to have died](http://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/41574/at-least-13-migrants-die-as-boat-catches-fire-off-senegal?fbclid=IwAR3MvQ8VP2_cuh099zp5SDsP3-O5G5qL1z8PLqoLk2ohI8_sd1MiOhge2ok) when a vessel caught fire off the coast of Senegal\. The boat was carrying 140 people, allegedly hoping to make the journey to the Canary Islands\.

The Italian authorities have removed data relating to Search and Rescue activities from their website\. In a suspected attempt to remove transparency from the role of authorities in rescue missions, publication Altreconomia attribute the removal of the data to further muddy the waters regarding the interaction of the EU and the so\-called ‘Libyan Coastguard’ and wider political implications, explaining:


> “At sea, as required by international law, “castaways” are rescued, regardless of condition, nationality, income, language, labels\. And in fact, until 2018, the Italian Coast Guard, which knows this golden rule well, has never lent itself to exploitation or distortions of a political nature\. _The Search and Rescue_ \(Sar\) activity bulletins removed, and [which we republish here](https://altreconomia.it/app/uploads/2022/06/ReportGC_def-1.pdf) , document this change of approach and the transformation of the classification of relief operations\.” [Altreconomia](https://altreconomia.it/la-guardia-costiera-rimuove-i-dati-sullattivita-di-ricerca-e-soccorso-nel-mediterraneo/?fbclid=IwAR0bIKzllZWlA9dJhOYrDQxE9EvllOX0hCC97ELLsdf4r0oDV0miYZIXRLQ) 





[SeaWatch 4 was finally granted a port of safety\.](https://twitter.com/seawatch_intl/status/1541680536539860994?fbclid=IwAR3rKjOe4tL--sH0TMhvEj_fmLeg-nqy6uBloyDbKlbju5PI_tMgGU6LTOQ) Those rescued have now disembarked at Porto Empedocle, Sicily\.

The difficult journey of a man rescued recently by Ocean Viking was shared to give context to those who need rescuing\.


■■■■■■■■■■■■■■

He shared to our crew that he tried 6 times to flee the violence in #Libya but was intercepted 4 times by the Libyan coastguard &amp; illegally returned to detention centers: https://t.co/Cw3X1V4agp
