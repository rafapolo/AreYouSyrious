### Lithuania

Authorities on both sides of the border between Belarus and Lithuana are preventing people from \(re\- \)entering the country, after they were pushed back by Lithuanian police\. [Alarm Phone](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1423571391954264065) was contacted by a group of five people who have been without food, water or any kind of support for more than two days now\.

### Germany

Following court rulings that people cannot be deported to Greece and Italy due to inhumane treatment, CDU member Alexander Throm criticized Italy for aiding secondary migration\. By creating such poor conditions, the government wants people to continue on to Germany, he said, speaking to [Augsburger Allgemeine](https://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/politik/Fluechtlinge-CDU-kritisiert-die-Asylpolitik-Italiens-scharf-id60276521.html?fbclid=IwAR2LAR-z1NHlnwCGLU_uNq1X7UiVfwWFitWXqsj4SdwvodrDyRlt0HCMoqE) \.

### France

Residents of the Mesnil Amelot detention centre \(CRA\) are locked up, as they are accused of not having residence documents\. Some days ago, they started a revolt, Statewatch [writes](https://www.statewatch.org/news/2021/august/france-revolts-in-detention-centres-the-government-throws-oil-on-the-fire/?fbclid=IwAR1y1fE5WAlNjS-SihVOuPAXrhPGluOfvCwaddNC63zW3WP1CyJsxK0ixGA) \. One of the reasons for the revolt are forced PCR tests upon deportation\. “Those who refuse are taken into custody at the end of the detention period and often sentenced to long prison terms for impeding their own deportation\.” This leads to a vicious circle of detention center and prison\.

Within two days, the police in Calais evicted the area twice and seized almost 80 tents\. Since April, they have also been doing this in the afternoon, leaving people homeless for the night, Human Rights Observers report\.

> > ⚠️ En moins de 48h, deux opérations d'#expulsion ont eu lieu à #Calais

Depuis avril, celles-ci se déroulent désormais également l'après-midi, laissant les personnes #exilées sans abri pour la nuit.

Malgré les conditions météo, au moins 77 tentes ont été saisies sur ces 2 jours. https://t.co/VIYuByievn

### UK

As more than 10,000 people crossed the English Channel so far this year, human rights organizations have criticized the UK government for not providing safe routes into the country\. Steve Valdez\-Symonds, Refugee and Migrant Rights Director at Amnesty International UK, said to [Kent Online](https://www.kentonline.co.uk/kent/news/asylum-seekers-have-no-safer-option-but-to-risk-their-lives-251886/?fbclid=IwAR1wOFZ5gOw4g4SMy9GuUM8T8wL5aU16cvbc5AOkBJaih5_qEpg2IxBTgrY) : “The reason people are putting themselves in serious danger with these Channel crossings is that there are simply no safe alternatives open to them\.
