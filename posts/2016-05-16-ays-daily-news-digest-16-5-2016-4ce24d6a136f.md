#### GENERAL
### **EU Civil Liberties Committee is traveling to Greece**

A Civil Liberties Committee delegation will travel to Greece from 18 to 20 May to check the situation of refugees at the external borders of the EU and assess how the EU\-Turkey deal to manage migrant and asylum\-seeker flows into the EU is being implemented\. MEPs will visit the Greece/FYROM border, the island of Lesvos, and Athens\. They will also meet representatives of the Greek Government, EU and international bodies, and NGOs\.
#### GREECE
### **Only around 400 out of some 8,500 people have been sent back to Turkey from Greece since the implementation of EU/Turkey deal**

While the EU officials are planning a field trip, data shows that EU/Turkey deal luckily has some troubles when it comes to implementation\. Even though Brussels has succeeded in an almost 90% decrease of refugee flow to Greek islands since the EU/Turkey deal has been put in place, numbers show that only around 400 out of some 8,500 people have been sent back to Turkey since\. As Financial Times reports “Greece has instead approved over 30% of 600 asylum applications from Syrian migrants\. Greek officials say the slow pace of returns reflects their own policy on asylum requests and say that Greece’s migration laws do not recognise Turkey as a safe third country for refugees\. Maria Stavropoulou, a former UN official who heads the Greek asylum service, said: “We fully understand the \[EU\] concerns but if you look at it from the perspective of the rule of law, it is going exactly as it should\.”
### **Weather report warning\!**

High waves of the coast of Leros, Kastelorizo, Samos, Kos and Chios\.
### **49 new arrivals on Greek islands**

Number of people still stuck in Greece remains pretty much the same with 49 new arrivals today: 2 in Kos and 47 in Chios\. Total number of refugees in Greece today is 54,469 with 8,556 in the islands, 14,475 in the Atika region, 2,039 in central Greece, 324 in southern Greece and 29,075 in the north\.
### **New and faster process of registration inside the camps announced**

Due to the small number of cases processed, the Greek Asylum Service will conduct a pre\-registration exercise for international protection in the mainland from end of May to end of July\. The announcement was made in a joint press release today by the Greek Asylum Service, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \(UNHCR\), and the European Asylum Support Office \(EASO\) \. The exercise will be funded by the European Commission \(DG Home\), The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \(UNHCR\) and the European Asylum Support Office \(EASO\) \.
### **Volunteers needed in Greece**

### **Troubles with the new hotspot in Kos**

At the new hotspot opened on the island of Kos, volunteers estimate that there will be hundreds of new arrivals\. The report from ground says that “minors who arrived at Kos island from Turkey are still staying in a small hotel and avoiding both the hotspot and prison, but were told to pack and prepare to move to the hotspot\. So far they can move freely throughout the island\. The refugees held in the local prison will be transferred to the hotspot, too\. To date, no volunteers have been able to enter the hotspot\. It is located close to the airport\. Pictures and more information will follow as soon as possible\. Today, there is a meeting of local volunteers to discuss how to proceed under the new circumstances\.”
### **Hunger strike in Schisto hotspot**

#### LIBYA
### **51 people saved off the coast of Libya**

#### HUNGARY
### **Hungarian policies towards refugees “raise serious concerns” as stated in the new UNHCR report**

Hungarian national legislation and policies towards refugees “raise serious concerns” in relation to their “compatibility with international and European law” and may conflict with the “country’s international and European obligations,” [a new UNHCR report said last week \.](http://www.refworld.org/country,,,,HUN,,57319d514,0.html)

In its report “Hungary as A Country of Asylum”, UNHCR stressed that the legal measures introduced in Hungary between July 2015 and March 2016 “have had the combined effect of limiting and deterring access to asylum in the country\.” Among the worst measures Hungary has put in place, ones which we have reported on heavily and those that many organizations and volunteers have been warning refugees about, include fencing the border, so\-called “transition zones” as the only places to ask for asylum, and detaining refugees under the provisions of criminal law\.

#### FRANCE
### **Crowdfunding campaign in Camp** Linière **— building a new legal center**

Although the crews working around Camp Linière in the city of Grand Synthe still do not know what the government plans for this camp, they are working diligently on improving it\. Camp Linière is the first humanitarian camp in France established by the MSF\. Doctors Without Borders created the platform which welcomes the whole camp, housing and toilets, as well as health center\. All other facilities were built by British associations: communal kitchens, dining rooms, multi\-purpose hall, and an education center\. The teams working there have started a crowdfunding campaign for building a legal center; if you can contribute, please follow the link: [http://bit\.ly/1V6KTCC](http://bit.ly/1V6KTCC) \. The construction of the legal center by the students of the graduate school of Architecture of Paris Belleville is planned from Monday, June 13th through Saturday, June 18th and they are asking for help\.

The humanitarian camp of Linière was run by the all\-volunteer association UTOPIA 56 until the beginning of May\. The French government had promised to reassume control of the camp at the beginning of May, but no real action has been taken\.
#### SPAIN
### **87 people to be relocated to Spain from Greece by beginning of June**

Moves reports that Spain has announced that the country is ready to receive the first group of refugees from Greece\. A group of 87 people currently in Greece will be relocated to Spain “between May 24th and 26th, and 63 more would arrive at the beginning of June,” the Spanish Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz said\.
