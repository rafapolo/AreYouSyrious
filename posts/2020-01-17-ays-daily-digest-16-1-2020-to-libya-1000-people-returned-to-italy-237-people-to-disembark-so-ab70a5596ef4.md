### 237 people will disembark safely to Italy while 1000 are returned to Libyan detention

A look into the Central Mediterranean Route for the first two weeks of 2020\.

[ECRE](https://www.ecre.org/safe-ports-in-italy-for-237-people-but-1000-returned-to-detention-in-libya/) \(European Council for Refugees and Exiles\) reports:


> “The search and rescue vessels Open Arms, run by the Spanish NGO Proactiva Open Arms, and the Sea Watch 3, run by the German NGO Sea Watch, received permission to disembark a total of 237 people in the Italian ports of Messina and Taranto\. In the course of last week\. The Open Arms had rescued 119 people in two operations and the Sea Watch 3 rescued a total of 118 people in three operations at the Central Mediterranean\. Sea Watch reports that Maltese authorities failed to initiate or delayed rescues on several occasions\.” 





At the same time, according to IOM, at least 953 people were returned to Libya in these last two weeks\. _“Most were disembarked in Tripoli and all were taken to detention centres\.”_ Heavy clashes in Tripoli over the last 9 months seem to be part of the cause of more people departing for the Central Mediterranean route\.

Lastly, the first two weeks of the new year have seen **63 recorded deaths** in the Mediterranean\.

### Legal Centre Lesvos published a “CALL FOR ACCOUNTABILITY: Apparent Suicide in Moria Detention Centre followed failure by Greek State to provide obligated care” on Thursday\.

They make very clear, in regards to the 31 year old man from Iran who died by hanging himself in Moria on January 6th, that:


> “Police knew before they detained him that he had serious mental health issues, according to reports from several detained with him\. Despite this, for approximately **two weeks prior to his death he was kept in isolation** \.” 





The conditions this man faced were horrid and he was obviously in agony:


> “According to other people detained in PRO\.KE\.K\.A\., he spent just a short time with other people, before being moved to isolation for approximately two weeks\. While in solitary confinement, even for the hours he was taken outside, he was alone, as it was at a different time than other people\. **For multiple days he was locked in his cell without being allowed to leave at all, as far as others detained saw\.** His food was served to him through the window in his cell during these days\. His distressed mental state was obvious to all the others detained with him and to the police\. He cried during the nights and banged on his door\. He had also previously threatened to harm himself\. **Others detained with him never saw anyone visit him, or saw him taken out of his cell for psychological support or psychiatric evaluation** \.” 





They continue to address how terribly inadequate healthcare in the prison is run by AEMY and the Greek government:


> “\(The\) medical team supposedly consists of one social worker and one psychologist\. However, the social worker quit in April 2019 and was never replaced\. The psychologist was on leave between 19 December and 3 January\. The man was found dead on 6 January meaning that there were only two working days in which AEMY was staffed during the last three weeks of his life, when he could have received psychological support\. This is dangerously inadequate in a prison currently holding approximately 100 people\. KEELPNO is the only other state institution able to make mental health assessments, yet it has publicly declared that it will not intervene in the absence of AEMY staff, not even in emergencies, and that in any case it will not reassess somebody’s mental health\. 





Tragically they conclude:


> “If we believe that this individual took his own life in order to escape from the abyss of PRO\.KE\.K\.A\., then it was the result of prison conditions that push people to despair, and the failure of multiple state agencies to provide him obligated mental health care\.”

### Greece has announced a list containing 12 “safe countries” and NGOs are worried about the ramifications for asylum procedure, especially for gay and transgender refugees\.

Lefteris Papagiannakis, Vice\-Mayor for Migrants, Refugees and Municipal Decentralization \(Athens\) when asked by [Info Migrants](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/22118/fears-that-greek-safe-countries-list-poses-a-threat-to-human-rights?fbclid=IwAR2eQrni6z6vOt4lisf9G0k2ctMREp6D7xPLb1UQJIIQ5X096wl_6bZc4sQ) how this list might change procedure said:


> “We have to wait until we have some hindsight on this issue to know more, but what is certain is that people who come from these countries now have less chance of obtaining asylum if their case is not very, very severe\. And again: the persecution suffered in one of these 12 countries needs to be easy to prove\. For example, an asylum seeker who is a visible opposition figure in the media is more likely to be considered than an individual who has fled his country because he is regarded badly in his village due to of his sexual orientation\. 





> Moreover, one can envision with a fairly high probability that a migrant who says he is homosexual will be treated with more mistrust from now on\. \(However, in seven of the 12 countries on this list — Algeria, Gambia, Ghana, Morocco, Senegal, Tonga, and Tunisia — homosexuals and transgender people are subject to prosecution\. \)”

[The Evangelical Free Church in Gelsenkirchen\-Buer](https://www.kirchenasyl.de/portfolio/pm-zur-gewaltsamen-aufloesung-des-kirchenasyls-in-gelsenkirchen-buer/?fbclid=IwAR3UAnBItVp0luOBVX8IHLWZwSqayivDxReVmBcGWNgyCvcJkplLApa7Ulk) is reporting that early in the morning on Monday January 13th, immigration authorities took a young man into custody and deported him to Afghanistan the same day\. This is a new a disturbing action since:


> “This has resulted in the first violent dissolution of a church asylum in NRW since 2016, although in principle since 1995 the NRW state governments have given assurances that church asylum should be respected and not broken by the authorities\.” 





The Pastor of the church stated how disgraceful this is:


> “We are horrified by the break in the church asylum ordered by the BAMF and implemented by the immigration office in Gelsenkirchen\. We as a community maintain that it is right and legitimate to protect refugees from deportation through church asylum if they face a concrete danger\.”
