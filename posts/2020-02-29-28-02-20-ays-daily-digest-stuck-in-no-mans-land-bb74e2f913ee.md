### **Greece / Turkey Border Situation**

On Thursday evening, Turkey ordered police, coast guard and border patrol officers to stand down in response to the deaths of more than 33 soldiers by Russian\-backed Syrian Government forces\. On Friday, reports poured in about refugees making their way to the border, sometimes even assisted by the Turkish government\.

Today busses in Istanbul were picking up refugees to drop them off in Edirne, a Turkish town close to border crossings with Greece &amp;Bulgaria.

In response to questions regarding the Turkish governmentтАЩs position on the situation, the spokesman of the Turkish Justice and Development Party, Omar Jilick said:

_тАЬOur policies about the refugees didnтАЩt change but we canтАЩt from now on control their movements\.тАЭ_

The exact number and makeup of the travelling refugees still cannot be verified, as reports about how many are on the move are conflicting and subject to exaggeration\. However, it seems as of last night around 150 refugees from Syria, Iran, Afghanistan, and Palestine were trapped in the border region, specifically between Edirne and the Greek border\. This area is being called a sort of no manтАЩs land, where there is nothing but sprawling fields and darkness\. Some on the ground have reported that refugees wishing to return to Istanbul are facing resistance from Turkish forces\. Prevented from returning to Istanbul and prevented from entering Greece, these refugees seem to be stuck in no manтАЩs land as tensions on all sides rise\.

Reports coming through social media showed what appeared to be Greek authorities firing teargas at refugees\.


[![Update: Turkish/ Greek border Edirne, the Greek authorities are throwing gas on people, there is innocent women and children who are stuck in a political game.

The news around the situation is troubling for two reasons: 1\) The Greek authoritiesтАЩ use of teargas on refugees at the border is inhumane and puts lives at risk 2\) Trapping refugees in the border region with no option to move will only increase tensions and further endanger everyone present\. Turkey seems to be playing with refugeesтАЩ lives in order to fulfill its political ambitions of garnering Western support against the Syrian regime and in doing so is putting many at risk\.

You can see in this video by @[egemengok_](https://twitter.com/egemengok_) that there are no guards on Turkish side.

People walking freely into no man's land only to be blocked by Greek border guards. https://t.co/bZo4fxFWTT

In its own response, Greece has reportedly sent backup troops to the border and has supposedly closed the entire border not just for refugees, but for everyone\.

In response to the declaration, local Greek media reported an increase of sea arrivals today\. It must be noted, however, that this is probably unfounded information, as the numbers of arrivals seem to be similar to those on any other day\.

### **Sweden**

A Lebanese family which has been living in Sweden since 2004 will be deported back to that country\. The family originally fled because of political persecution and even changed their names once they arrived in Sweden\.

The daughter, Sofia, aged 14, was born in Sweden and if she is deported it will be to a country she does not call home\. The case of the family has sparked a lot of reactions on social media and a petition was started which now has more than 8000 signatures\. The 26\-year\-old son, Pierre, finished school in Sweden and is now working\.

Their case is now pending before the Migration Court of Appeal\.

### **Syria**

The UN chief Ant├│nio Guterres described the current displacement crisis in and around Idlib and the escalation in fighting between Turkish and Russian\-backed Syrian forces, as тАЬone of the most alarming momentsтАЭ of the nearly decade\-long war\.

_тАЬWithout urgent action, the risk of even greater escalation grows by the hour\. And as always, civilians are paying the gravest price\.тАЭ_

The UN reports that even safe zones such as IDP camps and shelters where displaced families have sought refuge have been struck by shelling\.

тАЬ _The most pressing need now is an immediate ceasefire before the situation gets entirely out of control\.тАЭ_

[WHO](http://www.who.int/en/) Spokesperson Christian Lindmeier also described the situation as тАЬmayhem\.тАЭ
