#### Feature

As investigations into Greek misuse of EU funds meant to benefit refugees continue, the European Commission has released a timely report that gives a breakdown of EU financial support to Greece, detailing which EU fund disbursed which amount of money, and which Greek ministry received it\. Simply put, the EU has allocated over one billion euros to Greece since the refugee “crisis” began\.

Of course, not all of this money has been disbursed — though the amount paid thus far is around 506 million euros, still a staggering sum, especially given the disparity between this supposed output and the dismal reality of Greek refugee camps\. Some of it is due to be paid out over the next two years — though whether it will, with international scrutiny now on the Greek government’s mismanagement of colossal amounts of EU cash, remains to be seen\.

The human impact of this misuse is painfully evident in the testimony of Omar,\* a survivor of torture in his home country\. He crossed the Mediterranean and ended up on Leros, “one of Greece’s little Guantanamo Bays”\. There, he slept in a container with seven strangers: “Fights\. Arguments\. Violence\. Broken windows\. Shouting\. Self\-harm\. Addictions\. No privacy\. No sleep\. No safety\.”

**“This experience f\* \* \*ed my mind,” said Omar\. “It made me think about my experiences back home\. The two experiences became one\.”**

After months, Omar was sent to Athens, where he was interviewed by a member of MSF’s torture team\. Left out on the street by the Greek government, told to wait for housing by the UNHCR, he had ended up in a squat, the only place that would take him in\. “Accommodation is also not the squat’s responsibility,” Omar noted, “It is the government’s responsibility\.” And yet, faced with the seeming indifference of the government and big international organizations, squats in Athens shelter as many people as they can, struggling to provide basic sustenance\. [148 euro](https://www.paypal.me/Pampiraiki?fbclid=IwAR30dFd3D220niXedcOfs2fdN6tW5wQLOHzPAgvAivmUOcPhaG9VDSNygCg) s can buy food for 100 residents for a week\. What could they do with 506 million?

\*Omar’s name has been changed for protection\. Read his story on the [MSF website](https://www.msf.org/no-roof-no-recovery) , and the European Commission’s report in full [here](https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-migration/20181010_managing-migration-eu-financial-support-to-greece_en.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1bdfKmlv7exwjZQNvVyuIYaS_2gXgzge335cKXafn_O3wURegd-rS6lX8) :

### EU

European leaders will discuss collective migration policy at their summit on Thursday\. On the agenda:

■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 


In anticipation of the meeting, the UNHCR and IOM have [banded together](http://www.unhcr.org/news/press/2018/10/5bc6da414/unhcr-iom-appeal-european-leaders-tackle-mediterranean-deaths.html) to call on the EU to address the disturbing number of deaths at sea so far this year\. Below, a useful Twitter thread outlines European complicity in these deaths:

■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 


Sally Hayden, a journalist focusing on migration issues, notes that while it’s important to call out the EU’s negligence with regards to rescues in the Mediterranean, it’s hardly the only place where refugees are dying because of bad policies\. “The focus shouldn’t be just on deaths in the Med, bc that justifies the EU policy of paying the Libyans to intercept/’rescue’ refugees trying to escape,” she wrote on Twitter\.

### Sea

287 people rescued off of five boats in the Alboran Sea today, according to Salvamento Marítimo\.
### Malta

A rescue boat with 44 asylum seekers aboard has finally disembarked in Malta, after being turned away from Lampedusa earlier in the day when the Italian government refused to let the boat dock\.


■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 
> **[Matteo Villa](https://twitter.com/emmevilla) @ Twitter Says:**

It appears this was just another arm-wrestling between Italy and Malta, not something (much) more serious than that.

Surely, situation in Central Med continues to be unpredictable.

At last word from Aegean Boat Reports, seven boats have landed on the Greek islands on Wednesday, carrying 291 passengers\. Five of the boats landed on Lesvos, which remains drastically over capacity even as transfers to the mainland continue\.

According to ReliefWeb, 654 people arrived on the Aegean islands this past week, a significant decrease from both last week’s arrivals and last year’s arrivals for the same period of time\. Over 17,500 refugees remain trapped on the Aegean island hotspots, subject to the “geographical restriction” that prevents them from moving to mainland Greece while they wait for their asylum claims to be adjudicated\.

**An important notice on procedures for reporting unaccompanied minors in Greece:**

Volunteers from the Athens Volunteers Information and Coordination Group underscore that it’s incredibly important to be aware of the laws in Greece when dealing with unaccompanied minor children\. Though it’s tempting to want to take in and shelter children who might be living on the street or in an unsafe situation, it is illegal to house — or even know the whereabouts of — minors under the age of 15 without properly reporting that to the Greek authorities\. For more guidelines on dealing with minors in Greece, see the full Facebook [post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/AthensVolunteersInformation/permalink/1524559607676331/?hc_location=ufi) \.

### Albania

More border externalization — this time in Albania, a country that has been lobbying to join the EU since the early 2000s\. An unprecedented law signed between Europe and the Balkan nation will allow Frontex to enter Albanian territory, control its borders with Greece and Italy, and “coordinate voluntary and enforced return” of asylum seekers between EU and Albanian territory\. Macedonia and Serbia both like the deal and want to replicate it in their own countries, according to [reports](https://www.facebook.com/refugee.info/posts/1970588909667913) \.

[According](https://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/albania_en/6953/Albania%20and%20the%20EU) to the European External Action Service’s website, Albania is currently “working closely with the EU to complete reforms that will strengthen its political and economic ties with the EU\.” in anticipation of accession to the EU sometime in the next few years\.
### Bosnia

While the Balkan countries’ leaders mull over dangerous border externalization deals with the EU, their citizens are working hard every day to assure that asylum seekers stay warm this winter\.

A message from [Sos Team Kladusa— Bosnia](https://www.facebook.com/donate/536567570126136/2102987093251986/) :


> Winter is knocking on the door and we are still expecting people on the streets, trapped in completely inhumane and dangerous situations\. Regarding that we are in a hurry to prepare and be ready for the winter these days what fore we urgently need YOUR SUPPORT –

### Sweden

After learning Swedish, enrolling in school, and making a new life for himself in Dalarna, a 12\-year\-old child named Obaid will be [deported](https://www.dalademokraten.se/logga-in/12-arige-obaid-skickas-till-afghanistan-utan-foraldrar-alla-ar-helt-forkrossade) back to Afghanistan — without his parents\.

Obaid faces a future in Afghanistan that is almost certain to include violence, uncertainty, and more trauma\. Following interviews with children, parents and other legal guardians in Afghanistan during the spring of 2018, Save the Children has publicly criticized Sweden’s return procedures\. In a press release, Ola Mattsson, Save the Children’s chief, said that Sweden and other EU member\-states are abandoning their responsibility to protect these children by deporting them\.

According to the organization, the returned \(deported\) children have been given either very limited or no support upon their return to Afghanistan\. About three\-fourths of the 53 children interviewed said they had felt unsafe during parts of the return process and more than half of the children told the researchers that they were exposed to either violence or some kind of force\. 45 of the interviewed children had been enrolled in school in Europe, but only 16 were now attending school in Afghanistan\. 10 children said that they had been approached by people trying to recruit them to commit some sort of violent act\. Several of the children said that they will try to leave the country again\.

The deportation of unaccompanied six\-year\-old Denis, whose mother died earlier this year while pursuing asylum in Sweden, has been temporarily halted, according to Swedish news outlet [Expressen](https://www.expressen.se/nyheter/migrationsverket-stoppar-utvisning-av-denis-6/) \.
