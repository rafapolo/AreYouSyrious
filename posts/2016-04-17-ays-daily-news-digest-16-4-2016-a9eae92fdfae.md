### Body of a three year old Syrian girl found in fishermen’s net\.


> The body of a girl believed to be a three\-year\-old Syrian refugee has been found in a fisherman’s net off the coast of Turkey, reports Orient\-News\.

### **_Syrian refugees are being exploited as seasonal agricultural workers by the Turkish landowners\._**


> Volunteers from Turkey reported on the cases of exploitation of Syrian refugees who have become seasonal agricultural workers by the Turkish landowners\. They are paid in a lump sum at the end of the season, and are given a small piece of land to set up camps to live in\. In the meantime, all food and goods that they need are purchased at a nearby market on a credit system\. The market, which is owned by the landowner, charges them twice the normal price for goods\. The workers believe that at the end of the season they won’t be paid anything because of how much they owe the market\. There is no school for the children\. They do not have running water\. Each building or tent is allowed one light bulb and one power outlet\. Each day they work, each worker must pay 5 Turkish lira \(about 2 US dollars — the cost of a meal\) to a “commissioner” as a fee for finding them work\. Raising awareness on these issues and cases by the organizations and the journalists taking pictures of the conditions in which the refugees live and work has angered the landowners who claim these stories are painting a negative picture of Turkey, and have again, threatened to kick the workers off the land if more photos are taken\. 




### Help needed in Torbalı Camp in the face of possible expulsion by Turkish police\.

The refugees taken to Rome were three families whose homes had been bombed in the Syrian war, the Vatican said in a statement as the Pope departed the Greek island of Lesbos\. The Vatican will care for them\. 





> “We ask religious communities to increase their efforts to receive, assist and protect refugees of all faiths, and that religious and civil relief services work to coordinate their initiatives\. For as long as the need exists, we urge all countries to extend temporary asylum, to offer refugee status to those who are eligible, to expand their relief efforts and to work with all men and women of good will for a prompt end to the conflicts in course,” says the Lesvos Joint Declaration by Pope Francis, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew and Archbishop Ieronymos of Athens and All Greece\.

### Idomeni military exercises shock refugees into returning to Piraeus Port\. Security at the port has increased, and pharmacy translators are needed\.


> Volunteers inform us that as a result of the military exercises yesterday and two days ago at the Greek\-Macedonian border, many of the war refugees who were frightened consequently returned to the port of Piraeus but were not permitted to enter if none of the residents of Piraeus could identify them\. Today the metal gates allowing pedestrians and traffic into Piraeus were mostly closed, with entry points only being at E7, E2 and E1\. This morning police guards stood at each gate and controlled who enters and leaves\. Those refugees with stamps had no problems entering or exiting\. Stamps are a certificate that they live there — that they are registered\. Yesterday even those not registered could come in when someone had “identified” that they live there\. This is valid for the whole port of Piraeus\. There is a fence around certain gates that were previously unattended\. The police have begun stamping the papers of refugees staying in the port in an effort to quantify the current population, and also prevent those returning from camps such as Idomeni setting up in the area, as officials still want Piraeus cleared by the end of April\. Translators \(Arabic and Farsi\) are in desperate need by the pharmacy department at E1\. Anyone who is able to help is asked to contact Team Brit\. 





**1000 refugees at Skaramangas camp\. Volunteers needed to help distribute supplies and provide activities for children\.**


> Volunteers report on the conditions in Skaramangas, the new camp near Athens\. There are about 1,000 refugees there at the moment but room exists for 6,500\. This camp is staffed by the military \(Navy\) but is very open and accessible provided one has ID\. The camp itself is quite clean albeit barren\. Each family has a trailer with beds, toilet and shower\. The military and a social kitchen provide food\. The need there is for volunteers \(at least one or two should be long term\) to help distribute supplies\. It would also be good to set up activities for the children who are pretty bored\. There are at least 3 large tents for activities or socializing\.

> In \#Idomeni, volunteers report on police repression at many points of the camp, including the repression by the secret police\.

> According to the Centre for Protection and Assistance to Asylum Seekers, around 2,000 people from Middle Eastern countries remain “stuck in Serbia after closing the “Balkan route””, as reported by Novi Magazine\. The problem is that around 540 people remain in detention centers, while a large number of people remain unprotected because they are trying other methods of reaching Western Europe\. “A large number of them in parks, they are those who continue to illegally enter Serbia or they just stuck here\. About 75% of people now use the route Turkey\-Bulgaria\-Serbia and want to get to Hungary” said Radoš Đurović, Director of the Center\. According to him, in the first three months of 2016, 1886 people expressed the hope to get asylum, there were 262 applications, and asylum has been granted in 13 cases and 90 refugee identity cards have been issued\.

These 357 migrants were reportedly rescued at sea from voyages leaving Egypt\. Over 24,000 migrants have been rescued in the Channel of Sicily in 2016, while an estimated 352 are missing, according to IOM\. 




#### GERMANY
### Stricter laws on asylum in effect in Germany, granting only subsidiary protection for refugees not “personally persecuted” by war\.


> The stricter law package on asylum \(asylum package 2\) has been passed in February this year in Germany and it has changed the situation for all refugees, including Syrians\. The law sets stricter rules for granting asylum, where escaping war is apparently not a sufficient reason to grant asylum\. The law stipulates that if refugees are facing danger only because of war in general and are not being personally persecuted, they may receive subsidiary protection\. Today it was confirmed that at least 7 Syrian refugees in one of the camps in Germany were granted subsidiary protection \(not asylum\) \. This practice will have a strong impact on the family reunification procedure that could take as many as 4 years\. 




#### SWITZERLAND
### 2000 Swiss soldiers on standby at Italian border\. Austria planning to close its own border with Italy\.


> Switzerland is preparing to station tank battalions on its border with Italy, in order to prepare for what one security director calls a “migrant onslaught”, Swiss media reports\. Approximately 2000 soldiers are on standby\. The news comes on the heels of information that Austria is planning to close its border with Italy\. 




#### THE NETHERLANDS
### Hunger strike begun at Havenstraat last Tuesday\. COA has reacted with increased repression and security measures\.


> Calais Migrant Solidarity \(No Borders\) reports on major problems with the emergency in Havenstraat in Amsterdam\. Since last Tuesday, April 12th, several dozen residents begun a hunger strike\. They no longer sleep in the former detention center, but on the forecourt in the outdoors\. The unrest among residents was caused because no progress is made in their asylum cases\. The residents have been living at Havenstraat since October, sometimes even September 2015\. The only contact with the IND consisted of taking fingerprints\. After that, nothing happened\. Most of the residents would like to bring over their families, but family reunification may be requested only after a status has been obtained\. Since many families are living in uncertain and dangerous situations in Syria, the concerns grow\. There is also dissatisfaction with the living conditions at the Havenstraat\. The location Havenstraat was commissioned by the municipality of Amsterdam, run by the Salvation Army\. As of April 1st, the management was acquired by COA\. Since then, the possibilities for neighbors to provide voluntary support has been greatly reduced\. The residents may no longer cook for themselves\. The centrally controlled food is qualitatively and quantitatively insufficient\. Early last week, residents have written a petition calling for acceleration of the procedures, and for an interview with COA and IND\. There was no reaction\. Then the residents decided to start the hunger strike and camp outside the building\. COA reacted with enhanced safety measures: more access controls, no items \(like blankets\) from inside to outside, and a ban on photographing\. The plastic roof mounted by residents over the sleeping places in the open air, is damaged; security tears it down every morning\. 




#### GENERAL
### Case opened against Greece, Macedonia in response to brutality at Idomeni\.


> The European Court of Human Rights opened up the case against Macedonia and Greece for last Sunday’s teargas bombing, plastic bullet shooting and torturous unannounced military exercise yesterday — all of it at Idomeni Camp\. They still did not find room for indicating an urgent measure at this point\. The applicants, women fleeing war alone with their children, in their majority, are invited to complete their submissions by May 9th\.
