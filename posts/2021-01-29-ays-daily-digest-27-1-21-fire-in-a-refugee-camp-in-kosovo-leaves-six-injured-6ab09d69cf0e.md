### FEATURE

6people were injured after a fire broke out in a refugee camp in Kosovo on Thursday, [local media](https://shqiptarja.com/lajm/zjarr-ne-nje-kamp-emigrantesh-ne-bajr-te-mitrovices?r=kh12) reported\. The victims were taken to a hospital after the fire tore through a residential building in Camp Belvedere, located in the village of Bajr, just outside Mitrovica, a large city in the north of the country\.

A police spokesman for the Mitrovica region, Avni Zahiti, confirmed the incident in a statement to [Radio Free Europe](https://www.evropaelire.org/a/31073830.html) , but would offer no further information on the condition of the injured or the destruction to the facility, saying “we have to wait for the investigation\.”

The camp is run by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and also is part of the special operations unit of the Kosovo police\. The Ministry did not offer comment on the fire, either through its press office or on social media\.

A [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGt0-7AtFxs) released on Thursday by local media shows what remains of the partially burned building, a one\-story barrack\-style structure surrounded by a high barbed wire fence\.

A different local media outlet says that [seven people](https://kosovapress.com/en/a-part-of-the-belvedere-camp-burns-down-7-refugees-are-injured/) were injured in the blaze\.

UNHCR statistics show that in 2020, “ [1,910 migrants and refugees](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/dataviz/103?sv=41&geo=0) entered Kosovo”\. The agency also reports that as of the end of 2020, [8,081 people on the move](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/southeasterneurope) were in either Serbia or Kosovo\.

According to a UNHCR [report](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/documents/details/78279) from July 2020, 924 individuals had applied for asylum in Kosovo as of the end of that month\. Only 11 had received a response; five people received refugee status, three subsidiary protection, and three were rejected\.
### MOROCCO
### Continuation in the same path of migration policies

Morocco reaffirmed its pledge to the Global Compact on Refugees, a commitment the country initially made at the first Global Refugee Forum, held in Geneva in December 2019, [Morocco World News](https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2021/01/333503/morocco-reaffirms-commitment-to-global-compact-on-refugees/?fbclid=IwAR3dXLo0__UGfZDKLDA1XnTV-ukPguNwt6iK74hQP6sbgE5KCAR5U60XcdM) reported\.

Morocco’s Permanent Representative at the UN, Omar Zniber, made the announcement on Wednesday, January 27 at a preparatory session for the Senior Officials’ Meeting on Refugees, to be held in December 2021\.


> _“Faithful to its tradition, the Kingdom of Morocco will spare no effort to contribute to the success of the Senior Officials’ Meeting,” Zniber said\._ 





At the Global Refugee Forum in 2019, the leader of Morocco’s delegation, its Minister for Moroccans Living Abroad, Nezha El Ouafi, [announced](https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2019/12/289310/morocco-pledges-300000-for-global-refugee-compact/) Morocco would contribute $300,000 to the Global Compact on Refugees, aiming to “support the operations of refugees’ census and documentation\.”

The Compact, [adopted](https://www.unhcr.org/the-global-compact-on-refugees.html) by the UN in 2018, has **four stated goals: to “ease the pressures on host countries”; “enhance refugee self\-reliance”; “expand access to third\-country solutions”; and “support conditions in countries of origin for return in safety and dignity\.”**

There are 7,561 refugees and 4,399 asylum seekers in Morocco, according to a September 2020 UNHCR [factsheet](https://reporting.unhcr.org/sites/default/files/UNHCR%20Morocco%20Fact%20Sheet%20-%20September%202020.pdf) \. The overwhelming majority — 4,160 individuals — come from Syria\.

Morocco is itself a major transit country for refugees and migrants trying to reach Europe, usually via Spain\. Many try to make it on small boats to the Canary Islands, a very dangerous journey\. [2,170 people died](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/29366/our-most-tragic-year-2-170-people-die-trying-to-reach-spain-ngo) on this sea route in 2020, a dramatic uptick from 893 deaths the year previous\.
### EU
### UNHCR waking up to support the many claims on pushbacks

As it turns out, the UNHCR is alarmed at the increasing frequency of expulsions and pushbacks of refugees and asylum\-seekers at Europe’s land and sea borders\.


> _UNHCR has made its concerns clear to European states\. The refugee agency calls for urgent inquiries into alleged violations and mistreatment based on credible testimonies that are corroborated by non\-governmental organizations, media and open\-source reporting\._ 





The fact that the people arriving by land are being informally detained and forcibly returned to neighboring countries without any consideration of their international protection needs is by now very well known to everyone\. Although the UN Agency’s voice supports what has many times been reported, said, proven and documented, it arrives late and without a clear action plan\. “Too late and too little”, many involved in advocating for the people’s rights would say\. We now wait to see what concrete actions UNHCR will call for and in what way they intend to “assist states in meeting these international asylum obligations”, as such assistance would’ve been very welcome but has been up until now lacking — much in the same way that the agency’s open and proactive advocacy for people on the move has been lacking\.

There were less than 95,000 arrivals to the EU in the whole of 2020 \(and numbers keep decreasing\) \. Yet the issue of asylum is among the most politicized and divisive\. For many, it is a fixation\. Those numbers should be very manageable for an entire region — one that comprises many wealthy countries\. We agree\.
### GREECE
### Facing a possible case at the ICC

A Washington\-based Syrian rights group filed a case with the International Criminal Court on Thursday, calling for an investigation into alleged crimes against humanity by [Greece](https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/RBE%20Greece%20UPDATE%20No%2013.pdf) for its mistreatment of refugees\.
Prosecutors at the ICC will review the case before deciding whether to open a full\-scale investigation, which would likely take months to complete, it is [reported](https://apnews.com/article/europe-mediterranean-sea-crime-courts-greece-04d5b9d235215e15b0aecbb7792bc6a9?fbclid=IwAR3zWm5Oao5vPw3TcyZ5XBh2Rq6UFlYPIWwDBMnzxoW-RSnJgDGZ52TE7Tw) \.
### Greece will soon become one of the first countries in Europe to utilise facial recognition technology during routine police checks

It is estimated that by the coming summer the Greek police will have received “thousands of mobile devices” that resemble smartphones and will allow the identification of citizens using face recognition software and fingerprinting\. Amnesty International [launched](https://www.amnesty.gr/news/articles/article/24168/na-apagoreytei-i-epikindyni-tehnologia-anagnorisis-prosopoy-poy-enishyei?fbclid=IwAR3W08A--0GHwEnZ1lDaHrLXE80SxSbY0dMjv-xjs6GxQU4CLTZ-LBXN1AI) its new global campaign “to ban the use of face recognition systems”\. According to the organization, this is “a form of mass surveillance that reinforces racist policing and threatens the right to protest\.” See [more](https://www.reportersunited.gr/3643/apo-ayto-to-kalokairi-1-000-forites-syskeyes-tis-elas-tha-skanaroyn-ta-prosopa-ton-politon-se-kathimerines-peripolies/?fbclid=IwAR3zWm5Oao5vPw3TcyZ5XBh2Rq6UFlYPIWwDBMnzxoW-RSnJgDGZ52TE7Tw) \.

As the difficulties people face are multiplying, they tend to fix things themselves, knowing not much help \(and certainly not a timely response\) is to be expected from the people running the situation\.
The most recent such intervention was fixing the electricity in the camp, [Moria White Helmets](https://www.facebook.com/MoriaWhiteHelmets/?__cft__[0]=AZUHqoHMow-7XD4BLlf0e5XbNGEac5ng3944GiZ-r1apf5fE4AUOlcUKIlCpvzc0Tl4Jhcl-Cp9YnAjA5DBzf5pSJuiXhhQZXn4wjQbJQ1zRiWcOXCwfRwXhsG8dgAoGqdkRP2zKQi0F9Vl9uetPjPLb&__tn__=-UC*F) group reported\.


> _Really we lost hope\. We wrote to European politicians and we were just asking for some simple things like electricity, drainage and enough hot water\. We got nothing\. They came and they gave a report saying the camp is improving and all looks really good\. This is what newspaper said\. They even said there are heaters for each family\. Yes there are maybe somewhere in a warehouse but not given to us in this camp\. Why? Because we don’t have enough electricity\._ 




### BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA

The Border Violence Monitoring Network \(BVMN\), of which Are You Syrious is a member, today [published](https://www.borderviolence.eu/ohchr-submission-the-role-of-technology-in-illegal-push-backs-from-croatia-to-bosnia-herzegovina-and-serbia/?fbclid=IwAR0-je30M_vcdDYKmFgcDdVkob0AhR9hYr1wbapJuEIUU-Gy4gLFm__iM1Y) their submission to the UN Special Rapporteur on Contemporary Forms of Racism, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance\.

The report, entitled “The role of technology in illegal push\-backs from Croatia to Bosnia\-Herzegovina and Serbia,” examines the usage of increasingly sophisticated technology to facilitate pushbacks against people on the move in the Balkans\.


> _Devices like drones, thermal imaging cameras, and vehicle scanners have been weaponised against people\-on\-the\-move, making them easier to detect and thus compounding their vulnerability and the dangers they face\._ 





The report was compiled with the support of network members including No Name Kitchen, Info Kolpa, and others\. BVMN submitted its study to the Special Rapporteur last May, after she invited input from human rights bodies, civil society organizations, and others to inform her 2020 report to the UN General Assembly\.

BVMN’s submission is available for download at [this link](https://www.borderviolence.eu/ohchr-submission-the-role-of-technology-in-illegal-push-backs-from-croatia-to-bosnia-herzegovina-and-serbia/?fbclid=IwAR0-je30M_vcdDYKmFgcDdVkob0AhR9hYr1wbapJuEIUU-Gy4gLFm__iM1Y) , and the Special Rapporteur’s full report can be found [here](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/newyork/Documents/A-75-590-AUV.docx) \.
### Meanwhile, in Sarajevo…

Following what we reported yesterday, the Sarajevo Canton Assembly held an emergency session today dedicated to the so\-called “migrant crisis,” where they [adopted](https://www.klix.ba/vijesti/bih/kanton-sarajevo-od-drzave-trazi-da-utvrdi-podnosljiv-broj-migranata-u-bih/210128125?fbclid=IwAR0etdKzdnANXcqEaJ9S912-5SX2uZSqUXwyWEDJiTF3HCcye8b2sGE2S7A) a number of new measures\. Striking a somewhat exasperated tone, the body wrote that “Sarajevo Canton will not and cannot take responsibility and risk of managing the migrant crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina” and called on Bosnian institutions to step up and take charge\.

The Assembly also called on the state to institute a quota on the number of migrants allowed into the country and into camps and then distribute migrant populations evenly throughout the territory\.

This is interesting on a number of levels\. Up until now, the majority of migrants have been housed around Sarajevo or in the northwest Una Sana Canton, while other areas of the country bear no burden\. This has caused tension for years, but in recent months especially resentment has been building in local communities\.

Sarajevo, for one, has had enough\. As part of today’s resolutions, the Canton said it would not allow the construction of any more migrant camps in its territory\. Additionally, the new head of IOM in Bosnia, Laura Lungarotti, addressed the assembly today and [said](https://www.klix.ba/vijesti/bih/nova-sefica-iom-a-u-bih-laura-lungarotti-u-blazuj-nece-dolaziti-novi-migranti/210128036) no more migrants would be registered in Blažuj camp, near Sarajevo\. At over 3,000 residents, the camp is severely overcrowded; there have been a number of [recent fights](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/29872/bosnia-17-migrants-arrested-after-clashes-in-blazuj?fbclid=IwAR0jhDq8vdxknh0cdRc4Y9CpZRIk8H0ep1mlZ86JoH2bv1torI979WBM5as) \.

Some of these measures seem quite ridiculous, though\. The government cannot exactly set a quota on how many migrants it will allow in — people will of course continue to come as they always have, and once they arrive, they will try their best to hide from authorities and travel to the EU as soon as possible\. But what the government can do is speed up deportations, which is precisely what they want to do\. The Sarajevo Assembly asked relevant state institutions to relocate the existing migrant camps, Blažuj and Ušivak, to uninhabited locations near the border “as soon as possible\.” Relocating entire camps is a big ask, though, and even if there was a will, would the central government have the funds?

Oh, and of course, let’s ramp up border security\.

It will be very interesting in the coming months to see what happens in Bosnia\. The Lipa fire tragedy still has no solution, tensions in many of the camps are brewing, and local, regional and state authorities are no more capable of rising to the challenge than they were last year\.
### CROATIA

Speaking of border security, the Croatian Ministry of the Interior has just [spent a whole lot of money](https://twitter.com/Border_Violence/status/1354660807074844673) — 500,000 EUR to be exact — on some [serious long\-range drones](https://www.bug.hr/dronovi/predstavljen-hrvatski-bespilotni-zrakoplovni-sustav-velikog-dometa-10057) \. The drones, manufactured by two Croatian companies, can fly at a speed of 85 kilometers for 15 hours at a time, or up to 1,250 kilometers\. Of course, the drones come equipped with cameras and thermal imaging systems, perfectly designed for tracking people on the move making their way through the forests\.

Another colossal waste of money\.

### BELGIUM
### Suppression of protestors drawing attention to the racist and classist nature of Belgian society

As we reported already, a gathering took place on Albertine Square in Brussels with protesters wishing to denounce racism and the class character of the Belgian justice system\. Enough is enough reminds us that a similar action had been banned by the Mayor of Brussels on December 5, 2020\. “Although this time the rally was not outright banned, it was not allowed either\. The political authorities and the police were therefore free to repress the event whenever they felt like it,” they say\.


> _While an agreement was made with the police officers of the city of Brussels who supervised the demonstration to tolerate it for 45 minutes, the federal reinforcements told us to leave the premises immediately, under the pretext that the rally was simply banned\. Astonished, the different police forces present did not agree on a common approach\._

### SPAIN
### IRIDIA’s Report on the situation in Gran Canaria and Melilla

Center for the Defense of Human Rights and 50 other social organizations have prepared a report they intend to present to the United Nations Special Rapporteur for Human Rights of Migrant Persons as well as the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture of the Council of Europe\.

The report documents and supports their claims that the Spanish Ministry of the Interior and the CNP have “generated situations in which they have relaxed, without legal protection, both the conditions the duration of detention,” creating a space not only for violations of the rights of people on the move, but also, they claim, could indicate potential criminal activities that must be investigated in depth\.
### UK

The following submission outlines policies proposed jointly by The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, Detention Action, Refugee Rights Europe, Choose Love and Kent Refugee Action Network\. It is, however, also based on on\-going discussions among a wider group of organisations, including several French refugee and migrants’ rights NGOs\. The proposal, therefore, is a work\-in\-progress based in this continuing collaboration and will be subject to refining and defining in more detail as this forum continues discussions over the coming weeks and months\.
