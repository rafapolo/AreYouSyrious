### Invisibilisation of people on the move through evictions in northern Serbia

On 7th December on the border between Serbia and Romania, yet another eviction of a squat took place\.

Several people on the move who lived there reported that they were beaten, had their money, shoes and phones stolen\. As reported by No Name Kitchen \(NNK\), the evicted people were taken to a state\-run camp where the living conditions are unacceptable\.

According to NNK many squats in northern Serbia have been evicted over the past two weeks, after a shooting in Horgos on 25th November\. The excuse of the shooting seems to be used at the moment by the Serbian authorities to pursue policies of criminalising people in transit\. The increase in evictions \(which were already being carried out frequently anyway\) following the shooting is once again associating and confusing security and criminality with migration\. It is enough that all people on the move, merely because they are migrating irregularly as they have no other choice, are automatically thought of as criminals\.

But the institutional camps where evicted people are systematically taken are overcrowded and in poor condition, and no long\-term protection is offered in any case\. So people are forced to leave Serbia irregularly, facing a dangerous border\. Rarely is one attempt enough, as pushbacks are systematic\. In the meantime, people on the move can do nothing but shelter in informal camps\. The constant evictions, far from ‘deterring’ anything, only further traumatise the people on the move, driving them further and further away from inhabited places to hide from the police, thus invisibilising them\.

No Name Kitchen wrote in its post:


> “Squats are places where people can cook, talk between them, share warm tea, and ‘rest’ a little after long days of walking\. By being the target of police actions, squats cannot offer to people on the move anymore a moment of respite as they provided sometimes\. As a Syrian man told us today after being evicted ‘there is no more place to sleep in our mind’\.”

### Expanded and updated edition of the Black Book of Pushbacks by Border Violence Monitoring Network

On Thursday, 8 December 2022, the Border Violence Monitoring Network is releasing an updated edition of the Black Book of Pushbacks\.

Hope Barker, Senior Policy Analyst for the BVMN said:


> “In 2020 we published the first Black Book, with over 900 testimonies, and called for an end to the culture of impunity that surrounds human rights violations in Europe\. Two years later and illegal pushbacks continue unabated in spite of an increased evidence base, videos of perpetrators committing these crimes, and hundreds more testimonies\. In this new expanded and updated edition of the Black Book we publish over 1,600 testimonies — and this is just the tip of the iceberg”
