### Moria Residents Protest Conditions in Camp

Early Wednesday morning, a group of Moria residents [protested](https://stonisi.gr/post/8658/metra-prostasias-apo-ton-koronoio?fbclid=IwAR12RvNe563ux63pzOPG4XiviUZ7lVd1jhqcbLfNZzHiWa67SF3xS1RoGhU) in front of the gates of the camp\. The protest is part of a series of [weekly demonstrations](https://www.facebook.com/MoriaCoronaAwarenessTeam/posts/131560571806455?hc_location=ufi) against the conditions in the camps, which have always been unsanitary but now become even more potentially deadly in the face of the global coronavirus pandemic\. The organizers and participants are international — last week the demonstration was made up mostly of Afghan residents, while this week it was mostly residents from Africa who turned out\.

People are protesting against unsanitary conditions in the camp and overcrowding that could easily be solved if the rest of the European Union did its duty and accepted asylum seekers\.

🇬🇷
Lesvos ≈ 670%
Samos ≈1060% (6869 in a space for 648)
Chios ≈ 500%
Mainland camps: close to or beyond 100% all 

Bulgaria: 7% (approx. 5000 empty places) 

What's the policy goal behind such 'common' response?

The Greek government is [claiming](https://stonisi.gr/post/8662/mh-to-desete-kai-kompo?fbclid=IwAR1Q5G18zc1YPplAtHY_dkx1evncVScGh6EZ7TOGL5YoIQInNeMstKcDXV4) that 400 asylum seekers will be relocated from Moria to the mainland next Sunday, at a ceremony that will even be attended by Notis Mitarakis, the Minister for Asylum and Immigration\. Residents and media are not trusting this announcement, because last weekend a different planned transport for 1500 people was cancelled\. Even if several hundred “lucky” people are allowed to leave Moria, the camp will still be thousands over capacity and the conditions for those who remain will still be terrible\.

Instead of improving conditions in the camps or addressing the concerns of residents when they rightfully pointed out how deadly an outbreak would be, Mitarakis [said](https://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2020/04/29/greece-hotspots-covid19-coronavirus-islands-infections/) on Wednesday that there are no cases so far in island hotspots and implied that the government’s response should be praised because … they carry out daily checks\. Never mind that most residents of island camps don’t have access to running water, basic hygienic supplies, or enough space to social distance properly\! 130 people who were detained on beach camps in the North of Lesvos and were finally transferred to Moria recently don’t even have [any kind of shelter](https://twitter.com/teammareliberum/status/1255578655125901312) within the camp\. In an [interview](https://vimeo.com/412617482?fbclid=IwAR35K56IvjXZSUKRaA7Sb_6ZcEsws69jpWaLDW0KxQO2h05uOEufm5wr0Ic) with Mission Lifeline, a mother stuck in Moria talks about the dangerous, unhygienic conditions her and her children are forced to live in\.

There are many examples of International organizations and NGOs are trying to help, such as by [donating medical equipment](https://rsaegean.org/en/every-life-counts-donation-of-medical-and-technical-equipment-to-lesvos-vostaneio-hospital/?fbclid=IwAR1UQO_LJ3T2Cx8WEDP8jKnGwnHVro3FFuAF2J5kzQpk-icIiFRq7_r6bXA) to the hospital on Lesvos, but it is not enough\.

Even if the Greek government is ignoring the protests of people in Moria, we must not\! Something must be done to fix the situation in island camps\.

SEA
### Another Illegal Pushback Off the Maltese Coast?

Late Tuesday night, AlarmPhone [were contacted](https://www.facebook.com/watchthemed.alarmphone/posts/2648051572135736) by a group of 62 people that escaped Libya\. The boat was [potentially spotted](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1255270106478845957) by a Frontex plane and AlarmPhone contacted the Italian and Maltese authorities, so the European authorities were aware that dozens of people were in distress, but did not take action\. Unfortunately, AlarmPhone lost contact with the ship in distress and they do not know where the people on board are, although they are afraid they were the victims of another illegal pushback to Libya\.

Two weeks ago, another group was pushed back to Libya after entering Maltese sea territory\. [Here are the faces](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1255451684169486336?fbclid=IwAR3QbEMkG5ZONNQNsFmMky0vLzAf1WM3aTN2gWEcogVPBviRNcmnTy1YK5k) of some who died after the pushback\. When the EU ignores people in distress, or actively pushes them back to Libya, this is what happens\.

GREECE
### Government Uses COVID\-19 As an Excuse to Deport, Another Crack Down on People on the Move

Following [yesterday’s report](ays-daily-digest-28-04-20-police-raid-in-diavata-camp-near-thessaloniki-fear-of-pushbacks-to-9350ab907399) by AYS of a potential illegal pushback from Diavata camp, Greek news [broke the story](https://www.efsyn.gr/ellada/dikaiomata/241151_akoma-30-prosfyges-exafanistikan-apo-ti-samo) that another group of 30 people “disappeared” from Samos\. Witnesses from the village of Drakakia saw a group of people land on the island’s shore\. The group later came in the village and as is customary, asked residents to notify the police\. A vehicle arrived to pick them up but their arrival was never registered and the police are denying the incident occurred\.

Aegean Boat Report published [video footage](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=3586634474696959) of another incident where a boat was captured by the Turkish Coast Guard\. However, the Greek Coast Guard was at the ready to push back the boat if it crossed into Greek waters, showing that despite the pandemic, the government is continuing its illegal border violence campaign\. Either people are pushed back in the sea and left to drown or if they are able to reach land, they are pushed back without being registered or allowed to apply for asylum\.

In the same [statement](https://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2020/04/29/greece-hotspots-covid19-coronavirus-islands-infections/) where he talked about coronavirus, Minister Mitarakis claimed that there have been no arrivals in April\. This is clearly untrue — people are still arriving in Greece, the Greek government is just pushing them back, breaking international law by refusing to register them, and lying to the media\.

Journalists, NGOs, and people on the move have already exposed the Greek government’s illegal pushbacks, which are often done in unsafe liferafts that have a high risk of capsizing at sea\. To deport people during a pandemic, when international travel is mostly banned and most countries have stopped repatriations, is even more dangerous and immoral\.

In addition to illegal deportations, the Greek government is using emergency coronavirus response measures as an excuse to target the most vulnerable, including people on the move\. Mitarakis said the government [might deny](https://twitter.com/katymfallon/status/1255396625335361537?fbclid=IwAR3jwcUYm411K3T1QVwg0A4gYTCAbMA5EdwTD-RcaAylnkKgyuLzqYnDLKY) asylum to people found violating coronavirus emergency measures\. While a Greek citizen flouting government regulations will only have to pay a fine, a non\-citizen could lose their entire future and be deported to an unsafe country for the same violation\. It’s also much harder for asylum seekers living in crowded camps to follow government regulations about social distancing in the first place\. In addition to penalties being harsher for people on the move than for Greeks, police are targeting the most vulnerable with tickets and fines\. 81 homeless asylum seekers in Thessaloniki [reported](https://www.mobileinfoteam.org/police-fines-homeless?fbclid=IwAR0gpkd96xogAcFdd3yRMjAD9JbQBGvfqBVRTEEjNf331xP1-G3_dojlHjA) being fined for leaving their home — which they don’t even have\. The police specifically target the homeless by waiting outside a camp people use to shower and distributing tickets\. If the government actually cared about stopping the spread, they would find homes or at least temporary housing for these people\. The only outcome of their current actions is abuse of power\.

Greece and Austria [formally signed](https://www.facebook.com/MoriaCoronaAwarenessTeam/posts/131687085127137?hc_location=ufi) a two\-year agreement \(via videoconference\) in which Austria will give Greece about 181 containers to use for housing and medical facilities in camps\. The first batch of containers [will be sent](https://www.ekathimerini.com/252155/article/ekathimerini/news/greece-austria-sign-deal-for-lease-of-181-containers-for-migrant-housing?fbclid=IwAR3Q6YJ154mfgpcjkM8InyKqAXBFW-vx5httyUubNiKBNM9gV2OCZoYIc18) to Samos after last week’s fire damage\.

Hopefully, these containers are more sanitary and provide better protection against the weather than flimsy tents, but people have the right to live in proper houses, not shipping containers\!

SLOVENIA
### Slovenia To Accept Unaccompanied Minors

Slovenia [has finally agreed](https://english.sta.si/2757624/slovenia-to-accept-four-migrant-children-from-greece?fbclid=IwAR00KhBuAYmmgJ6SESvXK0rafaEpLq36PkfBud1XPGQOSygt8JnhzXyOXaU) to step up and accept unaccompanied minors from Greece — but they will only accept four children\. They also said that the children must be younger than ten — because eleven\-year\-olds are dangerous and do not deserve a safe home\. The children are expected to arrive at the end of May\.

While Slovenia is a small country, to accept less than five children and to publicize that fact is absurd\. Luxembourg, which has about a quarter of Slovenia’s population, has taken three times as many children \(which is still low, considering the thousands that are held in Greek camps\) \.

MALTA
### Former Office of the Prime Minister Operative Used to Coordinate Pushback

Neville Gafa’, formerly connected to the Maltese OFM, [admitted](https://newsbook.com.mt/en/the-government-uses-gafa-to-co-ordinate-pushback/?fbclid=IwAR3QbEMkG5ZONNQNsFmMky0vLzAf1WM3aTN2gWEcogVPBviRNcmnTy1YK5k) that he helped coordinate the pushback of 51 people two weeks ago in what media has dubbed the Pasquetta Tragedy\. He said he was asked to do so by someone in the Office of the Prime Minister, although he did not mention who he talked to\.

Gafa’ [is known](https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/100494/my_libya_visits_helped_avert_a_national_crisis_neville_gafa_insists#.XqodBRNKjfY) for his numerous secret visits to Libya, which he claims were done with the goal to save lives but many see them as part of Malta’s strategy to keep people on the move trapped in Libya\.

His testimony shows that the Pasquetta Tragedy was not just a mistake or the result of negligence, but a deliberate plan to conduct an illegal pushback with no concern for the lives and health of vulnerable people\.

No new cases have been [confirmed](https://lovinmalta.com/news/testing-at-hal-far-open-centre-increases-significantly-after-no-new-cases-discovered-in-over-a-week/?fbclid=IwAR3wapZ1ejm38M0rty9XLxPmpnF9woCJbLejnKgyxSgijwdgAyMb6aXrj7M) at Hal Far Open Centre, which until recently was Malta’s hotspot for the coronavirus epidemic\. The government has pointed to its ramped\-up testing program as proof that it is taking the epidemic seriously, even in detention centers, and say that quarantine can be lifted next week if numbers remain low\. However, residents are saying social distancing measures are not being implemented and people are still gathering in large groups\.

SPAIN
### Patera Rescued Off the Coast of Fuerteventura With a Newborn

A baby, born on board, was one of the approximately 35 people rescued from the patera off the Canary Islands [on Tuesday](https://www.20minutos.es/noticia/4241266/0/rescatada-cerca-de-fuerteventura-una-patera-con-un-bebe-nacido-a-bordo/?fbclid=IwAR2qh9RBtlnTyAWqRU6X0FKvRbofaoyyzN-fKmPQWpvABDFQALBCcQfMM5A) \. Everyone was reportedly in good condition, although the mother and baby were [taken to a hospital](https://www.facebook.com/NewsfromtheMed/photos/a.704532923333640/933657607087836/?type=1&theater) to be treated for exhaustion\. Video of the rescue can be found [here\.](https://www.facebook.com/macarena.amores/videos/10218802164299463/?hc_location=ufi)

PORTUGAL
### Portugal To Take 50 Unaccompanied Minors

As part of the EU’s plan to relocate minors from Greek camps, Portugal will [accept](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/24419/portugal-to-take-50-unaccompanied-migrant-children-from-greece-in-may?fbclid=IwAR2h2-o0ji0GUfhZNvWa2H2MVD0FfbiOLfIn0gYl2jm4NB3gkjKejdBSBZE) 50 children out of the overall 1,600 to be transferred\.

The airlift will happen sometime in May, and officials are hopeful that it will be “soon\.”

GERMANY
### Solidarity Actions in Germany

Several organizations in Germany are organizing solidarity actions with people on the move across Europe, especially those stuck in Aegean Island camps\. Eleven German musicians and bands organized a Solidarity for Lesbos online music festival\. They played their music to raise money for Legal Center Lesvos\. More information about the festival, as well as how to donate to Legal Center Lesvos, can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/belitzki/videos/vb.148987085825394/686409228788674/?type=2&theater) \.

In Munster, the group “Eklat” [occupied](https://www.muensterschezeitung.de/Lokales/Staedte/Muenster/4193776-Protestaktion-Gruppe-besetzt-MS-Guenther-und-Ibis-Hotel?fbclid=IwAR1mw0G6WII2jTCjjL14uznLWVGX9K1Ty6YwRGiylMhLbvaZwz_1RAbU5Gc) the MS Gunther, a ship that serves as an event venue, and the Ibis Hotel\. The group’s goal was to draw attention to the crowded conditions in Moria, as well as the fact that hotels in Munster are lying empty even as homeless people are forced to shelter in the streets\.

Without solidarity actions and pressure from local government, Germany would never have agreed to take unaccompanied minors trapped on Greek island camps\. The first group of 47 children [have left quarantine](https://www.facebook.com/NewsfromtheMed/posts/933630417090555?hc_location=ufi) and they are going to their new homes\. We hope they will be able to live out the rest of their lives in peace, safety and dignity\. While this is proof that solidarity actions can be effective, there are still thousands more children \(and adults\! \) in need of safe homes\.

In a sobering reminder that solidarity and advocacy can sometimes be dangerous, a neo\-Nazi [was charged](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/germany-charges-neo-nazi-murder-pro-refugee-politician-200429132501774.html?fbclid=IwAR0DmohjsIX8WNe3nmzE4VM8Budws3C0EVT4nQOywp9K2QKXBrHOUzaDr0U) with last year’s murder of Walter Luebcke, a German politician and vocal advocate for people on the move\. The man was involved in a serious attack on an Iraqi person in 2016 and had been planning Luebcke’s killing since at least 2016\.

FRANCE
### Food Distribution Schedules for Ramadan in Paris

The organization Watizat updated their guide for people on the move in Paris to include food distribution schedules that have been changed for Ramadan\. The information can be found [here](https://guideasile.wordpress.com/?fbclid=IwAR2S2iPJ3cw-DKjpEc9zlA_loq5oEk7_o8kOowrfDoEct9o-crJnJtNUlDQ) in French, English, Pashto and Arabic\.

UNITED KINGDOM


GENERAL
### Danish Refugee Council Launches Global Appeal to “Address Consequences” of COVID\-19

The DRC [called on](https://twitter.com/DRC_ngo/status/1255374162195025924?fbclid=IwAR26sLbQmTew7jMFuovfcUVK308Zs4CA2NOIV4YYBO0C8Sl1FDBO-w3jgi8) the global community to increase aid for people on the move, whose difficult living conditions will be worsened by the pandemic\. The spread of the disease will be worse in places such as refugee camps, where crowded conditions and lack of sanitation make it hard to contain regular outbreaks\. The other consequences of the disease, such as the economic downturn and increased conflict, will displace more people\. To read their full Global Appeal, go [here\.](https://drc.ngo/covid?fbclid=IwAR2DUHwoGGF-ZRi-ZHMQ2w-NhN1e1WQIbyVzH5Dz0mtBs_2LrYyiKh2SrdA)

Eurostat released its statistics for arrivals to Europe in 2019\. [It found](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/24429/almost-13-800-minors-among-2019-eu-migrant-arrivals?fbclid=IwAR2yEoJRKBuh1NzXhpoIa-Ak48Q3IZVSajY1wkklF3bn_YgU8rkkNywSdzw) that almost 13,800 unaccompanied minors came to Europe, or 7% of all asylum applications\.
