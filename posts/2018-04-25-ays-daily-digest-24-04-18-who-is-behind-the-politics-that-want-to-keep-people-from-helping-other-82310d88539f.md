### AYS Daily Digest 24/04/18: Who is behind the politics that want to keep people from helping other people?
#### Volunteers accused of criminal activities, rescue vessels impounded, SAR professionals disabled from work, dubious documents issued and people still kept in dire conditions — a growing number of actions to support claims of a shaping of political decisions to stop people from coming and/or staying in Europe // news from the Mediterranean, Morocco, Libya, Turkey, Greece, Bosnia and Herzegovina & Croatia, Italy, France, Sweden, Norway and the UK

#### The highest Italian court ruled that Iuventa boat will not return to saving lives in the Mediterranean\.

After the court order for the vessel to be impounded, relying on elements that were later disregarded by the outside parties as legal irregularities and gaping holes in the prosecutor’s narrative\.

This week, Forensic Architecture, a London\-based research organization, [released a new investigation](https://blamingtherescuers.org/iuventa) that calls into question the key evidence in the three events pivotal to the case\. Researchers with the organization, who shared their findings with [The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/2018/04/20/mediterranean-refugee-rescue-boat-italy-libya/) , argue that Italian police have withheld and distorted evidence in order to paint a picture of collusion\.
 The Italian and European governments, as well as Frontex, have long pushed the idea that the presence of NGO vessels increases migrant boat departures from Libya, a theory not supported by Frontex’s own data\.

As it was said earlier, the crew of the Iuventa maintains that the case against them is part of a larger plan to remove humanitarian organizations from the central Mediterranean Sea — and in so doing, to stop migrants from reaching Europe\. if you are interested in all aspects of the story, please take time to read the text by Titus Molkenbur: [**The Iuventa will not return to rescue**](https://medium.com/@mol_ti/the-iuventa-will-not-return-to-rescue-593c5905abf9) \.
#### TURKEY
### [7,100](http://www.mynet.com/haber/politika/icisleri-bakani-suleyman-soylu-soylu-su-anda-7-bin-100-civarinda-afgan-geri-gonderildi-zannediyorum-bu-hafta-sonuna-kadar-bu-sayi-10-bini-bulacak-dedi-4065898-1) Afghans rounded up and returned to Afghanistan since early April

In recent weeks the Turkish authorities have escalated a ruthless deportation drive which has seen thousands of Afghans rounded up, packed onto planes and returned to a warzone, Amnesty International representative has [stated](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/04/turkey-thousands-of-afghans-swept-up-in-ruthless-deportation-drive/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=quote&utm_term=VGhlIHNjYW&utm_campaign=social) \.


> “Afghans in Turkey have made hazardous journeys to escape even greater dangers at home, and forcing them back is both unconscionable and unlawful\. Indiscriminate violence routinely claims scores of lives in Afghanistan and no part of the country is safe\. There is no doubt that Turkey is under pressure — it has accepted huge numbers of refugees, mostly financed from its own budget — but these deportations will put lives at risk\.” 





For each of the past four years, more than 10,000 civilians have been killed or injured in Afghanistan, many in indiscriminate attacks by armed groups\. Still, the European countries regard Afghanistan as a “safe country” — only when returns of Afghans are concerned, of course\.

> The interconnection of the rise of xenophobia and racist events with the situation of long\-term population in the islands, as a consequence of the implementation of the EU\-Turkey Joint Declaration, has already been underlined 




“ [The Greek Association for human rights](http://www.hlhr.gr/) expresses its particular concern about the incidents of racist violence that occurred yesterday in square square in mytilene\. In the square there were gathered refugees protesting the process of examining their asylum requests and their long\-term caging on the island\. The attacks carried out by extreme right\-wing groups, with the throwing of banger and other objects in the protestors refugees and the diction of racist slogans, such as “burn them alive”, are appalled\. The fact that, despite the presence of strong police forces at the point of attack, no arrest of the perpetrators of the attack is causing serious questions and needs immediate investigation\.
Eleda has repeatedly stressed that the obsession with the application of geographical restriction is in danger of irreparably damaging the social and political cohesion of island regions\.”
Therefore, they clearly state it is essential to ensure that there is no increase in right\-wing expression and activities and resulting further social destabilisation in Greece\.

Greece is concerned about the increase of refugees and migrants inflow especially through the natural border of Evros river in North\-East\.

Briefing the parliamentary committee, Mgration Minister, Dimitris Vitsas, said that that refugees and migrants arrivals from Turkey have dramatically increased\.
A total 7\.594 people crossed into to Greece through the Evros river and the islands, mainly Lesvos, in the time period from January to April, the minister said adding that 2,168 migrants came through the islands and 2,700 through Evros\.

#### BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA / CROATIA
### Arrested smugglers

More than 20 people were arrested on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as Croatia, in a collaborative international action by the national police departments and by the INTERPOL\. The people apprehended were all a part of a larger group that smuggled people into the EU, mostly from Turkey\. The official report says the authorities have the evidence to support the claims that the people in question illegally acquired financial benefits rising up to tens of thousands KM per person in Bosnia and Herzegovina alone\.
### BiH — A rise in arrivals

According to the latest UN report, in January this year 157 people arrived in Bosnia and Herzegovina, of whom 38 asked for asylum and in February 315 arrived and 79 of them filed applications for international protection\. most arrivals were registered in March \(666\), when 136 people filed for asylum\.

The volunteers in Bosnia and Herzegovina still struggle to help and assist the refugees stuck there in order to provide them at least the basic amenities\.

Violence by the law enforcement officers against the migrants and refugees from Sub\-Saharan countries who are in Nador continues\.
Yesterday the officers used force and unjustified violence against a young man at the taxi station in Zeghanghane towards Bouyafar\. 
In front of the driver, the boy was hit with a glass bottle in the head\.

The second case of agression happened at the hospital Hassani in Nador\. A migrant who wanted to access the hospital to ask for care was violently stopped and subsequently arrested\.

#### ITALY
### Minniti decree — what does it mean?

Minniti decree promulgated last year and the possibility to implement community/voluntary work, even though it was a practice even before\.

_“Migrants will not have the same rights as other citizens, and this by statute\. This is an unbearable, discriminatory approach” which limits “in a very clear and precise manner the right to asylum”\. Association for Legal Studies on Immigration \(Asgi\) president Lorenzo Trucco is worried and forebodes a “very dark horizon”\._

[**Read here**](https://www.asgi.it/english/lorenzo-trucco-asgi-minniti-orlando-decree-not-reform-but-wall-of-laws-that-limit-the-right-to-asylum/) what lies behind the “Minniti\-Orlando” immigration decree
#### FRANCE

Today in the French town of Gap there will be a court hearing for the arrested comrades Eleonora, Teo and Bastien\. They are accused of aiding illegal immigration in an organised band, for having participated in the solidarity march on Sunday\.

This prosecution is an attack against the solidarity of exploited people\.

### Volunteers needed\!

“While the French deputies leave on holidays, after having voted the asylum\-immigration law project, the Utopia 56 volunteers are in Calais with the exiles\.
You too, join us in Calais and Paris, for a day, a week or more\. We lack volunteers now\!” [http://www\.utopia56\.com/fr](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.utopia56.com%2Ffr&h=ATMeU2neuxUSvC0lgU_AY-sBNrwcz20_4pAvfHERp5UhMNcv0SbJq56BEi-BgskLMx9UqifPi7X1so0ftAB0sFFMazkktxYMt0dYtAno3uFEZhhh9XKGbMQ5P0JNg7xC-gKQ2LM)

**First aAid** response team looking for volunteers in Calais during May\.
#### SWEDEN

The Social Democrats in Sweden have [released an electoral pledge](https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/samhalle/a/yvn2nr/s-vallofte-infor-sprakplikt-for-alla-nyanlanda) , where the restrictions for newly arrived people and refugees will become stricter\. The financial contribution will be withdrawn in cases where the asylum seeker is not participating in the language training\.

“We have previously been a bit unclear about the fact that it is mandatory to learn Swedish for people living in Sweden”, a source from the party said\.

With this said, a lot of people are placed in the countryside far away from communications\. AYS volunteers have previously been talking with people who have problems with leaving their kids in kindergarten and combine this with being on time to the Swedish for Immigrant classes\.

It seems to be yet another promise or decision where punishments are used to increase “inclusion”\.
#### NORWAY

An 18\-year old boy took lis own life in an asylum reception centre in Norway\.


> Today he couldn’t\. He couldn’t stand the uncertainty, missing mom and dad, to wait for the answers to asylsøknaden, or the uncertainty of waiting for the police to take him out of the land that he came to, like the land of democracy, the stronghold of democracy, the country that swears to human rights…
