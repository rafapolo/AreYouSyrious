_90 people saved from drowning // Update from OceanViking // New arrivals in Greece // Donations needed for Lesvos // Top Italian officials will stand trial // more…_
### Feature

The state of Denmark has put rejected asylum seekers in a place considered by many as worse than Danish prisons\. These people have done nothing illegal, besides crossing borders\.

The following pictures are a joint statement from the prisoners of Ellebæk camp\.

The statement was gathered by inmate Andrew Martins, block 18 east, cell number 45\.
It was read out loud to the activists outside Ellebaek prison doing a [48 hour protest](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F357617553%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2mbwWxUwvJVZ6N_k9s_zniFkU9pAouT5W3Y7ZRqSq0cETMa8MJ9frbXyU&h=AT2xNaubAwiQD9AbLufTyg2YdhfMaMYSGuLTGGrK25eFidRMG-yDWLrdMuOG0f-BWfGhD5Ln58_us61WdCWrNwhT1b4tNfXL9BtyfDMpTFTctQMJ1eStzeVyA-pg372yorJtQrob8G6vaoOh) from 30th of August to the 1st of September\. He gave the statement to his visitor, an activist who herself has been a visitor to Ellebæk for the last 4 months\.

The statement is important, these are human beings behind the fence, the inmates, have fled from their country of origin to Denmark\. They have been denied safety and basic human rights by the government of Denmark\.

In an update from Nador:


> “Dozens of Syrian refugees among them many children blocked in Nador, organized this morning for a demonstration in front of the border post of blessed ensar, to request to allow them to access the asylum office in melilla\. Without Legal cause, the Nador authorities refused for refugees to be recognized as such by UNHCR so they can submit their asylum application in Melilla\.”
