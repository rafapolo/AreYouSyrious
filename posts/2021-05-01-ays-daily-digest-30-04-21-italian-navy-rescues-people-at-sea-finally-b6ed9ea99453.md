[In the words of one Italian journalist](https://www.facebook.com/angela.caponnetto.54/posts/10223164231606650) , ‚ÄúSomething must have happened‚Äù if, for the first time in years, the Italian Navy actually rescued people in distress in the Central Mediterranean\. But the news is true: 49 people were rescued on the morning of April 30 and are now on board the Navy patrol boat Commander Foscari\. The people were adrift in international waters 75 nautical miles north of Tripoli, and all are in good health, according to a [Navy press release](https://www.marina.difesa.it/media-cultura/press-room/comunicati/Pagine/2021_NS_Il_pattugliatore_Comandante_Foscari_salva_49_naufraghi_nel_mediterraneo.aspx) \.

While several years ago the Italian Navy [was leading rescue missions in the Central Med](https://www.dw.com/en/italian-navy-leads-mediterranean-rescue-of-1800-migrants/a-19240713) , helping to save thousands of lives, more recently the Navy is known for its inaction and its complicity in either leaving people to drown, or sending them back to Libya\.

It has been a busy past few days in the Central Mediterranean\. Sea Watch 4 completed three rescues in under 48 hours, bringing 214 people on board\.

SOS Mediterran√©e‚Äôs Ocean Viking is now home to 236 survivors, and will soon disembark in Augusta, Sicily\. \( [This article](https://www.dw.com/en/over-100-migrants-saved-in-the-mediterranean/a-57392273) gives a good overview of what has been going on in the Mediterranean over the past few days\. \)

At this point we can only speculate what that ‚Äúsomething‚Äù is‚Äîwhy Italian authorities would engage in a rescue mission when they usually do not\. We would like to say‚Äîtentatively‚Äîthat perhaps the winds have shifted\.

In the comments section of the Italian journalist‚Äôs Facebook post, readers expressed similar hope\.

‚ÄúI hope this is not destined to remain an isolated case\. I hope the latest victims have ignited a glimmer of humanity in the chains of command,‚Äù one wrote\.
### SEA
#### Libyans caught on tape

Today‚Äôs news from the Mediterranean is not all good\. The crew of Sea Watch 4 caught on video the Libyan Coastguard beating people in a rubber dinghy\. The people were violently pulled back to the hell of Libya\.

#### Returns to Libya

Meanwhile, the Libyans returned 340 people, including women and children, who disembarked in Tripoli yesterday\.

UNHCR &amp; IRC provided urgent medical and humanitarian assistance to all survivors before being taken to detention.

Over 5,500 persons were returned to Libya since January 2021. https://t.co/kWZbysryeL

Desperate, barefoot, tired and abused, they were led off to arbitrary detention where they face more risks. https://t.co/TspogDdIHr

#### Unaccompanied minors in the Med

Amid all the returns, UNICEF is sounding an alarm about an uptick in unaccompanied minors braving the Mediterranean crossing\. As many as 114 ‚Äòlone children‚Äô were returned by Libyan authorities in one day this week\.

‚ÄúThe number is incredibly alarming ‚Äî it is the most that have been picked up in a single day this year and certainly one of the highest we have ever recorded,‚Äù Juliette Touma, UNICEF‚Äôs regional chief of communications, told [media](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/apr/30/more-than-100-lone-children-rescued-trying-to-cross-mediterranean?fbclid=IwAR0Sv-yDvPDPcbx1EvOeRPdvK2Hpw1e4FPZLi03YoEutOVjiQyLFxNkeKPU) \.

‚ÄúWe are especially concerned that in the coming months as temperatures rise and the weather improves we will see increasing numbers of people including unaccompanied minors trying to reach the safety of Europe for a better life\.‚Äù
### SPAIN
#### Woman gives birth on boat off Canaries

A woman has done what no one should have to do: give birth while fleeing in a boat\. The woman and her hours\-old daughter were among several dozen people rescued by the Spanish Coast Guard late last week, [media reported](https://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/seenotrettung-frau-bringt-baby-auf-fluechtlingsboot-vor-den-kanaren-zur-welt-a-c74db443-a4ac-43df-9d66-872cef12422d?fbclid=IwAR1DAxNHa0DfSzihwqFspvXE42t-8dHkzaC80-l5AS7mj4WM_Vm0ky7y4lY) \.

The boat was towed to the port of Arguineguin on Gran Canaria and the pair were taken to hospital for examinations\. [Here is a video](https://www.efe.com/efe/canarias/portada/de-remolcar-el-cayuco-la-tragedia-a-llevar-un-recien-nacido-tierra/50001319-4525241?fbclid=IwAR3He-A8lvZFItWVgy6pPJulrPSxv4OdHB8Sx-J9-ExdSzP0LDCqtdY5Qh0) of the baby‚Äôs first moments on land\.

#### Ministry of Migration announces proposal to aid unaccompanied minors

The Spanish Ministry of Migration has said it wants to lower the requirements for unaccompanied minors and ‚Äòex\-ward youth‚Äô to obtain a residence card, [media reported](https://www.eldiario.es/desalambre/reforma-reglamento-extranjeria-pretende-regularizar-15-000-menores-migrantes-jovenes-extutelados_1_7888330.html?fbclid=IwAR1DAxNHa0DfSzihwqFspvXE42t-8dHkzaC80-l5AS7mj4WM_Vm0ky7y4lY) \. The proposal will reduce the time limits for getting residency, reduce the economic requirements, assist minors in finding jobs and lengthen the validity of their residence permits\.

‚ÄúThe lack of documentation of these minors poses, in practice, significant difficulties not only while they maintain this condition but, especially, at the time they turn 18 and come of age\. These difficulties have a negative impact on their inclusion and integration into society,‚Äù the draft of the reform reads\.

In the short term, the Ministry calculates that 8,000 unaccompanied minors and around 7,000 ‚Äòex\-ward‚Äô young people will benefit from the change in regulations\.
### BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
#### No Name Kitchen: Update from Velika Kladu≈°a

Read this great update from the field in northwest Bosnia by volunteers of No Name Kitchen\. Good\-quality information here on recent evictions of family squats in and around Velika Kladu≈°a‚Äîan important topic we all need to keep an eye on\.
### GERMANY
#### Data protection for asylum\-seekers in Germany threatened

The federal government in Germany is seeking to introduce a law that provides for the central storage of personal documents of refugees, a move which violates people‚Äôs fundamental rights and can have potentially life\-threatening consequences for people fleeing violent conflict and authoritarian regimes, [media reported](https://www.proasyl.de/news/asylakte-ins-auslaenderzentralregister-fuer-gefluechtete-gilt-der-datenschutz-nicht/?fbclid=IwAR2y_4w98r7OcM64maVuD7HTw4KpDCRzY_QDosp1rMeSGotSpNh0QHNyjbk) \.

Germany is famous for its data protection laws, but apparently the same consideration is not given to asylum\-seekers whose information is stored in government files\. [A new proposal](http://dipbt.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/19/281/1928170.pdf) will store more of people‚Äôs sensitive data in a centralized database: asylum decisions, asylum and residency court decisions, information on people‚Äôs family, sexual orientation, religion, political views, and importantly, people‚Äôs personal identity number from their country of origin\.

Under this proposal, many different wings of government will have access to people‚Äôs data: all 600 local immigration authorities, state reception facilities, the Federal Employment Agency, social welfare offices and job centres, the federal police, public prosecutors, etc\. etc\.

The law aims to improve administrative processes, but as media put it, ‚ÄúThe rights of those affected, especially to data protection and informational self\-determination, are irrelevant\.‚Äù
### UNITED KINGDOM
#### Channel Rescue‚Äôs work highlighted

The group Channel Rescue spoke to Al Jazeera English about their important work keeping an eye on the Channel waters\.

#### Report: Regularization of undocumented people in the UK

The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants released a report called [‚ÄòWe Are Here: Routes to regularisation for the UK‚Äôs undocumented population\.‚Äô](https://www.jcwi.org.uk/we-are-here-routes-to-regularisation-for-the-uks-undocumented-population?fbclid=IwAR3ONfR2LeBCHr-3kQueCNPIzFZlV92Lqfo-uu_iSIYa7f1ij-0r7oWngn4)


> We Are Here is a report based on research carried out by JCWI to better understand the reality of life for undocumented migrants in the UK today\. It explores how people become undocumented, and how vulnerability is produced through the structures of the system itself\. It reveals the systemic weaknesses of our immigration system that lead to so many people becoming undocumented and how a small error, or a short period of illness can change the course of a life\. 




### EU/FRONTEX
#### European Parliament on Frontex budget

The European Parliament has made a decision on the budget of Frontex \( [full text here](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2021-0191_EN.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3XuIX5L4Cjx78mh7UzonA3AVrhru6PoLzfvGVrLmVGlVKXB_KyuulghKM) \) \. Interestingly, the decision took into account the work of journalists in exposing Frontex‚Äôs mismanagement\.

For example: ‚Äú\[The European Parliament\] is seriously concerned over media reports that the executive director had repeatedly ignored reports and advice coming from the fundamental rights officer, concerning its operations in several Member States\.‚Äù
#### EU Commission to focus on sea rescue at Frontex meetings

Following the publication of Spiegel‚Äôs explosive story, [‚ÄòHow Frontex Helps Haul Migrants Back To Libyan Torture Camps,‚Äô](https://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/libya-how-frontex-helps-haul-migrants-back-to-libyan-torture-camps-a-d62c3960-ece2-499b-8a3f-1ede2eaefb83) an EU Commission spokesperson told [media](https://www.rnd.de/politik/eu-kommission-macht-seenotrettung-zum-thema-bei-frontex-treffen-5T42BANBKZDOJOKKBG4R6L2HHM.html?fbclid=IwAR3iGqVZJ53vWEuQzPOzSzl_t-HKNTbegGZRHLgznwnv5H0SgLPWEKFNsbE) that Mediterranean sea rescue operations and Frontex‚Äôs cooperation with the Libyan authorities would be a top priority in the upcoming Frontex meetings\. Efforts will be made to ensure that ‚Äúthere is complete clarity on the matter\.‚Äù
#### Frontex photo competition\!

Frontex is holding a photo competition to celebrate Europe Day on May 9\. The agency is soliciting photos for these categories: Cooperation with national authorities; Frontier landscapes; A helping hand at the border\.
