#### FEATURED: People holding humanitarian protection to be left without accommodation by 31st December in Italy

A security decree from the central service, which manages the reception for migrants in Italy, has essentially abolished ‘humanitarian protection’ and has told anyone with this level of protection that they will no longer have the right to reception\. Their reception will end after the 31st of December\. The ministry appear to be washing their hands of responsibility, passing on it on to the municipalities who must try to avoid putting people on the street in the new year\. Here is what the ministry had to say:


> “Initiatives have been launched to support municipalities in taking care of migrants through the financing of projects using Family funds\. In particular, specific calls are expected to be made for Fami projects aimed at local authorities, to support them in managing the situation represented by the exit of the migrants in question from Siproimi\.” 





Yet of course this makes little difference because _“ **Thousands of people \(are at\) risk ending up on the street in the middle of winter** ,”_ said Arci immigration manager Filippo Miraglia, to la Republica, last week\. He added _“We \(are asking\) the Municipalities to appeal\.”_

Miraglia goes further to say that this ruling does not make any sense because these local authorities have to rempved people from their accomodation after December 31st, and then will have to use _“resources and structures already saturated by the social unease of the cities\.”_

“It is an intervention that does not take into account the recent ruling of the Cassation \(n\.29460 of 13 November 2019\) which definitively certified the non\-retroactivity of the law, which therefore cannot be applied to reception projects started before October 2018\. We hope for a urgent government intervention to avert a crisis that would put people and local authorities, owners of the projects and beyond, in addition to the organizations that manage them on behalf of the municipalities, in serious difficulty\.”

Miraglia and others are asking the municipalities to appeal because of this change in direction in applicable law regarding reception of migrants\.

Authorities confiscated knives and other tools deemed too dangerous to be around the premises\. Camp staff were also asked to stay at home today for secuiry reasons, due to the operation itself\.

#### ITALY

In Catania, Sicily, two men were taken into custody after a police operation discovered that the two were exploiting labour and committing violence against some field workers, who were “employed” in their farm\. Unfortunately this is just the latest story of [exploitation of labour in Italian fields](https://m.catania.livesicilia.it/2019/12/23/minacce-e-paghe-da-fame-storie-di-ordinario-sfruttamento_516624/?fbclid=IwAR0QMVpN3rVmd1t1xzmadxmd-PQiZ3IK-F8byDsc3NCR4weERr4j3Wk3kSI) \.

**All of the 8 workers were forced to work in the fields for €2\.50 per hour, €25 per day, one third of the minimum wage fixed by law\. On average they worked for 11 hours a day, 6 days a week\.** Those who denounced were heavily insulted and threatened with layoffs\. Needless to say, the workers lived in horrible hygienic conditions and were forced to share accommodation in a large warehouse\-like building\.

Similar stories are to be found all over the country\. In Turin, [two other criminals were arrested](http://www.torinotoday.it/video/lavoro-schiavitu-aglie-montalenghe-cuceglio.html?fbclid=IwAR2hvMiap22-8Y373tVxrza1Gf4golKVW9fDGHAIlT25mXv4Nq36apCuOUw) after authorities found they exploited and secluded factory workers, making them work for 15 hours a day, for €0\.30 per hour, €5 a day\! They had no days off and were constantly monitored by CCTV cameras\.
#### GERMANY

[Authorities rescued 11 people out of a refrigerated truck](https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/passau-elf-fluechtlinge-aus-kuehllaster-befreit-a-1302643-amp.html) on the highway around Passau, at the border with Austria\. They were already suffering from breathlessness and presenting other breathing difficulties\. Apparently, they entered the truck in Serbia\.

The group, aged between 14 and 31, was handed over to German authorities\.
