### Feature

[Info Park](https://www.facebook.com/infoparkserbia/) Belgrade noted a significant increase in the number of people staying in the open air\. Many are in the area of so\-called “Afghani Park”, across from the main Belgrade bus station\. Some refuse to enter one of the 19 camps in Serbia, hoping to be able to continue their journey soon\.

On the occasion of the daily headcount, the field team came across 365 individuals on Tuesday\.

In general, the number of people who are in the Balkans, moving toward the EU, is growing every day\. The EU is trying to find a way to prevent them from moving, while the help that is arriving in the Balkans countries is more often connected to security issues and border control, than to humanitarian assistance\.

The latest news coming from Bosnia — where most of the people who arrive in Serbia are going— is that the authorities are planning to close the 600 km long borders with Serbia and Montenegro, in order to prevent people from entering its territory, [reports](https://www.slobodnaevropa.org/a/bih-madjarska-migranti/29817126.html?fbclid=IwAR1qH4oyNRFlRE1Ipumlqupn-JDlEmM1ZRmTg9KNF8yEUWRYP3_Q_yGjseU) Slobodna Evropa\.

Help for this is offered from Hungary, which according [to N1INFO announced](http://ba.n1info.com/documents/1297893/comments/NEWS/Hungarian-Foreign-Minister-proposed-their-police-assist-Bosnian-Border-Police.html?fbclid=IwAR3LnNcJ534T1RGY6k_kbIgdcHtD2PT5WRnm9I3Btced4L9Uz-MnZljkFrs) the possibility of sending 60 border police officers \( [we reported on this already](https://medium.com/are-you-syrious/ays-daily-digest-5-3-19-todays-europe-criminalizes-human-rights-defenders-20-years-for-saving-587e177edbcf?fbclid=IwAR0ymjoc3Wvvmrv8JqgRWiWA7nQurdV4efEDhXvYi_Q2LmoZZJdv_Ahwelo) \) \. The Bosnian authorities are claiming not to have enough police officers to secure the borders, so the authorities are not excluding the possibility of erecting wire at some parts, as Hungary did\.

The authorities also sent Frontex a request for help\. However, the state government has to vote on this, but at the moment, Bosnia does not have a state government since a new government was not formed after the elections in October 2018, and it is impossible to predict when this process of forming the government might be completed\.

The latest [Amnesty International report](https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/EUR0599642019ENGLISH.PDF) on border violence gives a lot of space to Bosnia and the situation in the country\.

_“The lack of clear institutional responsibility for managing the growing humanitarian crisis raises serious concerns; not only do temporary, and often opaque, informal arrangements between the authorities and international organizations create a situation where no one institution is fully responsible for providing a plausible explanation for inaction, but they also diminish any sense of accountability on either side\.”_
### Italy

Between 1 and 10 March, 74 people arrived in Italy, 336 since the beginning of the year\. One hundred fifty people were reported dead or missing\.

### Croatia

Reacting vaguely to the [Amnesty International report](ays-daily-digest-12-3-19-amnesty-international-demanding-accountability-from-croatian-government-b090fb89091a) on the border violence perpetrated by the Croatian authorities, the European Commission spokesperson Mina Andreeva said they are “ _as always concerned about reports of mistreatment of migrants and refugees”_ \.

They expect Croatia to follow up on the allegations and will continue to monitor the situation \(whatever that means\) \. The full statement can be found [here](https://ec.europa.eu/avservices/video/player.cfm?sitelang=en&ref=I169361&fbclid=IwAR3nwtu2vBaNiqnkI8VNg0VQAnjmzK9uaqJEYA-RjbiKNwkv_XZIUEG3BlY) , although it is not really worth seeing or hearing\. Find the amnesty report on violence and abuse against refugees and migrants along the Balkan route [here](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur05/9964/2019/en/?fbclid=IwAR19YRs0iAf_0maldHBbbeQzIdVHEWYxsWi4P6bv4FxvTYXKJ9kf_DxN9BA) \.
### Denmark

The TV2 station in Denmark [released](http://nyheder.tv2.dk/samfund/2019-03-13-selvmordstruet-mand-var-for-syg-til-ellebaek-nu-er-han-tvangsudsendt-til?fbclid=IwAR1PfZxnJvwHzsVX7jh5WBqj18nV1AMnoXzkaExFz3mthBURfIgcBgQp7eM) another video from the detention center in Ellebæk\. This time, they interview young Afghan Farid Faisi, who in spite of serous psychological disorders, has been deported by force to Kabul\.

### General

IOM [published](https://displacement.iom.int/system/tdf/reports/20190308_IOM_DTM_FMS_IWD.pdf?file=1&type=node&id=5296&fbclid=IwAR1pjEnSiZpRC7oJ58cQBgiB6UphR8W5Uv9ZnyfGstGnySQ2Y3b9sUM-IGw) a new report about displaced women\. In 2018, the organization interviewed more than 16,000 people, mainly in Africa and the Middle East\. In all the regions covered, the biggest age group is between 26 and 35\. The main departure countries are:
- Middle East: Syria \(39%\), Yemen \(23%\), Iraq \(13%\)
- North Africa: Sudan \(53%\), Egypt \(26%\), Morocco \(9%\)
- West and Central Africa: Nigeria \(32%\), Guinea \(20%\)
- East and Horn of Africa: Ethiopia \(60%\), Somalia \(16%\), Sudan \(10%\)


Worth noting is that only most of the women interviewed from the Middle East said that their intended destination is a European country \(30%\) \. Most of the women from African countries said they want to migrate within the continent\. At 46%, almost as many women as men are leaving the East and Horn of Africa — in all of the other regions covered, their percentage is less than 20%\.

In another [survey](https://reliefweb.int/report/spain/profile-and-reported-vulnerabilities-migrants-along-western-mediterranean-route?fbclid=IwAR2VHtl1_NXfs9ljf8GvBlFl-7njXo0ZkeyZz1KnRDqxSSlgv0GfA_3DX9M) of the 1300 people arriving in Spain via the western Mediterranean route, 48% percent of the people interviewed reported having “at least one immediate experience related to human trafficking, exploitation or abuse while traveling on the Western Mediterranean Route\.” Especially people from Cameroon, Gambia and Guinea reported immediate experiences\. Also almost half of the people said they had been robbed at least once during their journey\.
