### Alarm Phone reports of a pushback they believe to be taking place this afternoon

At roughly 5pm Greek time, the GPS position of the boat showed that it had moved closer to Turkey, after the boat had been in contact with the Hellenic Coast Guard\.

#### SERBIA & HUNGARY
### Serbia has halted visa\-free travel from Tunisia and Burundi

After weeks of pressure from the EU, Serbia’s foreign minister notified the Tunisian embassy of this decision, which will come into effect on 20th November\.

The European Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement congratulated Serbia on the fact they have implemented a rule that fits with the EU’s perspective and approach to visa required third countries\.

This comes after weeks of EU\-fronted accusations that Belgrade has been directly pushing the rise in the number of migrants entering the EU due to Serbia’s visa\-free regulations with certain countries in Asia and Africa\. The idea is that often migrants enter Serbia and are then smuggled into neighbouring countries within the EU\.

#### ITALY
### Between 25th and 26th October, more than 1100 individuals were rescued in the Mediterranean

The first rescue, by Diciotti, saved 416 individuals, whilst the second rescue, by the Italian Coast Guard, saved 663 individuals\.

Alarm Phone alerted the authorities about both boats\. According to their figures, they believe the number of individuals saved is as many as 1300\.

We were alerted by a large wooden boat that left #Tobruk, #Libya, and is now in the SAR zones of #Malta and #Italy. Communication is difficult but we believe we heard they were 700 people on board! We urge authorities: launch a rescue operation!! https://t.co/oqXN5zXjTL

In placing these rescues within the current political context in Italy, the new Interior Minister, Matteo Piantedosi, aims to restrict the movements and activities of NGO ships trying to rescue asylum seekers at sea\. This is obviously a terrifying thought that could take the lives of thousands of individuals trying to seek safety\.

### NGOs and trade unions call for the new government to revoke the 2017 Memorandum between Libya and Italy

This memorandum was implemented to combat irregular migration and human trafficking\.

The Italian government has until 2nd November to issue a suspension before it is automatically renewed for another three years\. It is a very dangerous memorandum, leading to the detention, torture, abuse, and exploitation of thousands of people\.

The collective of NGOs and unions have also questioned the European funds that are financing the Libyan coast guards\.

### An individual who, in desperation, attempted to swim across the Channel was brought back to Calais, suffering from severe hypothermia

A 22\-year\-old Nigerian male attempted to swim across the Channel to reach the UK, with a rucksack on his back\. He was quickly swept back to the beach by the waves, where people walking past alerted the authorities\.

Another individual had previously attempted to do the same thing in September and had been rescued by the local authorities\. A few individuals who had previously succeeded in swimming across the Channel, which is roughly 34 kilometres, had almost all been professional swimmers\.

### Suella Braverman back in office

Ms\. Braverman’s drive to send asylum seekers to Rwanda, to alter human rights and modern slavery laws, and her general disregard for international human rights laws, makes her both a terrifying and an unsuitable candidate for such a powerful position in government\.

### Home Affairs Select Committee held two evidence sessions 26th October regarding Channel crossings
- In 2022, 936 boats, carrying 38,000 people arrived in the UK across the Channel
- There is a very long backlog of asylum applications — only roughly 4% of those who arrive by boat in 2021 have received a decision on their claim
- Manston accommodation centre is currently holding roughly 3000 people, which is 1400 people over capacity\. The centre has had to hire non\-specialist staff to support the high numbers of people, which is highly concerning\.
