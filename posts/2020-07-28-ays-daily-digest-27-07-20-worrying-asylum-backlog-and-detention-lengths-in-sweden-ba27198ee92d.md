### FEATURE: In Sweden backlogged cases, lengthy detention, and lower expected asylum cases due to COVID\-19

In the latest updates on Sweden‚Äôs asylum polices and response under COVID\-19, there remains little good news in regards to the number of cases backlogged, the length of time people are forced to stay in detention, and the number of new asylum cases for 2020\.

**In regards to the [backlog of cases](https://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/allt-farre-migrationsmal-avgors-tusentals-fast-i-asylprocessen?fbclid=IwAR0OdEghomnzPJrk0AO1dKmfm6LbuAyhVVaLq0eokB0MfbER9Y7HwbMP-hA) , it has only increased and thousands of asylum seekers are stuck in the process because of COVID\-19\.** There are around 60 percent less cases being overseen by the four different Migration Courts this year compared to the three previous years\. This means that more than half of the proceedings pending before the Migration Courts have been postponed due to COVID\-19\. Many of the people whose cases are pending, after first being rejected by the Migration Agency, came to Sweden during the fall of 2015 ‚Äî which means that they have been waiting for almost four years at this point, unable to get a real chance to actually restart their lives\.

Swedish media has also just covered [Mustafa Huseini‚Äôs story](https://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/coronapandemin-forsvarar-utvisningar-mustafa-har-varit-inlast-i-fem-manader?fbclid=IwAR0HM3IO6s8pIMF-3ASqBK-EN5cvnQuleG-xNEaOxdWrb19AyXGXV-cGtqg) \(age 20\): he has been locked up in one of the Migration Agency‚Äôs detention facilities for more than five months, waiting to be deported back to Afghanistan\. Some people have been released from the facility, since the Migration agency decreased their total capacity in the detention facilities because of COVID\-19\. But Mustafa‚Äôs story is not unique ‚Äî **Sweden is one of the countries in the EU that allows asylum seekers to be locked up during the longest period of time\.** 6, 7, 9 months ‚Äî this is nothing unusual\.

Finally, news from [the Migration Agency](https://www.migrationsverket.se/Om-Migrationsverket/Pressrum/Nyhetsarkiv/Nyhetsarkiv-2020/2020-07-27-Tydliga-pandemieffekter-i-Migrationsverkets-verksamhet.html?fbclid=IwAR1flI4a_dsc57uTuXMJGRO-y5dTl_doYdWbyAbcGsH0App3J62rf8v0Law) states that **the overall number of applications in 2020 is expected to be 13,000** , down from an estimated 21,000 before the pandemic\. 13,000 asylum seekers/applications is a record low figure: there has not been that few people applying for asylum in Sweden in many, many years ‚Äî 1999 the number was 11,000\.

### 95 rescued people were brought safely to Malta

[AlarmPhone](https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/group-of-95-rescued-migrants-to-be-brought-to-malta.807759) first got the call of a sinking ship on Sunday morning\. The ship was denied rescue for 35 hours and the health condition of those on board is currently unknown\. AlarmPhone has warned that Maltese authorities are regularly dismissive of the hotline‚Äôs attempts to reach out and hang up their calls\. So the struggle continues‚Ä¶

Update provided by [Kerrie Moor](https://www.facebook.com/kerrie.moor/posts/10158378231214544) about the concerning situation that is only growing in Victoria, Athens:


> ‚ÄúThe majority of these families had their asylum cases accepted and were given residency in Greece\. Their cash card assistance were stopped and they were put out of their UNHCR homes\. The numbers are rising daily\. Just to serve them a croissant breakfast we would need ‚Ç¨150 a day\. Plus ‚Ç¨90 for bottles of water\. Organisations are breaking under the pressure here\. We need your support more than ever \. If you can support please inbox to talk about a plan\.‚Äù 




Unfortunately there has been another death in [Moria](https://www.kathimerini.gr/1089584/article/epikairothta/ellada/aimathrh-symplokh-me-enan-nekro-sth-moria) \. A 21 year old man was stabbed to death early on Monday morning over a disagreement\. Another young man has been arrested\. There have now been [6 cases of manslaughter](https://twitter.com/g_christides/status/1287819700592881670?fbclid=IwAR2cd5ZBMAbfc5oK3rOn71YCb_Cw98NxIwv2POrIlvpWU8kIsSDCyL2R8eM) in Moria so far in 2020\. When you put people in cages with little hope, it becomes a recipe for violence\. Free the people in Moria from this dehumanizing, killing cage\.

![Although not present in the mainstream media, thousands still roam around Bosnia and Herzegovina as the officials and international organisations have failed in providing the basic conditions to protect them from a wide range of life threatening circumstances they are forced to go through in a daily basis\. The few field teams and locals report of a large number of people in Velika Kladusa who are left alone in every possible way and sense of the word\. There are no new feasible solutions from any of the stake holders ‚Äúin charge‚Äù of the situation‚Ä¶ Photo by [CBA](https://www.facebook.com/CroatianBaptistAid/posts/1412507968944590)](assets/ba27198ee92d/1*xprXLPaLPI7ATcjpZ2du5w.jpeg)

#### CROATIA

The mainstream media is giving attention to some of the worrying practices along the Croatian border with Bosnia Herzegovina and Serbia, practices that AYS and other on the ground outlets have been reporting on for some time\. [This DW article](https://www.dw.com/hr/nasilje-nad-izbjeglicama-u-hrvatskoj-postaje-sve-raznovrsnije/a-54321929) is bringing to mainstream light important research and advocacy about the torture of refugee children, the increased number of deaths at the border, and other forms of abuse against refugees along Croatia that are no longer receiving much public attention\. Marijana Hamer≈°ak, an anthropologist from the Zagreb Institute of Ethnology and Folklore Research, and a researcher for ‚ÄúEuropean Regime of Irregulated Migration on the Periphery of the EU‚Äù said:


> ‚ÄúEven before the corona\. This can be attributed to the fact that we are facing today, that our media are paying less and less attention to this topic\. It is already ‚Äòchewed‚Äô for them, \[refugees are\] no longer an attractive commodity on the market\.‚Äù 





While the general public is involved with other pressing matters in their day to day life, no one should ever turn their back on torture and police brutality\. We must continue bringing these issues to light, no matter the public ‚Äúappetite‚Äù for such news‚Ä¶
