### Feature

Migration across the Mediterranean is a long\-standing phenomenon\. It is not something new, even though the numbers have increased over the past years, due to conflicts, persecution, proxy wars and the climate crisis\. By 2050 it is estimated that there will be, at least, one billion climate refugees, and people displaced worldwide due to the climate crisis\.

This will be in addition to the 70\.8 million people who are on the move today\.

The panic surrounding migration has probably never been as palpable as it is today\. The EU has, during this time, implemented a number of decisions in order to push their borders further south\. The researchers, [Violeta Moreno\-Lax and Mariagiulia Giuffré](https://www.unhcr.org/events/conferences/5a056ca07/raise-consensual-containment-contactless-control-contactless-responsibility.html) , have described how the EU reached a level of so\-called consensual containment: it has become acceptable to detain people and buy oneself free from responsibility\. The responsibility is nowadays contactless — help is not necessarily provided here, but ‘over there’\.

The European border is today, in fact, on the other side of the Mediterranean Sea\. Suffering, however, has no borders\. The EU has been responsible for the deteriorating situation for years now\. On the initiative of Finland, who currently holds the EU presidency, the EU’s interior ministers met on Wednesday night \(17 July\) and the talks will continue on Thursday \(the 18th\) \. Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos has also been invited to the informal dinner\.

_It is obvious that the situation on the Mediterranean requires our immediate attention\. The Presidency has discussed this issue with certain interested Member States\. Instead of repeated ad hoc efforts to relieve the pressure on frontline Member States, we need robust arrangements to follow up on search and rescue operations by ensuring a swift response after disembarkation and avoiding additional hardships for migrants\. This approach needs to be based on shared responsibility involving a sufficiently large number of Member States,_ [Finnish Minister of the Interior Maria Ohisalo said](https://intermin.fi/sv/artikeln/-/asset_publisher/valimeren-siirtolaistilanne-keskustelun-aiheena-eu-n-sisaministerien-epavirallisella-illallisella?_101_INSTANCE_jyFHKc3on2XC_languageId=en_US&fbclid=IwAR1hf2WqfmsQovgCZ12JqA92cKu28ixJ3blXc2B_DgDgEYFxMvOKXws7o1c) \.

The story about the Mediterranean Sea and the migration to Europe is a long one\. But yet never as politicized as in the recent years\.

[**In 2003**](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3009666.stm) **, BBC** described the first landing point in Europe — Lampedusa\. It is hard, the reporter wrote, to prevent people from arriving\. Every spring when the weather improves the so\-called _voyages of hope_ increase\. In 2002 Italy implemented laws making it easier to deport people\. Umberto Bossi, the founder and then leader of the Northern League, suggested that the Navy should use canons to stop boat migrants\.

**In 2004,** NGO\-captain Stefan Schmidt was arrested: he was the first captain accused of aiding illegal migration, according to [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/05/o-captain-my-captain-sailors-who-risk-jail-to-save-migrants-lives) \. The case was worrying, [according to the UN](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8295727.stm) , as it could scare fishermen from rescuing people they encountered in distress at sea\.

[**In 2008, Italy**](https://www.hrw.org/news/2009/09/23/italy-libya-connection) drew up a friendship agreement with Libya and the Gadaffi regime\. **In May, 2009,** boats were literally stopped at sea and returned to Libya, who said, at the time, that there were “no refugees” in the country — only illegal migrants\. Human Rights Watch \(HRW\) and Amnesty International reacted to this, as it was breaking the principle of non\-refoulement\. The then Italian PM [Silvio Berlusconi said](https://www.hrw.org/news/2009/09/23/italy-libya-connection) that the principle wasn’t applicable on the high seas\.

**In 2012, the** European Court of Human Rights condemned this\. HRW and Amnesty were right and the cruel refoulement policy ended\.

**On 3 October 2013** , the Lampedusa shipwreck occurred which killed more than 360 people\. Italy started _Mare Nostrum_ — a SAR\-operation that saved more than 100,000 people in one year\. This was expensive: €9,000,000 per month, paid by Italy\. When _Mare Nostrum_ was abolished in October 2014, the EU’s _Triton_ took over\. [The budget was a third](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/31/italy-sea-mission-thousands-risk) of _Mare Nostrum’s_ €9,000,000\. In 2019, lawyers Juan Branco and Omer Shatz accused the EU of knowingly creating the deadliest migration route in the world\.

Since _Mare Nostrum_ was shut down, the decisions which criminalize and kill have been many: agreements with Libya, Morrocco, Niger, and non\-EU\-countries in the Balkans have brought **the policies of 2008–2009** to life again\. The message is clear: we don’t want you here\.

**_Our European values are what is drowning there,_** the MEP Erik Marquardt said in the European Parliament on Wednesday, talking about the Mediterranean Sea\.

The speech is available below, with English subtitles\.

### LIBYA

The New York Times earlier analyzed the outrageous and unlawful airstrike on the Tajoura detention center in Tripoli, Libya, on 2 July\. At least 53 people were killed\. [This is](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/reader-center/libya-migrant-center-airstrike-reporting.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share) how the reporters involved collaborated and conducted the investigation\.

Reports about the Tajoura center being rebuilt and filling up again have started to arrive\. The EU is involved, but IOM Libya has said that they \(contrary to this tweet\) [are not involved](https://twitter.com/IOM_Libya/status/1151487971146829827) in the reconstruction following the airstrike\.

### SEA

Watch The Med Alarm Phone was alerted about two boats, which had departed from Nador, Morocco\. There were about 146 people on board the two boats and they were transferred to Spain\. [One woman died on the way\.](https://www.facebook.com/…/a.15261827976…/2410982185842677/…)

The Spanish and Moroccan authorities rescued 277 people over Wednesday night, reports [InfoMigrants](https://twitter.com/InfoMigrants_fr/status/1151552898003800065?fbclid=IwAR3mM6CR0_AkyOeDoJfKLWHRhQ-58oGU32oGHv4R54XXPAphEcKc3VhdbkE) \.

[A total of 142 departures](https://twitter.com/InfoMigrants_fr/status/1151552898003800065?fbclid=IwAR3mM6CR0_AkyOeDoJfKLWHRhQ-58oGU32oGHv4R54XXPAphEcKc3VhdbkE) from Tunisia as of 30 June\. In total, 1266 people were stopped\. It is not clear how many boats they were traveling on\.

### GREECE

KEERFA \(The Movement Against Racism and the Fascist Threat\) strongly condemns new Labor Minister Yiannis Vroutsis’s decision to revoke the new National Health Insurance law, which Syriza decided to implement on 20 June\. Minister Yiannis Vroutsis has already been labeled “heartless and inhumane”, reports Greek news outlet [ANSAmed](http://www.ansamed.info/ansamed/en/news/sections/politics/2019/07/17/greece-labor-minister-criticized-for-racist-refugees-move_2d97ce3d-b02d-4b09-9c53-420cccf89e0e.html?fbclid=IwAR3XNcMtR2gpAyLd0g9f6_e0GAeoiO4hyybvk8kbaqYeGF83uk45makb6N0) \.

According to KEERFA, his decision directly targets poor, marginalized people and refugees\. The new law would have given everyone the right to free health care, regardless of how much money they had and the passport they carried\. It is a racist attack, claims KEERFA , and an act against the solidarity movement in Greece\. More reading [here](http://www.ansamed.info/ansamed/en/news/sections/politics/2019/07/17/greece-labor-minister-criticized-for-racist-refugees-move_2d97ce3d-b02d-4b09-9c53-420cccf89e0e.html?fbclid=IwAR3XNcMtR2gpAyLd0g9f6_e0GAeoiO4hyybvk8kbaqYeGF83uk45makb6N0) and [here](https://anexsartitos.blogspot.com/2019/07/blog-post_45.html) , the second report with more details in Greek\.

[Efsyn](https://www.efsyn.gr/.../204022_kataggelia-katoikon-ton...) also reports that the police presence in the Exarchia neighborhood in Athens, where a lot of refugees and activists live and hang out, will increase\.
#### Islands

Six people involved in smuggling people were arrested in **Kos** on 12 July\. The criminal group supposedly assisted illegal exits from Greece and further to other European Union countries, writes [Ekathimerini](http://www.ekathimerini.com/.../six-arrested-in-kos-in...) \. The group of six consisted of four Greeks and two other nationals\. According to [Keep Talking Greece](https://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2019/07/17/samos-hospital-kos-airport-refugees-arrests/) , one of the arrested was a 36\-year old and the head of the gang, and another of the arrested people was a police officer working at the airport\. He, of course, played a key role in the business\.

[In **Samos**](https://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2019/07/17/samos-hospital-kos-airport-refugees-arrests/) , several doctors and nurses are suspected of having issued false medical paper for people in order to place them in _vulnerable categories_ which would make them eligible for programs that transfer them to the mainland\. As the islands are like prisons for the innocent, it is not surprising that people who can pay will bargain their way out of there\. Medical staff who take advantage of the vulnerability of others are under criticism\. The arrests happened at the Hospital of Samos on Wednesday morning\. No official statement from the Greek Police is yet available, but the fake medical reports are reported to have been available in exchange for money\.

[Refugee Support Aegean](https://twitter.com/rspaegean/status/1151550678579470338) reports similar numbers\.

### BOSNIA

Since January 2018, nearly 36,000 people on the move arrived and were registered in Bosnia\. It is now estimated that 7400 people are residing in the country, of whom 4100 are staying in EU\-funded accommodations\. During the same period of time, Bosnia and Herzegovina received €24,000,000\.

The EU today, 17 July, met and discussed the migratory challenges facing Bosnia and how to respond to them\. According to the text released after the _Bosnia and Herzegovina High Level Meeting on Migration,_ the European Commission \(EC\) [welcomes the commitment](http://europa.ba/?p=64769&fbclid=IwAR0e88qtWk5BVJwwEsVHLuWFlZX9eqcQ9ZBD_8LNN52NnpCI86ft3czc2lI) of Bosnia and Herzegovina authorities to strengthen their **coordination** in managing migration\. In this context, the Commission will provide a senior expert to support the relevant coordination structures\.

At the same, the EC [regrets that Bosnia](http://europa.ba/?p=64769&fbclid=IwAR0e88qtWk5BVJwwEsVHLuWFlZX9eqcQ9ZBD_8LNN52NnpCI86ft3czc2lI) and Herzegovina has not proposed suitable locations for additional **reception facilities** , in spite of the Commission’s readiness to provide the necessary financial support\. The Commission urges Bosnia and Herzegovina authorities to identify suitable facilities with no further delay\.

In other news, not much news was provided\. The conditions for refugees and migrants in BH are far below minimum standards\. The meeting also paid some attention to the upcoming winter — where the needs, once again, will be even greater than during the summer months\.

Moreover, local volunteers in Tuzla still cover the gaps\. This morning more new arrivals were recorded, as you can see below\.

Salvini is closing his country’s southern ports, people continue to arrive in Italy via Slovenia and the Balkan route, as [**L’ ALTRA VOCE**](https://www.facebook.com/L-ALTRA-VOCE-1245970425495921/?__tn__=kC-R&eid=ARBmxXlDEyRGOM2jWKKj_LscDhqUaH5ItZ3TNRMDaltK-LM7lhCHpn7EliuEDMiayKy0P1VUHRuhsQn-&hc_ref=ARRgg5ne_iOkaHyMMVgTJWijhDadYUBh0BzVS8SOlp3JOE9MfBuOXzRI3azoiGjRjyE&fref=nf&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARCO8TUuvCWHpU4gyzS7RwfAcsmIyJMTeDXawp08JgG8-FnvtV4Ol-NxrLxvFPDIGy0bbz1Z5-oQXYm1c5irtPS-pldJEjtnj6UBJqQkeXfGJtkp7mbi-y7q40QQ9mFvdoIMk_HmoMg7ce_ZjSvk0TUtwTrSqORq6i5LpLElL5t-mysiMycC-cxuKlj0v6Q_HBacT8rxTIwWp-Jvk-f1Zrwdm3soeUnEduqgBRPhs1ZcVYzhHFeqQlg8PIfdkGK_owBisRuAEndT2YDCm-qt6tX0udFKQK2sT1MUGpSM2sDb-VB8X9969q12uJfv_mWS1rE3He6CXjPBUQ9AM8xzUxPgTHyh) **says** \. More information in Italian here\. [Money\.it](https://www.money.it/immigrazione-Italia-2019-arrivi-raddoppiati-rotta-balcanica) writes that the only immigration emergency in the country right now is in the northeastern city of **Trieste** , where the reception facility is working over its limits, with 1300 people, and [the arrivals continue\.](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=2352083498217936&id=1245970425495921&hc_location=ufi)

Salvini therefore reacted and said that people soon will be moved from this reception center, Friuli Venezia Giulia, and taken to other areas\. [According to some reports](http://www.vita.it/it/article/2019/07/17/legacoopsociali-salvini-deporta-2mila-migranti-dal-friuli-venezia-giul/152268?fbclid=IwAR1PGngg-GaidcJL2Qd5izv4MaKpkq3oaMPp34bOwxasnUFbkK1vPzDNpXA) , Salvini wants to create large scale structures, very likely detention camps, and private actors could be appointed to run these facilities\. In Udine, the number of arrivals from the Balkan route has also increased: there are now 400 people at the Cavarzerani camp, up from 270 a few weeks ago\. Transfers will begin soon and people will not be able to choose where to go\. There are 150 people accommodated in Gorizia, and the situation is reported to be under control\.

Despite this, the media coverage is focusing on the Med\. In total, 30 refugees were found in Bagnoli della Rosandra and Dolina near the Slovenian border on Wednesday\. [They all applied for](http://www.vita.it/it/article/2019/07/17/legacoopsociali-salvini-deporta-2mila-migranti-dal-friuli-venezia-giul/152268?fbclid=IwAR1PGngg-GaidcJL2Qd5izv4MaKpkq3oaMPp34bOwxasnUFbkK1vPzDNpXA) international protection\.

### SWEDEN

The sit\-in continues but the families need support\. An activist spoken to by the paper Arbetaren said she was disappointed in the public for their lack of response\.

The young Saleh Nasri gave a speech to the media covering the strike and anyone willing to listen \(Saleh Nasri speaks in Swedish\) \. He explains that he never chose to become a refugee, that Ashraf Ghani is using them as pawns\. He pleas Sweden to let him and his friends, thousands of brothers and sisters, stay there in safety\. When Saleh Nasri grows up he wants to become some sort of artist and he has been in Sweden for four years now:
