### AYS News Digest 26–27/10/19: Riots and incidents scratching the surface of a well funded degrading ‘reception’ system
#### Protests in Libya, and aftermath of the riot in Malta, poor reception conditions of people far from anyone’s sight / SAR teams attacked from the Libyan side, people in distress ignored by the EU member states CG again / Solidarity call in Paris / & other info

#### FEATURED

As reported multiple times, the EU seems to be punishing Search and Rescue \(SAR\) teams with lengthy standoffs if they enter or in any way “meddle” with the Libyan SAR, like the rescue ship, Alan Kurdi, which asked Italy for a safe port\. Malta has now reportedly accepted to take the people rescued by the Open Arms after refusing to take part in the SAR\.

What would have happened if #OpenArms had not been at sea? How many lives would have been lost only this year, without the civil rescue fleet?

The recent events and riots only spark more interest for a system that is just as fallible\. According to the most recent report on the situation of people who arrived to Malta, there does not seem to be a contingency plan for situations of severe over\-crowding of some of the poorly maintained and geographically isolated camps across the island state\. The total reception capacity of the island’s centres was approximately 1,500 places\. Multiple sources AYS spoke to on Malta, as well as [media](https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/rats-and-cramped-conditions-life-inside-the-hal-far-open-centre.744333?fbclid=IwAR12d0gq6EA-AyiGWZJEJxZyHKbA2BViGe9JEN2s3MlnMzIZvSs_h8ho5BI) claim these numbers were reached way back and are now under capacity\. Due to a slow asylum system, it is uncertain that there will be any improvements soon\. In the past three years, just 4 in 10 international protection requests received positive answers from the officials in Malta\. The rest of the people fall under the radar of the big international agencies as their fates then lie in the hands of the police immigration sector, they are placed in detention or sent away as rejected asylum seekers\. Plenty of people can be seen roaming around desolate wild construction sites across the country, but most are trapped within the health hazard centres for asylum seekers in Malta\.

A small food and transport allowance, free access to state health services and in cases of children under 16, free access to state education services, is what people staying in the open centres are entitled to officially\. However, poor hygiene, severe overcrowding and rat and cockroach infestations are only some of the issues mentioned when talking about ‘centres’, especially the Ħal Far\.

A number of people who were charged over their involvement in a riot at Ħal Far last week were reportedly manhandled, packed like sardines in a cell, locked up all day and humiliated, the Maltese media also reported\.

The local organisations working with refugees and people on the move urged the police to investigate since, if confirmed, these allegations amount to very serious hate crimes\.
#### LIBYA

People at the the UNHCR\-run Gathering and Departure Facility \(GDF\) in Libya held another demonstration on Sunday, pleading for the international community to help them\. One of the activists writes:

“The people spent a week sleeping outside the rubble of the bombed detention center for a week without aid before taking their fate into their own hands\. The group walked 14 hours to Tripoli, to reach the GDF and ask for help\.

They were given temporary shelter by UNHCR, but have now been told that the facility is overcrowded and evacuation spaces are too limited\. They are facing imminent eviction into the city, where they fear they will be vulnerable to conflict, poverty and human trafficking\.

The group has been through this before, many were living in the city before being captured by traffickers and imprisoned\. They expect the same thing will happen once again, and are asking the international community to intervene and provide safe alternatives\. Governments must step up and provide spaces for evacuation, and support for local protection, health, shelter and more\.”
#### TURKEY

As a continuation of poor EU\-Turkey policies, Turkey is now officially ‘threatening’ to let the refugees currently staying in the country leave freely towards Europe if the EU fails to support their intentions\. A large number of the estimated 3\.6 million Syrians in Turkey would be sent back to Syria, despite protests from human rights groups and many others who keep saying the people would thus be forcibly returned to war\.

While the Ocean Viking is without a port to land for the 5th consecutive day, a boat with 10 people on board arrived at the hot spot in Lampedusa\.
#### GREECE

So far this month a staggering 670 boats have started towards the Greek Aegean Islands, carrying 22,962 people, and only 32% have arrived\. The rest, 68%, have been stopped by Turkish Coast Guard and police, ABR reports\.

Resisting the newly imposed health system decisions, the No Borders collective wrote:


> Repression experiments on immigrant s’ bodies and transactions of millions of euros through Ngos complete the big picture of capitalism\. Everyone has to gain something of the above, except for the subjects who suffer abuse, abuse of all kinds and often death itself, when to escape the bombs, hunger, and devastation in their country they are drowning in the Aegean, they are shot at the border Mexico or chars due to the poor living conditions in the detention centres of the Greek territory\. Divisions in refugees and immigrants are used by the governments to determine who will be legal or illegal and to prevent the destruction of the latter\. But it is often enough to look at the reality and the political, political or legal terms are being held: no man starts an attempt to approach another country at risk of his life if he is not already in danger of war or economic poverty and poor living conditions \. 





> Immigrants are not images in the news or numbers in statistics\. They live with us, we live with them\. Hospitals are another place where immigration is reflected in material terms and is related to the lives of those who work there\. With this text we declare our solidarity with medical staff and employees, recognizing the difficult work they do despite the wild working conditions in abandoned and abandoned public hospitals\. At the same time, we urge them to resist the new racist provisions that make it difficult to access the health care of those immigrants / refugees who do not have social security numbers\. To abolish racism in practice, in the areas of work and education, in the streets and squares, all over the public sphere\.

#### FRANCE
### From this Monday on — support for Landy Sauvage\!

Volunteers in Paris are calling for solidarity and support as the [Landy Sauvage](https://www.facebook.com/clossauvage/) expects eviction in the coming days\. It is a place in the northern part of Paris, in Saint\-Denis, a space for individuals, associations and collectives from the area and abroad\. It hosts creative and sport activities, all the while offering support and help for those without a place to stay, or refugees from the Île\-de\-France area\. It hosts about 60 people of different origin, among them also children\.

The owner of the land, l’Établissement Public Foncier d’Ile\-de\-France, have launched a procedure that leads to the eviction of Landy Sauvage\.

The group is now asking everyone who is willing to help to write to landysauvage@riseup\.net and leave their phone numbers and contacts for further notice and actions\. On the evening of Monday, October 28, the idea is to gather in a large number\. Follow their page for updates and more info, or better yet, write them to see what you can do\. The address is:
166 rue du Landy — 93200 Saint\-Denis\.

During the weekend, Cedric Herrou has been [arrested and detained](https://www.facebook.com/EmmausRoya/photos/a.2062593667353035/2501845670094497/?type=3&__xts__[0]=68.ARAOP_vdK6kf1n_9y7XTs3yB2dvMKZzyySJ7Yu4SCFf5r0Ieqjb5JLo9GkBHrUNT8x9Db1x-tPlttCvOK_O4CrGFI6tTFRpDtAo0w4pfR9kUaludXhrdvdW4WOhkZ_vtNVltRXdA82NXQ1HpB_1E1Qh1nBqu7k6u7n5kT_fcZkfCqp3OBqmoVjdSkAD1qyVSqeN5jM60QfZis8l7oodS2HKJuJVGEZ57e52DwjtKX7wt8TgA53XKld6kYPi66VTUPqrETCcY5orEAFMcuNA3cG0m0qFNgbP715-R3_K5qqGOcd_VsLVtzWE0RuVAs_33z0LFFfaQFujjWJh1wHerCFtOx5vAxO7ebB-23lZ1Jd4bXgc9GTMbFCjDQQ&__tn__=-R&hc_location=ufi) again, but later on, he was [released](https://www.facebook.com/CedricHerrou/posts/2259626827615203?hc_location=ufi) and acquitted of all charges\.
