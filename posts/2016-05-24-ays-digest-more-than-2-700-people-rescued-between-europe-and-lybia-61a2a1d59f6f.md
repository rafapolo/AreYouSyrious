> Until year ago, the Mediterranean Sea was one of the most prominent routes for refugees trying to reach Europe\. It is estimated that 23,000 refugees lost their lives between 2000 and 2014\. In the first month of 2016, nearly 250 people have died or gone missing\. 




#### Syria
### Fabric of Life by Khaled Barakeh visually documents daily life in Syria\.


> It has been five years since the war began in Syria\. More that 250,000 people have been killed so far in this war, while almost 11 million people have fled their homes\. The Assad government currently controls the capital, Damascus, parts of southern Syria, portions of Aleppo and Deir Az Zor, much of the area near the Syrian\-Lebanese border, and the northwestern coastal region\. Rebel groups, ISIL, and Kurdish forces control the rest of the country\. Rebel groups often fight against one another\. The war has profound effects on Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan where huge number of refugees have settled\. Several rounds of peace talks have failed to stop the fighting\. The Last ceasefire was negotiated in February, but it has only limited fighting in some parts of Syria\. Many people are still forced to live in cities under siege via constant bombardment\. Pictures from the streets of Syrian cities remind one of the Sarajevo siege from 1992 to 1995, as well as the international intervention to stop the war\. [Khaled Barakeh](https://www.facebook.com/khaledbarakeh) , an artist living in Germany, has gathered images of life here into a collection entitled Fabric of Life\.

#### Greece

**2000 or so people so far evicted from Idomeni\.**


> After an MSF doctor finished her shift in Idomeni today, she stated “What struck me the most were the blank faces\. People looked like they had lost all hope”\. She was referring to people who were evicted today from the camp where some of them have lived for over three months\. They were hoping the border would open and that they would have freedom of movement\. 





> Early in the morning, police arrived with buses and bulldogs, and eviction began\. Before the evening, about 2,000 people were taken to other camps from Idomeni\. Relocation will continue tomorrow and it should be finished by the end of this month\. Unfortunately, people are being relocated to camps where living conditions are unbearable\.

### Journalists banned from Idomeni\.


> The Greek government decided to ban journalists from the camp during the eviction and relocation of camp residents\. Police prevented refugees and volunteers who were inside of the camp from taking pictures\. The opposition party New Democracy has slammed this government decision\. 





> “A six\-kilometer cut\-off is being applied in Idomeni,” the spokesman for the conservative party, Giorgos Koumoutsakos said, commenting on restrictions to all media staff\. 





> “This is a censorship operation that harms the freedom of the press and exposes the country internationally” Koumoutsakos said\. “When there is rule of law, the government should have nothing to fear from free public information”\. 





**29 new arrivals at Greek islands\.**


> 29 new arrivals were registered today in Greece, all at the islands\. According to government sources, there are 54, 124 refugees in Greece now\. Before the relocation at Idomeni, 8,199 were inside the camp\. 




### Strikes in ports and in Athens


> Piraeus Port Organization \(OLP\) and Thessaloniki Port Organization \(OLTH\) employees announced a strike that will take place beginning Thursday, May 26th\. They are protesting against the privatization of the ports\. Sea transport will be heavily affected\. 





> The strike was announced from the Athens public transport system and it will take place for several hours after 11:00 in the morning on Thursday\. Athens’ trams and lines 1, 2 and 3 on the Athens metro system will not be running from 11:00 until 16:00 in the afternoon, while buses and trolleys will not be running between 11:00 and 17:00\. Public transport workers object to the inclusion of the public transport companies in the new privatization fund, opposing the prospect of privatization, and have called meetings to decide their response\. 




#### Czech
### Refugee shelter eviction


> Police in Prague made another attempt to evict people who are squatting at Klinika center, including several refugees\. From Klinika Twitter we learned how riot police came claimed the presence of a bomb in the building\. However, the bomb was not found, but the police entered the center forcibly\. Apparently some people were arrested\. Activist living inside are calling for help\. Follow their twitter account @centrum\_klinika\. 





> The same center was attacked several times this year\. In February, a group of people threw Molotov cocktails at the building\. The attack took place just hours after thousands of people rallied in Prague against Muslims and immigration\. Activists who work at the center said the attackers were neo\-Nazis\.
