Journalist Meron Estefanos has been in contact with refugees in Libya in both ‘legal’ and illegal detention and in smugglers connection houses\. People are being held hostage by both smugglers and militias in illegal detention\. But even in ‘legal’ detention conditions are bad\. Many people pay smugglers to enter them and then struggle to get registered by UNHCR\.

In one illegal detention building, people have been imprisoned for 8 weeks since they were ‘arrested’ near Sebratha\. Now the militia is demanding that they get paid $3600 per person to take them to the legal detention\. Other have been asked to pay as much as $5500 each and most of them have paid the ransom 4 or 5 times with no result\.

Refugees staying at a smugglers connection house, who have already paid for the sea trip, are also being asked to pay $3600 each just to be taken to the legal detention\. Refugees held hostage by the smugglers report being tortured, starved and raped\. People are desperate and families don’t know what to do\.

Reports from [L’Espresso](https://twitter.com/mannocchia/status/939794324899975168) also confirm the continuing mistreatment of refugees in Libya\.


> After they caught me in the sea I have been moved in three different prisons, the first was in Tripoli\. Then one night a group of armed boys came in\. They took me and fifty other people by force and took us to a shed where we stayed for weeks\. They beat us every day, we did not have enough water or food, they treated us like animals\. We are not human beings for them, we are objects\. Less than objects\. Our life has no value, blacks are used to be sold or blackmailed\. Now we are here but anyone can come in, take us away and ask our families for money to free us\. The value of men is two thousand dinars, women three thousand\. Pregnant women up to four thousand\. 





Yet, this week the Libyan coastguard have continued to intercept boats and return people to these conditions against their will\. Italy continues to support them\. On Human Rights Day we would like to ask — When will the EU stop contributing to human slavery?

#### Distress call from Pampiraki warehouse in Ellinikon, Athens

Pampiraki warehouse supply all squats, mainland camps, the islands, families in apartments, the Athens homeless, etc\.

Chris, a long term volunteer of the [Refugee Community Kitchen](https://web.facebook.com/refugeeCkitchen/) in Calais wrote a first hand account on the situation with the temperatures dropping rapidly:


> People burn anything they can to keep warm: bags, tyres, old broken trainers\. Everyone huddles round the toxic fumes or packs inside our van for a few hours of warmth\. Red raw eyes and cold hands greet us every day\. My friend\. Oror\. Hey bro\. Salam aleikum\. Akkun negar\. Ça va? Choni bashi\. Manana\. I don’t know how people keep smiling\. Or why\.
