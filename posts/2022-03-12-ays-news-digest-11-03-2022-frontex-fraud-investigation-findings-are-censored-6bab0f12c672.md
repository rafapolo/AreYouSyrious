_Death of young man in Tripoli // Safe Port needed for 111 people on GeoBarents // Oligarchs yachts for Sea Rescue // Children locked out of Church in Cyprus // Greece in numbers // Racism persists at Danish border // The continued deterioration of asylum in the UK, if you live long enough to claim it, and much more…_

#### FEATURE: Frontex expansion continues unchecked while fraud investigation findings are censored

[Statewatch reports](https://www.statewatch.org/news/2022/march/frontex-to-boost-border-control-efforts-in-niger-algeria-and-libya/?fbclid=IwAR1pf3uNJDVhrpzpm-9YWtitlIWDfQNgg54gAdwrmSL5PAqnXyFOf48Cigk) that an [**action file**](https://www.statewatch.org/media/3157/mocadem_niger.pdf) \(pdf\) produced as part of the MOCADEM \( _Mécanisme opérationnel de coordination des actions pour la dimension externe des migrations\)_ structure within the Council of Europe, outlines aims to strengthen Frontex’s action in Niger via its liaison officer and by finalising working arrangements with the Common Security and Defence Policy \(CSDP\) missions EUCAP Sahel Niger and EUBAM Libya\.


> These agreements will define Frontex’s role in the facilitation of border control activity in the south of Libya \(alongside Italy and the International Organization for Migration, IOM\), as well as in intensifying patrols of the borders with Algeria and Libya\. The finalisation of the working agreements will be worked out by Frontex, the European External Action Service, and the European Commission\. 





As we previously reported, on February 14, the EU also [confirmed](https://euobserver.com/migration/154357) that [Senegal’s interior minister had given the “green light for technical discussions,”](https://ecre.org/frontex-meps-urge-release-of-eu-anti-fraud-investigation-frontex-to-increase-manpower-at-ukrainian-border-green-light-for-talks-on-senegal-deployment/) potentially leading to the first deployment of armed European border and coastguard forces beyond Europe\.

Frontex has also deployed staff to Moldova and Romania since people began fleeing Ukraine while helpfully offering to fly non\-Ukrainian nationals back to their countries of origin\. Of those who are Ukrainian nationals however:


> Over 250,000 **people** have fled the war in Ukraine and **sought safety** in Moldova\. — [_EU Commission Press Release_](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/mex_22_1664) 





Note the use of language\.

[Approximately 100,000 people have remained in Moldova so far\.](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/odr/moldova-humanitarian-crisis-ukraine-russia/?fbclid=IwAR2zUdA0MXJ4mABfj5sc3NyOAD8pjlSrtfmX_fiXeJ70V53Vxe4MtaoKg9g) Government camps are reportedly 75% full and it has already become impossible to find rental accommodation\. Once again the EU has sent border guards to a humanitarian crisis as if this is in itself an answer\.

Meanwhile, the European Anti\-Fraud Office’s year long investigation of the EU’s largest agency — it has a budget of 750 million euros in 2022 — has come to an end\. The findings of it are reportedly so “ [sensitive](https://twitter.com/g_christides/status/1498526722148470786) ” that access has been limited to the Frontex Management Board members, and to a closed meeting of selected MEPs\.

LIBYA
#### Death of young man in Tripoli

[A young man known as Abdo has died](https://twitter.com/KakaFurAndi/status/1502506929104510976) from burns inflicted by smugglers in Libya\. The original attack took place five months ago when he was admitted to Tripoli Central Hospital\. The burns covered 70% of his body and he was kept alive by friends donating blood to him\. He was released from hospital on the 25th of February and although UNHCR were notified they did not support him\. He was originally from Darfur, a region which has been at war since 2003\. He was 18 years old\.

SEA
#### Safe port needed for GeoBarents

[MSF are asking for a safe port](https://twitter.com/MSF_Prensa/status/1502343645869056001) to disembark the 111 people rescued last weekend\. Among them there are 52 minors, the youngest of only 4 months\. 90% of these minors are travelling alone\. The authorities of Italy and Malta have been informed of the vulnerability of those on board and their medical problems but do nothing\.
#### Safe port for Open Arms

After a week with 28 people on board, [Italy has assigned Open Arms the port of August](https://twitter.com/openarms_fund/status/1502358600911663104?s=20&t=3OlOX1IfU3-5Wsqp4KM39A&fbclid=IwAR0cIm0vn4QnXsA0mhsRsk3eo_OJAVMqMUS1bLOYqKJlTiFaeTvyBmfUxMk) a in Sicily for disembarkation\.


> Hopefully Europe treats them with the justice they deserve\. Their escape trip has been hell\.

[![]()](https://sea-watch.org/en/airborne-monthly-factsheet-december-2021-january-2022/)

#### Oligarch’s boats for Sea Rescue

The Prime Minister of the German state of Thuringia, [Bodo Ramelow, has stated to the press](https://www.presseportal.de/pm/9377/5166157?fbclid=IwAR1rajVUu9FHYBi_S2hldBXZ_kV-wt8h2Rm58_C5Yw8sb01tdiFqlOhLrtM) that he is in favour of expropriating the yachts of Russian oligarchs and using them for sea rescues\.


> Yes, I like to say: I am in favour of collecting the oligarchs’ luxury yachts and transferring them to Sea\-Watch\. 





GREECE
#### Greece in numbers

[711 people](https://rsaegean.org/en/asylum-statistics-2021/?fbclid=IwAR0Pws6QLbIMITVmeMCZt2Trpwt0abX3uwPHrncOdaOtKbKOe1-T9orZBY4) will not have their first asylum interview until 2024\.

1\.5 per 10,000 inhabitants — Greece gives out less work permits to non\-EU citizens than any other country in the block\.


■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 
> **[Vassilis Tsarnas](https://twitter.com/VassilisTsarnas) @ Twitter Says:** 

> > "#Greece is the last country in the EU in terms of the number of #immigration work permits issued to non-EU citizens, compared to the population: 1.5 permits per 10,000 inhabitants.. the EU average [is] almost 13. A paradox called institutional #racism".

■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 


[948 convictions have been handed down to Greece from the European Court of Human Rights](https://twitter.com/EleniKonstanto/status/1502344781409796103?s=20&t=3OlOX1IfU3-5Wsqp4KM39A&fbclid=IwAR0OVxQZh9dJ033BadLvzTeA3sdcgxL-FcXC8m7nss-ES-CR6ZDLTtaD230) , and the country has paid €28,256,237 for these convictions\. There are 2,214 individual appeals still pending\.

[0\.68% of “automatic reviews” by Greece](https://twitter.com/MinosMouz/status/1502306683703508996?s=20&t=3OlOX1IfU3-5Wsqp4KM39A&fbclid=IwAR0t2TcSFiLB0tV1yr-n9HCt6uqOErIbpTKU9OQKU0u38JSTbLYGoahtfmA) quashed immigration detention orders last year\. Not even one percent\.

[20 estimated _masafarhánas_ are currently operating in Athens](https://wearesolomon.com/mag/on-the-move/masafarhana-inside-the-invisible-refugee-houses-in-athens/?fbclid=IwAR1SCnWbOb0OD1C1mu_Oc5aXGVt-lfDpmeqN1qJf0r6LrnnGV9-nBcrZSSQ) , they are unofficial hostels run by Afghans\. People usually sleep on the floor in one large room\. The word originates from Dari\.

[27 NGOs](https://ecre.org/greece-civil-society-organisations-demand-eu-action-on-third-country-concept-pushbacks-continue-with-frontex-involvement-ukrainians-receive-access-to-housing-medical-care-and-work-while-regular-re/) are currently calling for an end to Turkey’s designation as a safe third country\.

[7000 Ukrainians](https://ecre.org/greece-civil-society-organisations-demand-eu-action-on-third-country-concept-pushbacks-continue-with-frontex-involvement-ukrainians-receive-access-to-housing-medical-care-and-work-while-regular-re/) have been welcomed to Greece so far\.

26 people from Palestine, Libya, Ghana and Yemen were left adrift at sea by the Greek Coast Guard on Tuesday having previously arrived to Chios\. They were eventually rescued by the Turkish Coast Guard\.

CYPRUS
#### Children protesting living conditions

[The country’s children’s rights commissioner says conditions in Pournara camp are unhygienic and miserable\.](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/39132/cyprus-miserable-conditions-for-children-in-migrant-camp) Up to 15 people share a room and children often have to share beds or sleep on the floor\. Yet, when the children were offered alternative accommodation by the church, they were prevented from entering\.

MALTA
#### Free the El Hiblu 3 Book

[The new book has contributions from](https://medium.com/p/6bab0f12c672/edit) the three accused, their lawyers, members of the campaign and the Freedom Commission\. It denounces the injustice Abdalla, Amara and Kader have experienced since their criminalisation in Malta in 2019\.

Aminata Traoré addressed global inequality and the criminalisation of migration in her contribution as follows:


> Unless we look at the problem from the perspective of the global expansion of this odious system of plundering natural resources and exploiting human beings, there will be no way out\. 





The book is available free [HERE\.](https://elhiblu3.info/FreeEH3_book.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3W5drvsws1JYSe5LzvKYcnaMOcJj4WlKrvtIYrYLjEJHWoXfSpACPxYVg)

SPAIN
#### Melilla entries

[4700 people have tried to enter Melilla](https://twitter.com/ecre/status/1502296905564536835?s=20&t=uHe-740geIhl2EjreezAyg&fbclid=IwAR0BoEwxKq4HQXxTrCa7jKj49QhcV3FhmciSG9VS65uDmsftmWpbqS_oibU) in the last days by crossing the fence that divides the Spanish territory from Morocco\. [The deadly sea route to the Canaries has meanwhile been very quiet](https://ecre.org/spain-record-number-of-melilla-crossings-as-violence-prompts-outrage-quiet-spell-on-the-atlantic-route-preparations-to-welcome-ukrainians/) \. For some people being cut by razor wire and severely beaten by white police officers is clearly a better option than taking a boat journey [which killed 4400 people last year alone](https://www.euronews.com/2022/01/03/migrants-number-of-people-lost-at-sea-trying-to-reach-spain-doubles-in-a-year) \. That these are the only two options for the majority of people speaks very clearly to the global mobility apartheid we currently live under\.

GERMANY
#### European Court of Justice Rules against Germany

[The ECJ has ruled that minimum standards must be observed when detaining people for the purpose of deportation](https://www.proasyl.de/pressemitteilung/wichtiges-eugh-urteil-fluechtlinge-die-abgeschoben-werden-sollen-duerfen-nicht-gemeinsam-mit-straftaetern-inhaftiert-werden/?fbclid=IwAR0s_BH5RDnFoRfsmzmGIz8sciyyInaFBKcv1T0tYEkGA4etjjS0j0Oa7hQ) , and that they must not be accommodated in prison\-like facilities\. Currently people are detained in places like the Bavarian Hof or the Glückstadt in Schleswig\-Holstein, which are surrounded by meter\-high, barbed wire\-reinforced walls and thus clearly have the character of a prison\.

In an interview with Pro Asyl Lawyer Fahlbusch also highlighted that on average each of his clients was unjustly detained for almost four weeks\.


> This is a real scandal that should make us all think\. 





DENMARK
#### Racism persists at Danish border

[According to the federal police](https://www.fla.de/flensborg/gr%C3%A6nsen/41171/danmark-fortsaetter-med-at-afvise-flygtninge-fra-ukraine-ved-gr?fbclid=IwAR37S4BblUCEusyAeMnI1FoU_MSroaUXXmbVGKghxLeewQXvPK0XhGubB1I) , around 50 people from Ukraine were prevented from entering on Thursday afternoon\. Among them was a 24\-year\-old woman from Morocco who has lived and worked in Ukraine for three years\. She wanted to transit Denmark to get to Sweden where she has relatives\. Two further women with children were also prevented from entering\. They had Norwegian visas but the mothers could only present the children’s birth certificates, not passports\. For now they will be housed in Flensburg, Germany\.

[Criticisms continue](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/10/europe/denmark-refugees-ukraine-syrian-intl/index.html?fbclid=IwAR34xohH4GZtJRPM2gCrkqMFrduxIYEGt8Xx6SufiSQq5crA4wjVtaaWkm4) over Denmark's double standards when dealing with people fleeing war\.

FRANCE
#### France jumps on the racist bandwagon

[French far\-right presidential contender Eric Zemmour](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20220309-french-far-right-candidate-zemmour-says-ukrainians-welcome-but-not-arab-refugees?fbclid=IwAR0eWdYqSgrZcrOryKOmnGVprPS7HdcQ91jke_z2fMNVt07ntUrQrbaJBVM) , who has previous convictions for inciting hate crime, has said that Ukrainians with family links to France should be given visas, unlike those fleeing conflicts in “Arab Muslim” nations\. He previously stated he supported Putin and thinks the UK is doing a brilliant job\. Trustworthy guy\.

IRELAND
#### 14,500 homes pledged to Ukrainians

The Irish Red Cross have opened an online portal that allows people to register their offers of accomodation, and have received 14,500 offers\. During the height of the [ongoing civil war in Syria](https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/insights/28041/the-syria-civil-war-might-be-ending-but-the-crisis-will-live-on) only 1000 homes were offered\. Alternatives to camps and indefinite detention are, it seems, possible in Europe\.

UK
#### The continued deterioration of asylum, if you live long enough to claim it

[19 people died](https://thecivilfleet.wordpress.com/2022/03/11/19-people-died-in-home-office-asylum-seeker-accommodation-in-2021/?fbclid=IwAR3JWOhxJdiD3XmeBhRTpNMRu0Il9cNzmNLdiu6osTgisL3ffhXubkaxWbM) in asylum seeker accommodation in 2021\.

[The Joint Council for the Welfare of Migrants](https://www.jcwi.org.uk/migrants-in-the-covid-inquiry-joint-letter) have written a joint letter to the COVID\-19 Enquiry\.


> Faced with COVID, the Government should have done everything in its power to ensure everyone had support\. Everyone needs a way to earn a living, access to the public safety net if they need it, safe accommodation, and access to vaccines and the NHS\. 





> But Hostile Environment policies cut undocumented migrants off from these basic rights\. Because they don’t have the right piece of paper in their passport, people without status have been left destitute, homeless, and afraid or unable to get help during the pandemic\. 





Meanwhile, the general backlog has got so bad that Ukrainians are being told they will [not even be able to log their claims until July\.](https://twitter.com/ColinYeo1/status/1502216758035423234?s=20&t=3OlOX1IfU3-5Wsqp4KM39A&fbclid=IwAR13Y9aGDh2-Csj4xWrg5jdX8jCRsc9xtIjvE0LeyHc4saFSmg6uFdI97qA)
