### Evictions of EKO, Hara and BP continue

Following evictions of refugees from Hotel Hara and BP station, evacuation started this morning at ECO gas station without any warning from the police\. The volunteers said the police came around 4 am and told everyone to evacuate immediately\. Final count: 32 buses, around 1,132 refugees evacuated\. People on the ground reported that the Greek police arrested a number of volunteers\. Refugees are taken to Vasilika military camp where no media is allowed in\.

The new camp consists of tents inside an old abandoned facility\. According to first reports from site, it has running water and toilets, but it seems there will be not enough for all who come in during today and tomorrow\.

This morning, AYS volunteers have visited at least 5 Syrian families and more than 20 very small kids still living under very bad conditions inside a gas station squat near Idomeni\. They would like to go to Athens but they will have to go to one of the camps around Thessaloniki\. Among children, we met a 5 days old baby Ahmed, who was born on site\. AYS will keep supporting refugees throughout the evictions of makeshift camps around Polykastro\.

[Ekathimerini](http://www.ekathimerini.com/209542/article/ekathimerini/news/police-start-evacuating-migrant-camps-in-northern-greece) reports that recent evictions were part of a larger evacuation of makeshift camps around the area of Polykastro\. Around 300 officers were taking part in the operation to relocate a total of around 4,000 refugees from the makeshift camps into state\-run facilities\.

According to Ekathimerini, the operation is about to continue on Tuesday, on another camp close to a different gas station near the exit from the national highway for Evzonoi\. Some 1,936 refugees are living there\.
#### GREECE/GENERAL
### **UNHCR launches update of the regional Refugee and Migrant Response Plan**

[Today UNHCR is commencing an update of the regional Refugee and Migrant Response Plan](http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/briefing/2016/6/575a83e68/unhcr-partners-revise-funding-needs-greece-balkans.html) that monitors the eastern Mediterranean and Western Balkans\. Due to the EU\-Turkey agreement and border closures, an update was required\.

“These developments have had a significant impact on the numbers of refugees and migrants arriving, with a decrease in the number of people along the Western Balkans route and an increase in the number of people remaining in Greece\. While the measures adopted have significantly reduced the number of arrivals in Greece, over 57,000 refugees and migrants are currently dispersed across the country in several sites on the mainland and the islands\.”, said UNHCR spokesperson William Spindler\. In this sense, UNHCR and partners have shifted their focus from people on the move to the population already inside Greece, along with protection activities in the western Balkans\.
### **57,194 refugees currently stranded in Greece**

According to the Government sources, at 8AM today there were 57,194 refugees stranded in Greece\. There were 8,464 people stranded on the islands — 3,499 on Lesvos, 1,284 on Samos, 2,514 on Chios, 583 on Leros, 539 on Kos, 39 on Rodos, and 6 on Kalymnos\. The Government reports 14,851 in Attica region\. Further, there are 2,126 people in Central Greece and 283 in Southern Greece \(in Kyllini Andravidas\) \. Finally, the Government reports 26,110 in Northern Greece\. There were 67 new arrivals to the islands in the 24 period ending at 07:30AM this morning, with 37 on Lesvos, 11 on Samos and 19 on Chios\.
### **So far 1,200 refugees pre\-registered in Thessaloniki and Athens areas**

In an attempt to speed up asylum applications, Greece aims to “pre\-register” 1,400 people a day in its new asylum access system, which means they will be granted the legal right to stay in Greece for one year and to have access to basic services\. The operation began last Wednesday and seeks to deal with the some 48,000 people\. So far, 1,200 people have been “pre\-registered” on several sites in Thessaloniki and Athens areas\. Preregistration in Cherso camp will start on Wednesday and should last for 3 days\.

Refugees will receive an asylum applicant’s card, which means they should get an interview in the next few months with the asylum service\. Pre\-registration is seen as a first step to either relocation, family reunification or application for international protection in Greece\. The program will last for two months and aims to encompass all applicants that came to Greece from January 1 2015 until March 19, 2016, a day before the EU\-Turkey deal\.
