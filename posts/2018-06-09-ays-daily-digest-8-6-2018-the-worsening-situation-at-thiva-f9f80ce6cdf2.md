### Feature: The abandoned camp of Thiva

AYS has been informed that the situation in the Thiva camp, [which used to be one of the better spots](http://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/6672/what-life-is-like-for-refugees-on-the-greek-mainland) , has worsened dramatically\. Even though we cannot confirm the report yet, we decided to publish the given information, as it is detailed and precise\. “The camp seemed to be a good resting place since it had what other camps did not offer in all ways: a semi\-formation of privacy,” our source told us about the camp, which is located some seven kilometers away from the city\. Every small apartment has some rooms, a kitchen and what is needed for everyday life\. In the bigger containers outside, even two families can be sheltered and they have their own toilets\.

Some 800 people are said to live there, and recent reports stated that even more people would be transferred there after Elliniko was shut down\.

But “the total absence of any independent volunteers in the area or nearby and the presence of two or three NGOs gradually gave rise to a number of problems, which caused people to feel more and more harassed\.” NFI’s are only distributed every week or 15 days, and for diapers the families even need to show a paper from a doctor saying the baby needs them— if they do not have this, they need to pay for the diapers themselves with the cash assistance provided by the UNHCR\.

As the city as well as the supermarkets are kilometers away, it is not easy for the people to reach them\. A bus ticket costs them six Euros, and there is a free bus only once a week going from a factory nearby to a market in the city, which sells only fruits and vegetables\. Some locals have opened a small shop close to the camp — with prices 30–40% more expensive than in the regular supermarkets\.

Another problem is the laundry: People have access to a machine only one day a week “and if you lose your turn you have to wait for another 7–10 days”\. Furthermore, children have barely any access to activities\. There are a football field and a do\-it\-yourself volleyball field nearby — but nothing more\. “Some exercising machines were also installed, but were then removed to make space for the kindergarden containers which never opened this school year\.” But at least some children were able to attend regular classes\. For adults there does not seem to be much more to do\. A gym room is opened in the mornings occasionally as well as a room with sewing machines once per week\. Additionally, an NGO provides Greek and English lessons\. Women have a safe space run by another team, which also opens occasionally on working days\. “When the night falls, frightened families get inside their rooms and single men play football, fight, drink or make noise in every way possible until late”, our source reports\.

The situation became even more desperate when a team of doctors left the camp some two weeks ago, after their EU funding expired and local authorities refused to provide Amka for the hospital for questionable reasons\. “Tensions grew higher and higher, since many adults and children face serious medical problems, and others still cannot reach the asylum service through Skype\.” Additionally, sometimes racist behavior of the hospital staff is reported\. When the UNHCR announced a temporary stop to the accomodation programme in Athens and other big cities, the camp residents started a protest, sent out all the NGOs and closed the camp gate\.

This led to a promising meeting with representatives of the migration ministry — with disappointing results: a reduced ticket price for the bus, transportation to and from the hospital twice a week and 24/7 security, which had not happened before\. However, the camp residents are still waiting for an answer about the accommodation program\. But the ministry and the UNHCR are shuffling their responsibilities off onto each other\.


All these problems are leading to tensions and sometimes also to fights among the residents\. Our source concludes: “All these matters raised fear in women and children and made the camp nationalities start fighting each other\. Syrians, Kurdish people from Iraq/Syria, Afghans, Pakistanis and one boy from Tsad seemed to try to co\-exist peacefully untill now…”
### Syria

According to information obtained by DER SPIEGEL, Germany’s chief federal prosecutor, Peter Frank, has filed charges against Jamil Hassan, head of Syria’s feared Air Force Intelligence, for “crimes against humanity\.”

The move represents the most serious effort yet by a Western country to hold a high\-ranking member of President Bashar Assad’s regime accountable for having systematically targeted its own population since the beginning of the Syrian uprising in 2011\.

Also, the [Syria campaign](https://www.facebook.com/TheSyriaCampaign/photos/a.608812989210718.1073741828.607756062649744/1787145064710832/?type=3&theater) and other sources report about a massacre in Idlib\. At least 42 people are said to have died after airstrikes at Zardana\.
### Turkey

There are as yet [unconfirmed reports](https://www.facebook.com/TurkeySyr/posts/679047292433215) that the Turkish police have carried out security operations in the 81st governorate\. Allegedly 181 people were arrested during this action\. According to an AYS source, there are indeed increased security operations before the elections\. Furthermore, there are rumors of suspended medical transfers and other measures at the border, which may be closed for a longer period\.
### Cyprus

The Cyprus Refugee Council has [announced](https://www.facebook.com/cyrefugeecouncil/posts/256287478269449) that the Strovolos Municipality will host a training event on access to the labour market on 24th June from 10am to 1pm at the Acropolis park\. The training includes the preparation of a CV, communication techniques during the job interview and sources to find work\. Interested people are asked to contact and register with Ms\. Athena Christodoulidou, either via email: achristodoulidou@strovolos\.org\.cy or by phone: 22470325\. If a sufficient number of participants is reached, a bus will be arranged from Solomou Square to Acropolis Park\.
### Greece

The Kurdish people who are currently living at Pikpa on Lesvos have released a statement: they demand that the Greek and European authorities protect them and their rights\. They have been staying at Pikpa since the violent clashes in Moria on 25th May\. You can find the full statement here: [https://opentheislands\.wordpress\.com/2018/06/08/persecuted\-kurdish\-people\-in\-lesvos\-release\-statement\-to\-authorities/](https://opentheislands.wordpress.com/2018/06/08/persecuted-kurdish-people-in-lesvos-release-statement-to-authorities/) \. Pikpa has been hosting around 250 extra people since the clashes\.

With the increasing number of people who are again arriving in Greece by sea and especially by land, the camps in Northern Greece remain fully stretched\. In Diavata camp, once again camping tents were set up\. “It’s as if we have a smaller Idomeni camp\. Unregistered people waiting and waiting without support or a cash card, trying to call Skype to register: no answer\! Poor food supplied by officials\. No electricity and no lights”, [Refugee Biriyani & Bananas](https://www.facebook.com/RefugeeBiriyaniAndBananas/?hc_ref=ARTqcUfikpyUjfoZA5uhjEIsXD59qX7j4Bob37LQeGXk9Ps5QZrSGBrfX9V55FUz0lM&fref=nf) explains the situation in Diavata\.

The strike of translators at the Greek Asylum Service is over, the [Mobile Info Team for refugees in Greece](https://www.facebook.com/mobileinfoteam/photos/a.1800063030222418.1073741830.1796286800600041/2184370071791710/?type=3) notes\. “ That means that everything is going back to normal again\. The translators were on strike since Thursday the 31st of May, because they didn’t get paid by the Greek state for 10 months\.”

Six people, including three children, died during a car accident on a highway in northern Greece close to Kavala today, AP [reports](https://www.apnews.com/5b3710ec55804f2bb8bc35fdfe067080) \. More were injured, after the car veered off the road and crashed into rocks\. There were 16 people crammed into the vehicle, the police said\.

The Open Space sociocultural community centre in Drama is looking for volunteers who can commit for at least four weeks or longer\. “We create an open space where the ideas, problems and suggestions of each individual are heard,” the team writes\. Additionally, they try to connect camp residents and locals\. For more info contact creatingopenspace@posteo\.de or check their [website](https://creatingopenspace.wordpress.com/) \.

### Bosnia

The police in Sarajevo is preventing people on the move from staying in parks even if they are just sitting on the ground\. AYS tried to contact somebody from the police but did not get further than the switchboard\. One policeman we spoke to told us he is not obliged to explain why this is happening and that people who were ordered to leave the green area, a public space near the train station, made a mess which is punushable by law\. He refused to say which law\.

At the same time, there are rumors that soon the police will start preventing street food distribution\. At the moment more than 500 people are sleeping rough in Sarajevo and the only help they have is provided by locals and international volunteers\.

So far, the police in Bosnia has been professional and humane, but it seems this could change soon\. On Thursday, a big meeting with politicians from the region plus Austria was held where they discussed how to prevent migration on the Balkan route\.

Meanwhile, the European Comission has [announced](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-4062_en.htm) a 1\.5 million Euro fund to adress the increased number of people entering Bosnia\.
### Germany

People from various Bavarian cities gathered in Regensburg today to protest against deportations and racism\.

### Sea

The sea in the central Mediterranean is becoming more rough with waves estimated to be as high as 2\.5 meters\. Today, the Sea\-Eye had to face another tough day while rescueing 119 people in distress\. “Already one hour after our takeover the weather worsened so much, that the rescue would have been impossible for us,” Klaus Stadler, captain of Sea\-Eyes and Seefuchs said\. Several attempts to hand over the rescued people failed due to the bad weather, leaving the Seefuchs itself in distress\. It is not suitable to carry such a large number of people for a prolonged period of time — especially not in these weather conditions\.

In the end, the Sea\-Eye was able to transfer the people to a safe harbor in Pozzallo\. Thanks to the help of the tanker “Mineral Energy”, which accompanied the ship and thus prevented it from being hit by the waves, this action could be concluded safely\.

But also for the Sea\-Watch crew the day was not easy, and not only because it unsuccessfully tried to assist the Seefuchs crew\. Referring to another incident, which happened before, the NGO notes: “ After first providing assistance, Sea\-Watch sailed for 90 nautical miles to assist a merchant vessel which had also been involved in a rescue\. Only the NGO became available for transshipment, supporting MRCC Rome in allowing the cargo ship to proceed with its activities, without leaving its work area\. Subsequently Sea\-Watch, despite having an assigned landing port, was engaged in other search operations, towards a position at about 70 nautical miles north of the Libyan coast, where then an Italian Navy vessel intervened\.”

In the western Mediterranean, the marine forces and [Salvamento Maritimo](https://twitter.com/salvamentogob) also rescued dozens of people from several boats in distress\.

In its Missing Migrants Project, the IOM recorded 1401 deaths so far in 2018\. With 785 deaths in the Mediterranean, this route remains the most dangerous one\. But also on European soil, 29 people lost their lives while trying to reach a better life in safety\.

### Italy

While episodes of intolerance are becoming more frequent in Italy, many organizations are working for the integration of refugees, their participation in civil society and overcoming their traumas of war\. In this context, the organization Ospiti in Arrivo from Udine is creating a cricket team, but they need a little financial support\. If you can donate, go to: [https://www\.produzionidalbasso\.com/project/playing\-for\-change\-cambiamo\-il\-mondo\-con\-lo\-sport\-2/](https://www.produzionidalbasso.com/project/playing-for-change-cambiamo-il-mondo-con-lo-sport-2/)
### France

The Refugee Women’s Centre in Dunkirk today provided information to women about available support in Calais\. They did this alongside other NGO’s, including a representative of the UNHCR, as part of the women’s day event\. “Alongside the information session, we made pancakes and pampered women with homemade face masks and nail painting\.”


[![Dunkirk / Dunkerque Refugee Women's Centre]( "Dunkirk / Dunkerque Refugee Women's Centre")](https://www.facebook.com/refugeewomenscentre/posts/433706643721638)


L’Auberge des Migrants, as well as other teams operating in and around Calais and Dunkirk, is asking for tents\. The police are routinely taking them from people and also confiscating blankets and personal belongings\. You can find more information in this link: [http://www\.laubergedesmigrants\.fr/fr/dons\-materiels](http://www.laubergedesmigrants.fr/fr/dons-materiels/) /\.

Additionally, the organisation has called for a march in Paris on 17th June at 4pm at Place de la Bastille, from where the protesters will walk to the Place de la Republique in protest against the the current government policy\. In Calais, a similar action will take place from the gravelines at 7th July on 9pm\.

### UK

According to Safe Passage, the UK government has conceded the Dubs amendment in the EU withdrawal bill\. This means it wants to keep the right of children to be reunited with their families even after the UK leaves the EU\. But this Government concession doesn’t go far enough, as it does not include the wider family \(aunts & uncles\), which means about half of the child refugees we help through this EU regulation will be at risk,” Safe Passage writes, calling on UK citizens to write to their MP\.
