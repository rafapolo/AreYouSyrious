### AYS News Digest 28/2/22: Structural forms of violence in the management of migration and asylum in Greece
#### Information on Ukraine for those fleeing and people helping them // Updates from the Mediterranean // Police pressure continues in France // UK: asylum seekers in hotels waiting for months for £8 // Open your eyes to the deportations and other repressive actions taking place silently while all eyes are pointed at Ukraine // Afghanistan: a new travel ban // recommended articles and news summaries…

#### FEATURE

Today we want to highlight the ongoing injustice and violence \(still\) taking place across the routes people take to reach safety for the chance of protection\. This time we focus on Greece, through a report that was composed and published by the colleagues from the Border Violence Monitoring Network \(BVMN\) \.

It considers violence within state borders experienced by people\-on the\-move and those seeking asylum in Greece\.

40 testimonies that were collected in recent months clearly and undoubtedly speak of violence in detention, police brutality, racist violence, and hate crimes, as well as open source data on structural forms of violence present in the management of migration and asylum in Greece\.


![](assets/e042764da7a6/0*-5tgUdxpBnzKpfqe.jpg)


The situation continues to deteriorate, leaving people at increasing risk of both physical harm, and structural violence against their living conditions and immediate amenities\.


> This report is part of a relatively new branch of our network that documents violence within a state’s borders on a recurring basis\. Here, we look more broadly at violence against people\-on\-the\-move in Greece and contextualise it in the political context\. In the report you will find: 





> \- a case\-study of Paranesti Pre\-Removal Detention Centre 





> \- violence in the Port of Patras 





> \- evictions 





> Read the full report below for extended analysis and testimonies by people\-on\-the\-move, as informed by our long\-term monitoring through qualitative and quantitative observations of the situation on the ground by BVMN’s partner organisations\. 





> This report was produced within the Border Violence Monitoring Network’s \(BVMN\) Internal Violence Working group\. _BVMN is a network of watchdog organisations active in Greece and the Western Balkans including No Name Kitchen, Rigardu, Are You Syrious, MobileInfoTeam, Push\-back Alarm Austria, Josoor, InfoKolpa, Centre for Peace Studies, BlindSpots, Mare Liberum, Collective Aid, and Fresh Response\._ As such, this document was produced through joint collaboration of these groups\.

#### UKRAINE
### Be mindful of people’s \(trust and\) vulnerability

Note to helpers: many private initiatives and different organisations have formed in order to help people fleeing Ukraine\. However, drawing from experience and advice from organisations focused on women and children, we would like to invite everyone to [be particularly careful](https://missingchildreneurope.eu/war-on-ukraine-protect-children-before-they-go-missing/) both when giving their support, but especially when passing information, contacts or documents of people to other parties, be it organisations or people willing to host/transport/help\. The safety of everyone should be at the heart of everything being done, so please be mindful of this\.

### Racist borders prevail even in war

While the war rages in Ukraine, thousands are trying to flee the country and go to neighbouring EU states from where they would either continue their journey towards places where they have family and relatives, or to cities in countries with strong Ukrainian diaspora, like Poland\. The [plight of the people](https://t.co/1sxEv5aIym) is dramatic and sadly follows the same patterns some of us have already seen elsewhere\. Even in these circumstances, racism, segregation, lack of understanding and acceptance and consistent discrimination remains\.

Many cases of racial and other discrimination in the course of evacuation of people and at the border crossings have been documented, as stated in the thread by Lighthouse Reports:

Black students say they have been stopped from boarding trains, and abused by police\. Reactions from different sides arrive, among others a statement from the African Union on cases of mistreatment of Africans currently attempting to leave Ukraine:

Because of all this, the No Border community advises certain border crossings for those who are not Ukrainians and are leaving the country:

#### Croatia

National and many local authorities have expressed readiness to receive people from Ukraine in the coming period, with three main points as reception centres: Zagreb, Varaždin \(north\) and Osijek \(east\) \.

The City of Zagreb has stated they will provide accommodation in temporary centres which will be located at Motel Plitvice, Tomislavov dom \(Sljeme\) and Grad mladih, all governed by the City\.

Organisation ADRA will be collecting aid and funds for people in Ukraine and the border area, while Solidarna Foundation will be supporting Ukrainians in Croatia\. Solidarna will also need volunteers for organising different activities related to these planned actions, but more information will be available through their social media channels\.

We hope that the Croatian system for reception and international protection will get equally quick and effective towards those coming from other war\-torn parts of the world, already in Croatia and waiting for the answer to their request for asylum\. We also hope that the authorities and international organisations deliver what they promise, not just an indefinite period of grey blankets, temporary beds and tuna cans…

So far, there is no need for aid in kind or donations and practical action in terms of parallel systems to the ones that will be secured by the local and national authorities and well funded orgs\. 
We will keep you updated on the development of the situation\.

If you wish to volunteer, remotely or in Zagreb, AYS is open for new volunteers for different teams, so reach out to us and let’s do this\!
#### POLAND

Grupa Granica has demanded some clear steps from their government in the face of the current crisis:


> In view of the ongoing Russian aggression against Ukraine and the arrival in Poland of more people fleeing the hostilities, we call on the Government of Poland and all parliamentarians to undertake urgent legislative work to introduce, in an extremely expedited manner, the necessary changes to the legislation which will include: 





> Ensuring legal entry and stay of every citizen and national from Ukraine on the territory of Poland solely on the basis of holding Ukrainian citizenship for the necessary period, at least 6 months 





All the while, many people remain stuck around the Polish borders from the Belarusian side\. Difficulties, hardship and the lack of options show themselves in some very dramatic situations such the one where a woman and a man were stuck in a swamp in a border area, and thankfully in this case they were saved\. Many face such degrading and impossible situations on a daily basis\.
