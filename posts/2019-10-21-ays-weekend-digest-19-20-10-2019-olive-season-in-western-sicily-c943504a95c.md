> “What shall I say, we come every year and the working situation is worse and worse, and this year there are no olives, which makes everything more complicated\. \[…\] You keep doing, how do you call them, “technical tables”, but we are even more slaves, we are laughed at if we talk about contracts, we are blacks good only for picking olives, and then we disappear, closed inside this cement factory, hidden to the eyes…” _\(Moussa, migrant worker in Campobello, Trapani\)_ 





Borderline Sicilia [report](https://www.borderlinesicilia.org/campobello-2019-una-nuova-raccolta-di-olive-allinsegna-dello-sfruttamento/?fbclid=IwAR0CgvloMDJ4ohuU8yATtQvYp5Yh9s0R8tDmzM7QXKSfBTgb1MZgn14jAFw) that the olive season has just started in the area of Campobello, Trapany county, western Sicily, but workers are already experiencing problems\.

The exploitation of migrant workers during the olive harvest is not new, it has been going on for 25 years\. For a time, until three years ago, local associations — led by Libera, the national anti\-mafia association — had stepped up, and organised a camp to host workers\. Living conditions were still below standard, but the dynamics were more solidarity\-based\. In the last few years, however, local institutions have excluded the associations, and in 2019 they presented a plan developed by a technical task\-force which negotiated with land\-owners and unions\. Associations have so far failed to propose and foster an alternative to the widespread exploitation of workers, but institutions are not doing any better\.

Associations\-run camp, western Sicily, 2017 \(foto by [Alberto Biondo, Borderline Sicilia](https://www.borderlinesicilia.org/i-nuovi-schiavi/) \)

A camp was built, only for documented people, with a capacity of 240 beds\. Managed by the Red Cross, it has toilets and showers, but no food is provided\. In 2018 a catering service was offered in exchange for an entry fee to the camp, but most people left due to the excessive costs which took too much from their very low wages\. The task\-force also regulated the hosting of workers in the farms they work for, but implemented no control, meaning that conditions have already been reported as far below any human standard \(unhygienic, without toilets or showers, overcrowded…\) — with many people opting to live in makeshift camps, or abandoned buildings\. Even more, one company \(Varvaro\) which contracts workers for the farms in the area, has opened a receptive structure that workers have to pay for, so it can make money from them twice\.

The actions of the task\-force were aimed to empty makeshift camps, and ghettoes, but the ex\-cement factory in Campobello, which has been used as a shelter for years, still hosts 600 people, documented and undocumented\. As Borderline Sicilia report, it is riddled with safety and hygiene issues\. A group of women forced into prostitution live and work there, water and access to huts is expensive and controlled by criminal groups, the sewage is open and runs next to the building, the building is full of asbestos, etc\.

Contracts are also a problem, despite the statements of the institutions most contracts are fake and nothing more than a scam against workers and a smoke\-screen to protect employers\. As Moussa notes: “with these fake contracts I won’t be able to ask for unemployment benefits, which is my right\.”

In a territory where the influence of Cosa Nostra is very strong, this regularisation of slave\-like conditions, hailed as a victory by the institutions, has worsened the situation for many workers in the area, but also attracted people working in other areas of the country\. In a year where the harvest seems to be low, this will lead to even worse conditions for workers\.

According to [Aegean Boat Report](https://www.facebook.com/AegeanBoatReport/posts/674326593090448?hc_location=ufi) at least 17 boats have arrived on the Greek Aegean Islands over the weekend, carrying 520 people\. For a detailed breakdown visit their [page](https://www.facebook.com/AegeanBoatReport/photos/a.285312485325196/675730679616706/?type=3&theater) \.
#### Transfers to mainland Greece

It is [reported](https://twitter.com/BrunoTersago/status/1185929901712596992?fbclid=IwAR2PE_EVUOI2SleLDhNagpC0KoaB2EwvaWJSavWH6PqQV2NacEu8Sc7T1tE) that a total of 700 asylum seekers are expected to be transferred on Monday from Samos to the port of Piraeus and from there to hosting facilities in the mainland\. Both locals and residents of the camps have been [protesting](https://greece.greekreporter.com/2019/10/20/situation-on-samos-deteriorates-as-migrant-flows-continue-to-arrive/?fbclid=IwAR2XR7kbwi2yLyEm4_BHWh1dX6MyfAltk4hiVULulw8J03hV-YxXqZitQhc) against the conditions there and for relocation from the island\.
#### Updates from Moria, Europe’s largest refugee camp

There are now 14,000 people present in the camp and conditions are worsening in the build up to winter while arrivals still far outstrip transfers\.

[Reports from the ground](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10219788231038229&set=pcb.10219788443883550&type=3&__tn__=HH-R&eid=ARDpEu7HMA_w0CWisqhP5kJrfuz5DpyvWcFVG85MMOaZAw5qAs2gl9NJjt1IMfdMgWwmq8EAVZxy9Xei) state there are currently around 700 people in Korinthos, a mix of people who were evicted in Athens and transfers from the islands\.


> Among them are 97 small children under 4 years old as well as 120 minor children, with no hope of attending school, but no other opportunity for creative time other than the solidarity educators from Corinth who sometimes visit, without the materials that will help with their work and without the required support from IOM that despite all their calls for a tent to be given to teachers, the children have not been given space\. 





As you can see from the photos the camp has not been fully built yet, there is no hot water and the electricity cuts out every 5 minutes\. There are obvious concerns as to how people will manage to survive in winter if they can not heat their rooms or adequately wash themselves or their children\.


> As the camp is in considered to be transit and the refugees are supposed not to stay there for long, they are not provided with sheets or blankets, but only a blanket for every person, so people sleep on a common mattress, with a blanket not enough to warm up\. They also have no clothes or shoes\. 





Of course many people did have their own blankets and clothes but when they were evicted they were not allowed to bring any of their own possessions\.

There is also no medical presence, putting at risk people with health problems, especially those without an AMKA, children, pregnant people, and breastfeeding mothers\.


> We stand in solidarity with them and unite our voices with their own voices to address these serious problems that honour neither our country nor Europe, nor ourselves\. 




#### Update from Patras


![\(Photo Credit: [No Name Kitchen](https://www.facebook.com/nobordersnetwork/posts/2545386755529201?hc_location=ufi) \)](assets/c943504a95c/1*tiKLnmJtECuBgdcgNgDPKg.jpeg)

\(Photo Credit: [No Name Kitchen](https://www.facebook.com/nobordersnetwork/posts/2545386755529201?hc_location=ufi) \)

[No Name Kitchen](https://www.facebook.com/NoNameKitchenBelgrade/posts/819053281826291) report that the situation in Patras is still difficult\. There was no medical support for 10 days and in the squats there have been new cases of scabies\. A boy is currently in hospital awaiting an operation on his wrist after being hit by a car while trying to access the port\. Police are still making people’s lives harder with raids on squats, document checks and harassment during food service\.
#### Situation in Vučjak, Bosnia, at breaking point

[Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/10/19/bosnia-should-immediately-close-inhumane-migrant-camp?fbclid=IwAR3qLbII8N4rPSHy2Pa8-EY-RFt6HKKs4E4kdapsZemcoAvWCXayAAVnLc8) are again calling for the closure of Vučjak on the Bosnian/Croatian border after 1700 people were transferred there on the 16th of October\. There are now approximately 2400 people living in tents\. IOM pulled out due to the bad conditions in January 2019, the Red Cross remain, but may now also leave\. The local authorities are threatening to cut off electricity and sanitation\. The dire living conditions, combined with the continued violence faced by people attempting to cross the border, have created a human rights emergency\.
#### New arrivals in Tuzla

[Volunteers continue](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=116644359751536&id=108916427190996&hc_location=ufi) to provide food and blankets as more people arrive and street homelessness increases\.

Luckily the 45 people on the boat reached the coasts of Lampedusa by themselves\.

One of these actions was done in Maltese waters, after [coordination between Italian MRCC and LCG](https://twitter.com/AngiKappa/status/1185547125897211904) \. 4 boats arrived in Lampedusa autonomously\.

**Weekend** : Libyan media report that between Saturday and Sunday 237 people in four different sea operations were brought back to Libya\.

One more rubber boat was rescued by Italian commercial vessel Asso29\. 68 people will be [transferred](https://twitter.com/AngiKappa/status/1185939111242285056) to a military boat and brought to Pozzallo \(Sicily\) on Monday\.

#### MSF published medical guidelines and app

The guidelines are the collaborative work of several experienced medical practitioners and specialists, and were developed for non\-specialised medical staff\. The MSF Medical Guidelines mobile app allows users to browse, save and download content in high and low quality resolutions to view remotely in the field\.

Amongst all migrants, children form a particularly vulnerable group that need special attention\. [The Knowledge Centre on Migration and Demography \(KCMD\)](https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/publication/data-children-migration) , in its mission to support the European Commission’s overall response to the opportunities and challenges related to migration, has developed a comprehensive collection of data and related information on migration in general, and in particular on migrant children\. The first report on this subject, called “The Basics”, provides an overview about the current content of the KCMD repository on data and knowledge\.
