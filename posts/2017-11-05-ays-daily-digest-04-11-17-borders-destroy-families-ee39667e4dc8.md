Over 40 solidarity groups and organisations active on the Greek islands and mainland have called for urgent action from authorities to prevent more refugees from dying in the cold as winter sets in once again\. Six people who were seeking refuge and protection in Europe died in Moria last winter\. [Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/10/23/greece-asylum-seekers-abysmal-conditions-islands) says that Greek islands have become places of indefinite confinement and that thousands of refugees are trapped in deplorable and volatile conditions\.

Today, Lesvos Lgbtiq\+ Refugee Solidarity also called for the transfer of LGBTQI\+ refugees to the mainland, arguing they are especially at risk in Moria as they face threats of homophobic and transphobic violence\.

The hunger strike at Syndagma Square, Athens, by seven women and seven men calling for a rapid reunification with their families in Germany, has entered its 4th day\. The group says many families have already been waiting for more than 18 months under deplorable conditions and calls on the Greek and German government to respect the legal limit of six months to reunify families from the date of acceptance\.

Jugend Rettet says it expects a decision over its appeal against the confiscation of its ship Iuventa to be announced at the earliest in December\. It says that “more than 3 months have passed since the seizure and there are still neither individual cases nor specific accusations against the organization or individuals”\. This seizure prevents Jugend Rettet from participating in search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean\. Meanwhile, the IOM says over 2,560 refugees were rescued over the past four days, while 34 bodies were recovered\.
