### Feature

Today we want to start with some good news: In a joint effort the [We Are Here — Community Centre](https://www.facebook.com/WeAreHereCentre/posts/1959116530976609) and The Timber Project with support of Help Refugees rebuilt the community center of the Nea Kavala camp in Northern Greece and finally reopened it\. After it burnt down, volunteers worked tireless to set it up again and were done already in February\. During the last weeks We Are Here with support of LDS Charities managed to finance interior walls, furniture and other needed items\.

Further volunteers revamped the women’s centre with help of the camp residents to make it a more comfortable place\. This all happened while the number of residents in the camp is decreasing the last days\. “ Many are just relieved and happy to be finally leaving the camp\. Yet it is another move to an unknown location, without knowing what will be waiting for them, who they will have around them or what services or information they can expect,” We Are Here reports\. But there is a lack of information as the residents don’t know where they will be moved and only get a notice one day before they leave\. But at least they are being transferred to appartments in different towns\. Of course, this does not neccessarily mean, the camp will be closed soon\. We Are Here says: “We believe it is likely that people will be brought to Nea Kavala from the arrival islands, which are very overcrowded\. If this happens, we don’t know if the camp will first be completely emptied or not, so we must remain flexible as always about what the next step could be\.”
### Iraq

### Greece
#### Samos

Advocates Abroad reported another case of police brutality on Samos\. Two residents of the hotspot in Vathy accuse five police officers of beating and kicking them after a passport control\. After being thrown off a small cliff they ran through cactuses and bushes to get in safety\. They also say they heard two shots and are now afraid of leaving the camp again\. So far AYS was not able to get this incident confirmed by another source\.

Meanwhile nine women and for children who just arrived in Mytilini \(Lesvos\) would be detained in a bus close to the port over night\.

On Samos 20 new arrivals were registered today\. Volunteers reported two boats arriving this morning, 12 \(8 men, 2 women, 2 kids\) and 15 \(7 men, 1 teen, 3 women, 4 kids\), all ok\.
#### Piraeus

Referring to an article of [era\-aegean](http://www.era-aegean.gr/?p=24210) NoBorders Greece reports, that a couple in Piraeus was not allowed to enter a ship, because the women fainted\. They had an appointment for their asylum process in Athens\. Apparently there were also reports of police violence and no care by ambulance or other authorities\.

### Spain

Following the border crossing of Ceuta and Boza the Spanish Guardia Civil has [reportedly](https://beatingborders.wordpress.com/2017/03/05/bozas-and-new-tactics/) called for at least 150 more soldiers in the area and riot control equipment\. The Spanish Interior Minister further suggested to use drones to monitor the borders of Ceuta and Melilla\.
