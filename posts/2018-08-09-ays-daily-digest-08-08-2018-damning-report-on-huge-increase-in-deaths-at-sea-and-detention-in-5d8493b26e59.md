#### [Amnesty International calls on European leaders to take responsibility in light of surging death toll\.](https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2018/08/responsibility-for-surging-death-toll-in-central-med/)

While the number of people attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea in a bid to reach a port of safety in Europe has dropped, the number of deaths at sea has increased\.

Arbitrary detention in Libya has also skyrocketed\.


> “European governments are colluding with Libyan authorities to contain refugees and migrants in Libya, despite the horrific abuses they face at the hands of the Libyan Coast Guard and in detention centres in Libya\. Plans to expand this externalization policy across the region are deeply concerning,” said Matteo de Bellis, researcher on asylum and migration at Amnesty International\. 





As European policy is trending towards prevention of migration attempts across the Mediterranean, a report from the European Council on Refugees and Exile \(ECRE\) asks the question: [ASYLUM AT THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL 2018: OUTSOURCING OR REFORM?](https://www.ecre.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Policy-Papers-04.pdf) \.
#### The fortress model of Europe is at odds with human rights\.

A risk that merchant ships will bow to European pressure and therefore follow the instructions of the so\-called Libyan Coast Guard even if this is in breach of international law\. \(p\. 16\) 




### LIBYA

As deportation to Libya continues, the Global Peace Index ranks Libya as the 7th most dangerous country in the world\.

**_Libya: Uprising of migrants in camps as they fear being sold to traffickers_**

[Paolo Lambruschi writing for Avvenire:](https://www.avvenire.it/attualita/pagine/la-rivolta-dei-migranti-nel-lager-in-libia) Sudden disappearances, UN and diplomats struggle to gain access to the detention camps, severe overcrowding, and a registration deficit\.


> “Tarek Al Matar’s tensions exploded mainly due to the terror of being sold to traffickers, who manage the departures on the boats, but only after having tortured the prisoners to extort ransoms from their families, or sell them as slaves\.” writes Lambruschi\. 





20 people have disappeared in ´recent days´\.

Libyan police have responded to the uprising with terrible force and have wounded three asylum seekers, two of whom had to be hospitalized\.


> “We are desperate, many talk about suicide\. We do not see a way out\. We cannot go back to Eritrea, and Europe does not want us \.” Solomon, quoted in Lambruschi’s article\. 





Many of those detained are refugees and asylum seekers who should, according to law, be in safe countries to seek asylum or free to move\. A third are under the age of 18\.

### GERMANY

[Germany to deport refugees to Spain\.](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-and-spain-reach-agreement-on-migrant-return/a-44997574)

Germany made its first bilateral agreement to deport refugees to another European country\. If refugees are apprehended at the German border and Spain was the first port of entry on record with their data recorded in the European Dactyloscopy \(Eurodac\) fingerprint database, they will be deported to Spain within 48 hours\.

The interior ministry predicts that this could apply to approximately five people a day\. This will enter into effect on 11 August 2018\.

This is the first such agreement but the German government has stated that they intend to create more\.

[**_Businessman to pay fines for women after niqab\-ban_**](https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/qnBVG0/miljonaren-aker-till-danmark--betalar-allas-burkaboterMiljonären)

The first women were fined this weekend after the niqab\-ban went into effect in Denmark\. French\-Algerian businessman Rachid Nekkaz has said he will pay, not only this time — but for all women fined for wearing a burka or niqab in Denmark\. “I will pay everybody’s fines every month”, he told the Danish paper Berlingske\. The first fine is 1000 DK \(€130\), the second is 10000 DK \(€13,000\) \. Nekkaz has already paid approximately €245,000 in other European countries where there is similar legislation\. He says this it is not because he is pro\-niqab, it is a matter of freedom of choice and the civil rights of these women\.

The new law has provoked physical attacks, with a [woman reporting](https://www.facebook.com/kvinderidialog/videos/217154362310049/?hc_location=ufi) that her niqab was ripped off in public\.
