24 people of sub\-Saharan Origin, among them many women of which two were pregnant and two children, arrived around 1pm on the pier of Lampedusa on Monday 28\. 
People who arrived from Libya came to Lampedusa accompanied by the coast guard after being rescued at sea by the Sea Eye team, which is travelling to Sicily with other migrants on board\.
After their arrival they were accompanied inside the hotspot\. 
The centre is still open even though ASGI and others are pushing for its formal closure [on the accounts of violating the human rights](https://thebottomup.it/2018/05/07/chiusura-hotspot-lampedusa/) \. After having extensively written, collected evidence and communicated the unimaginably dire situation the people are in at the hotspot, it seems to be not only available for new arrivals, but it’s obviously overcrowded as well\.

The team that completed the SAR mission rescued 138 people\. Upon the action, the Italian Coast Guard took these 24 mainly vulnerable people from them but not all, even families were separated, it is r [eported](https://sea-eye.org/deutsches-ngo-schiff-mit-ueber-100-menschen-an-bord-nach-seenotrettung-in-gefahr/) \.

They also reportedly gave them inadequate amount of supplies \(food, water\) \. MRCC ordered the ship to disembark the people, even though it is not safe for so many people to be transferred and they don’t have the supplies to feed the people\. But MRCC refuses them to hand the people over to a bigger ship\.

### Northern Greece


> Two years after the Idomeni eviction, Northern Greece is in EMERGENCY MODE again\. Thousands of refugees,lots of kurdish people from the Afrin region in Syria, crossed the land border along the Evros River between Turkey and Greece\.
 

> There are still refugees arriving from the border in Thessaloniki\. The flow is increasing\. Lots of children\. Weather conditions are bad and population in the camps around is growing\. The limit is reached\.
 

> Currently there is one doctor, a nurse and a midwife to see 1300 unregistered people in the Diavata refugee camp and DocMobile sends a team of doctors and nurses during the week to support with medical help\. 
 

> Each day we are seeing 70 patients, and approximately 60% of these are children, many of who have fevers and various infections\. 
 

> Regarding pathologies of adults, it goes from a simple flu or back pain to people with chronic diseases such as heart problems, hypertension, diabetes\.
 

> All these unregistered people, who live in tents or sleep on blankets on the floor of an old school, mostly families, have no access to the Greek health system
 

> They only can go to hospital if there is an emergency\.
 

> Currently there is a big medication shortage and we have completely run out of antibiotics\. We urgently need donations so that we can replenish our medicine stocks\. — [_DocMobile — Medical Help e\.V\._](https://www.facebook.com/docmobile.org/)

### Border reception conditions

The Hellenic Council on Refugees has [published](https://www.gcr.gr/index.php/el/news/press-releases-announcements/item/892-nea-ekthesi-tou-esp-gia-tis-synthikes-ypodoxis-sta-synora) a detailed report on the conditions for the reception of asylum seekers at the Greek border\.


> Despite this standardization of practices, however, information provision at the borders still remains highly problematic throughout all process and procedures that asylum seekers undergo for the duration of their RIC based
 

> accommodation\. 





In general, the situation at the EU’s external and internal borders, as officials process migrants entering or passing through the EU, remains tense in some places, finds [the latest report](http://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2018/border-tensions-and-migrant-suffering-continue-feature-member-states) by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights on migration\-related fundamental rights issues\. It also highlights some of the hardships many migrants, particularly women and children, continue to experience\.


> Looking at the situation across 14 EU Member States, the report reveals how migrants are being sent back without the chance to lodge claims for international protection in France, Croatia, Spain, Hungary, Poland and Greece\.

### Austria doubles down on benefit cuts for foreigners

Following their earlier ruling, the ruling cabinet unveiled its modified plan benefits, which would cap single refugees’ main benefit payment at 563 euros \($656\) a month, rising to the 863 euros available to Austrians if the refugees pass a German test\. Kurz told a news [conference](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-austria-politics/austria-doubles-down-on-benefit-cuts-for-foreigners-idUKKCN1IT1BU) \.


> “That means that whoever has insufficient language skills will not be able to claim the full minimum benefit\.” 




Austria’s chancellor has previously [said](http://www.dw.com/en/austrias-sebastian-kurz-wants-to-use-eu-border-guards-in-africa/a-43947006) the EU border patrol guards should be sent to northern Africa\.
#### ITALY
### Humanitarian corridor continues

75 Syrians will arrive to Rome through humanitarian corridors on Tuesday, May 29\. A group comprised mostly of Syrians, will arrive from Lebanon thanks to the humanitarian corridors promoted by the Community of Sant’Egidio, adding to the 1500 people arrived in Italy , France and Belgium , in a legal and safe way, from February 2016\.
### Pressure continues in other places — Ventimmiglia

In the last two weeks, detention and deportation by the law enforcement have been increased, [Progetto20k](https://www.facebook.com/progetto20k/?hc_ref=ARTAdNTdjzlYM4e3ZQHSdvCtcxG3TzZbhSBY7DvCDhQq5hAHYHpnOvMalePc7lWmQ-o&fref=nf) team reports\.


> After the last evacuation of the Roya area, it is almost impossible to sleep outside, because police patrols all key points in the city\. The city now appears more “ empty “ and quietly “ White “, with good peace of tourists and citizens\.
 

> Despite this, people continue to arrive in town and cross the border, largely relying on smugglers: just a few days ago a man was arrested who with a van was carrying 11 boys in exchange for payment of 160 € per head\. As far as areas of origin are concerned, these days we have noticed the increase in Sudanese, Eritreans and general North African migrants\.
 

> The evening distribution of food is made by the French volunteers of the mosque, which the other night guaranteed at least one meal to boys, many of which are fasting for Ramadan month\. 





In these days [Eufemia\-Info&Legal Point](https://www.facebook.com/EufemiaVentimiglia/) continues with mobile and internet services, even if the turnout has slightly dropped\.
