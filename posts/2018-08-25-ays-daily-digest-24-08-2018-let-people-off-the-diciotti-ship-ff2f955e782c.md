#### Feature

[_Die Presse_](https://diepresse.com/home/ausland/eu/5485436/Italien-empoert_Keine-Einigung-in-Bruessel-ueber-Migranten-an) reports that a meeting of twelve EU states ended inconclusively, as no solution has been found for the 150 people aboard the Italian Coast Guard ship Diciotti\. Italy refuses to let the people disembark and demands that other EU countries also accept refugees who arrive on its shores\. The EU’s partners rejected the request of the Italian Government on the grounds that the number of migrants arriving in Italy this year had fallen sharply\. [_La Repubblica_](https://www.repubblica.it/politica/2018/08/24/news/di_maio_migranti_ue_diciotti_fico-204808306/?ref=RHPPLF-BH-I0-C8-P1-S1.8-T1) reports that Deputy Prime Minister Di Maio insisted Italy is ready to cut its EU contributions and act unilaterally to solve the issue\. [_Le Monde_](https://abonnes.lemonde.fr/europe/article/2018/08/24/l-union-europeenne-ne-propose-pas-de-solution-pour-les-migrants-du-diciotti_5345902_3214.html) says countries present at the meeting did not want to give the impression of giving in to blackmail, while recognising the urgency of a humanitarian solution\. One diplomat said that the EU needs to create permanent mechanisms for the reception of boats and the redistribution of refugees\. [Seebrücke](https://www.facebook.com/SeebrueckeSchafftsichereHaefen/) says many German cities have already declared that they are willing to accept more refugees\. The organisation is currently organising [massive European protests](https://seebruecke.org/european-protests-events/) to protest against Italy’s and the EU’s policy at sea\.

Meanwhile, journalist Eleonora Camilli says that there are only two bathrooms for the 150 people aboard the ship, and that there are already 69 cases of scabies, of which five are advanced\.

Refugees on board the ship had started a hunger strike in response to Salvini’s intransigence\. However, the strike ended after a visit from several members of Parliament\. Journalist Sergio Scandura quotes President of the Health Committee of the Sicilian Parliament La Rocca la Ruvolo as saying that women aboard the ship have asked for a gynecological visit because of the sexual violence they have experienced in Libya\. Meanwhile, the ship’s captain has asked for an urgent disembarkation because of the ship’s “critical condition,” according to an ANSA print article\.

The prosecutor of Agrigento has opened an investigation for the illegal detention of the people on board\. [Borderline Sicilia and the Catanese anti\-racist network](https://www.borderlinesicilia.org/cs-borderline-sicilia-rete-antirazzista-catanese/) have also filed a complaint to the Catania public prosecutor, accusing the Government of kidnapping and of torture, as the prolonged stay aboard the ship is inadequate for this large number of people, especially given the psychological state they are in, their severe state of malnutrition, and the conspicuous signs of torture suffered during their imprisonment in Libya\.

As the minors were evacuated from the ship, journalists have been able to discover more about the conditions they were living in in Libya\. Journalist [Eleonora Camilli](http://www.redattoresociale.it/Notiziario/Articolo/592870/I-racconti-raccapriccianti-dei-minori-sbarcati-dalla-Diciotti) says that one of the boys has a gunshot wound and a paralyzed hand\. Another one has vision problems because he lived in the dark for an entire year\. All have spent from one to three years in Libyan prisons\. This comes as the [UNHCR](http://news.trust.org/item/20180824153647-pnc6b) says that conditions in Libyan detention centres are actually worsening, due to “overcrowding and lack of basic living standards”\.
#### Italy

[Chez Jesus](https://www.facebook.com/Chez-Jesus-Rifugio-Autogestito-362786637540072) says police violence is intensifying in the village of Claviere, two kilometers away from the French border\. People walking along mountain paths are being arrested, and police are even threatening with their guns \. The military has now joined them as well\. The border police is also using violence in order to force refugees to record their fingerprints\. One 16\-year\-old boy has given his testimony:


> They started hitting me to force me to leave my fingerprints\. One time, than a second time, much harder\. Two people came came as reinforcements \(…\) One of the four policemen threw me to the ground and used his nightstick to hit me on the head and knees \(…\) they put me in the car and threw me on the road, just on the other side of the border”\. 





From the 19th to the 23rd of September, [Camp Passamontagna](http://www.passamontagna.info) will provide an opportunity for activists to share experiences, practices and ideas among those who have chosen to fight for a world without authority and borders\. The camp will be held at the French\-Italian border at the Colle del Monginevro:

The camp is meant to be completely self\-organized, a place for activists to discuss together in a horizontal manner and to share practices of struggle, of organizing, reflections and perspectives, and to keep on fighting against all the tentacles of the border control system\.

The [Association Marocaine des Droits Humains — Section Nador](https://www.facebook.com/AmdhNador/) says arrests of migrants are continuing at the Moroccan coast, with eight buses leaving Tangier for the south of Morocco this morning, as the country tries to prevent people from leaving for Europe\. 70 people were arrested in total\. Two buses left Nador at 9PM; the passengers on board included migrants who have a Moroccan residence card\.

Salvamento Maritimo has rescued 184 people from three boats in the sea between Morocco and Spain\. Ali Zoubeidi on Twitter says that two boats with 37 people arrived in the Canary Islands, describing the route there from Morocco as a “very risky route”\.

Meanwhile, [El Pais](https://elpais.com/elpais/2018/08/23/inenglish/1535032545_735013.html) reports that the Spanish government has sent 116 people who managed to get over the border fence on Wednesday at the Spanish North African exclave city of Ceuta back to Morocco\. The operation is based on an agreement that Spain and Morocco signed in 1992 on the readmission of foreigners who illegally enter Spanish territory\. [SOS Racism](https://sosracismo.eu/las-devoluciones-ejecutadas-en-ceuta/) o says 48 organisations have protested against the returns, arguing that the government did not take into account the potential vulnerability of these people, including their minority status, possibility of exercising their right to seek asylum, and status as victims of human trafficking\.

[Aegean Boat Report](https://www.facebook.com/AegeanBoatReport/) : three boats carrying 140 people have made the crossing towards Lesvos on Friday morning, while one boat with 46 people arrived on Samos\.

[Refugee Rescue](http://refugeerescue.co.uk) is looking for a Farsi speaker to help them in their search and rescue operations in northern Lesvos, as more and more people arriving on Lesvos are Farsi speakers\. More volunteering opportunities can be found on [Volunteering4Refugees](https://v4r.info/) \.
#### Croatia
### New testimonies of police violence

[No Name Kitchen](https://www.facebook.com/NoNameKitchenBelgrade/?tn-str=k%2AF) reports on yet another case of police violence at the Croatian border:


> “They took my friend outside and closed the door\. I could not see through the door as there were no windows, but I could hear how they were beating him\. This took around 5 minutes\. After, they told me to go out of the car and I knew I was going to be beaten\. Two police took my hands and one was beating me with a plastic baton into my back, legs, and everywhere\. After, they put me on the ground and kept beating me\. Their faces were red, and I could smell alcohol from them\. I was trying to escape, but I fell into the water\. They shouted at me to go back to Bosnia\. I run to a little hill and fell down\.”

#### Hungary
### Hungary must provide food to rejected asylum seekers

Hungary must provide food to rejected asylum seekers held in detention camps on its border who are appealing the decision, the European Court of Human Rights has said\.

The Helsinki Committee had said that Hungarian authorities had refused food to some asylum seekers held in the two border camps while they await the outcome of their asylum appeals\.

The Helsinki Committee says that all asylum\-seekers in transit zones are now getting food after it successfully got interim orders for 8 people from the European Court of Human Rights\. It says, “W _e welcome that no one is starved now, but under current law, asylum\-seekers could still be denied food_ ”\.
#### France
### Police confiscation continues in Paris

In Paris, [La Cuisine des Migrants](https://www.facebook.com/CuisineDesMigrants/) reports that police have again thrown away mattresses, blankets and personal items from the Collectif Schaeffer, a group of undocumented people who were living in unfit housing in Aubervilliers and were evicted beginning of August\. They are in urgent need of mattresses in particular, which can be brought to the Cuisine des Migrants or directly to the Square Schaeffer in Aubervilliers\.

In Dunkirk, the [Refugee Womens Centre](https://www.dunkirkrefugeewomenscentre.com/single-post/2018/08/22/New-Opportunity-as-RWC-seek-Women%E2%80%99s-Support-Worker) needs a Women’s Support Worker starting October\. The volunteer will be focusing on supporting vulnerable women through administrative casework and organisation of activities and workshops jointly with the rest of the team\.
