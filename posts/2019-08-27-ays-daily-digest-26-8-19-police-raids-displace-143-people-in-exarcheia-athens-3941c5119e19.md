### Feature: Police Raids displace 143 people in Exarcheia, Athens

Monday morning, police raided squats in Exarcheia, Athens; [the desired effect](https://twitter.com/exiledarizona/status/1165873714568867840) was to remove anyone without identification in order to clear out refugees and destabilize the anarchist movement\. The brutal outcome was that [143 people](https://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2019/08/26/exarchia-police-refugees-squats) , including a large number of children, were forced to leave their homes and were sent to Aliens Directorate\.

[The four](https://twitter.com/exiledarizona/status/1165883768508420096) confirmed raids happened in Gare, Spirou Trikoupi 17, Rosa de Fok, and Clantestina\. The police were heavily armed at all of the raids, adding to the sense of fear and the racist belief of establishing security in the neighborhood\.

One police spokesman, in a [blantently racist statement](https://thepressproject.gr/ekprosopos-tis-astynomias-charaktirizi-anthropous-os-skoupidia-ke-skoni/?fbclid=IwAR2zg0wvlWQNWSC0e-bKSUnMBc1DOoQbsEYlBDOaHpLSn9UaDi3hLOHphVQ) , went as far afterwards to refer to the evicted people as ‚Äúrubbish‚Äù and ‚Äúdust‚Äù that the police ‚Äúvacuum cleaners‚Äù must suck up\.

- No cars can get in from most streets

- Helicopter hovering, unmarked police cars all over

- Only mainstream reporters allowed to film 

- Over 100 arrests

**Some important things to know for immediate action:**

[NoBorders](https://twitter.com/Refugees_Gr/status/1166127314146603015) reports that: _‚ÄúFrom the refugee affidavits today, we learned that ten people without papers were transferred to Amygdala\. There is a need for solidarity and legal support\.‚Äù_

Also, you can still apply for asylum while in detention\! Learn more [here](https://www.facebook.com/refucomm/posts/914621755556294?hc_location=ufi) \.

Finally, the solidarity assembly held on Monday evening had a great turnout, but more work needs to be done in order to prevent future evictions and protect the people affected\.

### Morocco


![‚ÄúVisiting the Bekoya camp of migrants in Nador, AMDH Nador has found that the humanitarian situation is getting worse every day despite the fact that Ngos are providing important funding to help of migrants\.

AMDH Nador also reports that new military camps are being built in the forests near the camp\. _‚ÄúMorocco is mobilizing its military device to repression and hunt down simple migrants\.‚Äù_ Find out more [here](https://www.facebook.com/AmdhNador/photos/a.1693125780899690/2399797453565849/?type=3&theater) \.
### Libya


[![Security Check Required]( "Security Check Required")](https://www.facebook.com/sally.hayden.12/posts/10156214859857085)


Thank you to independent journalists who keep fighting the good fight in order to bring to light the darkness facing humanity\.

Also, everyone should check out this very creative music video, ‚Äò [new Eritrean music‚Äô made from inside Zintan detention centre:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0584FWdGQvc&fbclid=IwAR2qkiGAmRFQ4SEPRxAEeX39RcSEsf_lmXC3oStZUpfX4NZp5jl5Zacm6LU)


> ‚ÄúThe title of lyric says ‚Äòwe make an engagement with death‚Äô in Zintan\. That we are near to death within UNHCR\. That means we are weary\. We are mourning the deaths of our brothers who are not buried\. We are recommending to professionals to raise up our crying, our pain to the EU\.‚Äù 




### Greece

[New arrivals](https://www.facebook.com/AegeanBoatReport/posts/637392810117160?__xts__[0]=68.ARChTonJU8wH9964BUatBGmlmMexEMn_fGqJnJUyaR7s80rr42l3tZqTB9DDhuqYlD9y6WoRNJI8b6pNCE8GyJILNGJl12tLXCk3exydN92C8Tp3YUn4UQrb2KwUUZj858CbXjLQnR9LoFEoOdjxWheIPA8-ad9y_ccgbFB-Ecik81ObdJdWae5YnvUw-iCLiytUaSJtVqnozXVJrj-bXm9o6Uj2xR6m0DckpiT0qKfputhsMC6mD27BlpZoPNkCevKNGzgqc0HUpURuvnoUJKd1z2u2KrtD7u6jRKjiBlN-ZN--rS1O1WqAsQg5E6U4bNdnHIbqwpwdLV5b4-JY9Ag&__tn__=-R) to the Greek Islands according to Aegean Boat Report: 14 boats total on Monday, carrying a total of **228 people\.**

First boat ‚Üí Lesvos, 9 people

Second boat ‚Üí Lesvos, 22 people

Third boat ‚Üí Lesvos, 40 people \(17 children, 11 women, 12 men\)

Fourth boat ‚Üí Lesvos, 38 people \(18 children, 9 women, 11 men\)

Fifth boat ‚Üí Lesvos, 31 people \(5 children, 4 women, 22 men\)

Sixth boat ‚Üí Lesvos, 46 people \(24 children, 12 women,10 men\)

Seventh boat ‚Üí Lesvos, 42 people \(18 children, 10 women,14 men\)

Eighth boat ‚Üí Samos,48 people

Two boats arrived on Farmakonisi, transported to Leros, 67 people 
\(Numbers not confirmed\) \. Another 55 people were transported from Simi to Leros\.

_‚ÄúThree boats have been reported arrived on Simi, unfortunately no further information available\. Also one boat reported arrived on Kos, no further information available\.‚Äù_

6 people were killed and another 10 injured in a smuggling jeep accident, close to the Turkish border\. It is unclear what caused the accident\. For more [information click here](http://www.ekathimerini.com/243929/article/ekathimerini/news/greek-police-say-six-migrants-killed-10-hurt-in-road-crash?fbclid=IwAR13hia0A1Nt2eDwHRpYER0-yc65xT-rwnhPqmZwzBX60qQ9UqkoRVIOS54) \.
### Croatia

Worrying images confirm what had earlier been reported about the practice of unlawful detention by the Croatian police in places that are unfit to host humans\. They use these secret locations as part of the process of collective expulsions to Bosnia and Herzegovina\. People are held for a day \(or even longer\) locked up in a filthy garage, without any access to hygiene facilities, place to rest, proper ventilation, food, not to mention legal aid and information, or mechanism of demanding international protection\. What is the difference between this, what the EU is doing, and the same sights in Libya that the EU is so shocked by?
