Aegean Boat Report
#### **FEATURED**

Greek Defense Minister Nikos Panagiotopoulos called on NATO to strengthen their presence in the Aegean at a meeting in Brussels Thursday\. During the conference, Panagiotopoulos met with his Turkish counterpart, Hulusi Akar\. The two exchanged views on how their countries’ military delegations could help reduce tension in bilateral relations\. Talks about implementing confidence\-building measures are scheduled to start in Athens on Monday\.


> “ _Military actions, such as those in northern Syria, and agreements with the Tripoli government in Libya, in breach of international law, are of great concern to us as they contribute to destabilizing the Eastern Mediterranean\.”_ 





These talks took place amid rising tensions in Greece\. Fascist attacks on people on the move and asylum seekers are increasing often under the nose of police\. Recent reports highlight that there seems to be a large contingent of Greek police who support the fascist Golden Dawn party, whose members have [violently attacked refugees](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2015/10/13/goda-o13.html) and are accused of murdering leftist hip\-hop musician Pavlos Fyssas\. The online journal _Sto Nisi_ has also reported far\-right posts on social media spreading lies about refugees to insight violence and hatred\.

One of the posts reads:


> _“_ In Mytilini we will take up arms\! We are already sleeping with them\! There are rumors that a group of locals is planning to blow up the Moria hot spot\! There will be war\! It’s no longer a question of racism\. If this is true we will be with them\. Yesterday \[refugees\] tried to blow up the PPC power plant\. These invaders have taken over our islands\!” 





Risks are increasing for NGOs operating in Greece as well as the fact that they are under continuous attack from the Greek State\. These types of policies were similarly pursued under Syriza, who [jailed Sara Mardini](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2018/09/10/gree-s10.html) and three other members of the ERCI \(Emergency Response Centre International\) for helping\. Last week, at the insistence of ND, the Greek parliament passed a law restricting the activities of NGOs\. Greece’s prime minister remarked that the new law will prevent NGOs from operating “unchecked” and they will be “strictly vetted\.”


> These growing pressures all come amid reports of illegal pushbacks by police at the border \(videos and NGO reports documenting their actions\) and increasing danger for those attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea\. 




Protests on all sides are growing as well\. In Athens on Friday, residents of the North Aegean islands of Lesvos, Chios and Samos protested outside the Ministry of Interior, marching to the House of Representatives with signs reading “Not another Moria\.” At the protest in Greece, some banners called for “illegal migrants” to be expelled and for the country’s borders to be closed\. But some demonstrators chased off former deputies and senior figures in the neo\-Nazi “Golden Dawn” party after they joined the protest, an _AFP_ news agency journalist witnessed\.

Aegean Boat Report took to Facebook Friday to denounce Greek officials for denying the entry of a Norwegian delegation to Moria last week\. This is the first time this delegation has been denied entry to evaluate a situation\.


> “We wanted to visit the Greek islands to look at the conditions there\. Greek authorities refuse us entry\. It is something they don’t want the world to see\. That the situation is so dangerous that they will not let us in, says it all\.” 





Norwegian foreign minister Ine Eriksen Søreide \(H\) will ask the Greek government to reevaluate the request\. Norway has contributed financially to the Greek government to improve living conditions for people living in camps on the Greek islands\. To refuse entry seems strange if they have nothing to hide\.

Thirty\-four people from Afghanistan arrived in the Chios port Friday\. All arrived safely and were healthy\.

#### **ITALY**

The Spanish ship, Aita Mari, was finally allowed to dock in the Sicilian port of Messina Friday after waiting several days at sea with 158 rescued migrants on board\.

On Monday, the crew of the vessel had [picked up 60 migrants](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/22686/spain-rescues-119-migrants-searches-for-67-missing-at-sea) in waters in the central Mediterranean\. This was in addition to the 93 people, including 13 children and 16 women, were rescued in the first operation on Sunday\.

In other news, the Maltese coast guard on Thursday rescued the passengers of another vessel in distress in Mediterranean waters\. According to German NGO Sea\-Watch, some 60 people on board had to wait for 18 hours after they had made a call for help before finally being rescued\.

Authorities in #Malta and #Italy again put lives of about 60 people at risk.

Alarm phone took to twitter to blame Italy and Malta for playing games with people’s lives, in response to their delayed actions after boats call for assistance in the sea\.


> “18 hours later: the people in distress are still out at sea\. A new record of non\-assistance\. The boat has been adrift for many hours as the engine doesn’t work properly\.”

#### **FINLAND**


> _“These children have no hopes for future\. The European Union turning its back completely on Greece — to the agony, the humanitarian crisis of these people — is shameful from the viewpoint of its values\.”_ 




Finnish Minister of the Interior Maria Ohisalo called out the EU for turning its back on Greece\. 
Ohisalo stated that her colleagues from other member states put pressure on her to help the children \(unaccompanied minors\) in what is quickly becoming a critical situation\. She also called attention to our common humanity and the risk Finland might one day face\.


> _“We’re also a country with a long external border\. If we find ourselves in a pickle someday, I sure hope we’ll get help\.”_ 





When asked about the ages of the children who could be re\-settled in Finland, Ohisalo responded, “I think the discussions we’ve had in the government have recognized that we should try to help children in the most difficult situations\.” It has been reported that around 10 per cent of the 5,000 underage asylum seekers living in the camps are under 14 years old\.

The Finnish government, she also reminded, has agreed to maintain its annual refugee quota at 850–1,050 for the entirety of the electoral term\.
#### **SWITZERLAND**

The federal court in Switzerland has ruled that a _recognized refugee_ receiving disability insurance in Switzerland is entitled to claim disabled people’s child benefit, even if their children do not live in Switzerland\.

The [Geneva Convention](https://www.unhcr.org/1951-refugee-convention.html) on refugees, ratified by Switzerland, states that recognized refugees should be treated the same as Swiss citizens when it comes to social security issues, the Court said in a ruling made public on Friday\.

The case concerned a man from Chad who was recognized as a refugee by Switzerland in 1994 and who has been receiving disability insurance since 2005\. When he requested the disabled people’s child benefit for his two daughters who were living in France with their mother, the authorities in Bern refused\. The man went through the courts for his claim, ending up at Switzerland’s highest court\.

Officials now have to look into whether all the conditions for issuing the child benefit have been met, including whether recognition of paternity issued in France is valid in Switzerland\.
#### **GERMANY**

Al Jazeera reported Friday that 12 German citizens of a far\-right group were arrested for reportedly ‘planning an attack against politicians, asylum seekers and Muslims’\. The suspects wanted their attacks to create havoc and an atmosphere of fear that resembles a civil war, reported the Federal Prosecutor’s Office \(GBA\) \.


> “The goal of the organization was to shake and eventually destroy the democratic system and social cohesion of the federal republic\.” 





In response to growing far right sentiments over the last few years, the German government has launched efforts to fight and prevent violence\. This includes the new measures approved after the killing of a pro\-immigration politician and a deadly [attack](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/fatal-shooting-german-synagogue-191009114733618.html) on a synagogue and kebab shop in Halle by an anti\-Semitic gunman\. The reforms include tougher gun ownership laws and stricter monitoring of hate speech online\. Germany’s domestic intelligence agency estimates there are about 24,100 “right\-wing extremists” in Germany, about half of whom are potentially violent\. Attacks are increasing as well, in that half 2019 there were nearly 9,000 attacks by far\-right groups\.
