#### GENERAL
### Alde Group urges EU member states to clarify the situation of all refugee and migrant minors\.


> _The ALDE Group \(Alliance for Democrats and Liberals for Euorope\) has called on the European agency and EU member states to clarify the situation of all the refugee and migrant minors once they enter European territory\. They are appalled by the fact that 10,000 refugee children have disappeared during the last months according to EUROPOL\. MEP Hilde Vautmans said “This bureaucratic indifference cannot rule our moral standards,” adding that “When a dog is missing, people post emergency messages on their Facebook pages\. But when we are faced with the biggest number of displaced children since World War Two, we all get lost in the myriad of institutions\. It’s a disgrace”\. Additionally, ALDE Group has requested information with regards to the registration of those minors\. They also urged member states to take measures to prevent these missing children from ending up in criminal environments\._

> _Assembly from the Stone Building at the port of \#Piraeus, a place where 1500 lived for the last two months, issued a statement saying that they have decided to dissolve their collective due to the great pressures on solidarity that span from accusations aimed at volunteers, to making volunteers and NGOs comply with humiliating processes of dividing refugees into groups considered deserving of better accommodation and those who do not apply for asylum\. For more information, please read the full statement [http://bit\.ly/1VUdlZa](http://bit.ly/1VUdlZa)_

> _“Needless to say that created tensions all around in trying to manage so many more people along with the dislike Afghans and Syrians have for each other\. There were a number of new navy personnel on hand to help\. Our warehouse continues to be quite unmanageable without light, lots of dust and boxes everywhere\. We barely managed to give out some clothing to the new arrivals but the window the navy gave us was a little over an hour\. The navy, since they are human too, are struggling to handle their work especially since they have no experience with refugees\. It’s shared chaos\! Nothing has changed as far as access to the camp by volunteers\. No independents allowed and only NGOs who have registered with the Ministry of the Interior are permitted,” volunteers reported\._ 




### Alexandria Camp still looking for a medical team\. Medical staff and translators are also needed in two camps in the mainland\.

### Some advice for volunteers at EKO Gas Station\.


> _Warning for volunteers: be careful when distributing hand warmers \(the ones that look like tea bags\) \. Hand warmers were distributed today without an explanation and refugees mistook them for tea, so please try and explain before handing them out\. Also, volunteers who played with kids and colors washed the kids’ hands with petrol to get the color off, please don’t do that\. Both incidents happened at \#EKOgasstation\. Please be aware that sometimes it is not enough to explain those things in English only, search for a translator if you see that English explanation is not enough\. Keep up the good work\!_

The newspaper added that the authorities plan to pay special attention to vans entering Austria from Hungary\._ 




### Austrian bishop against construction of security fence\.


> _In surprising news, it is nice to see that, unlike in Poland and Croatia, a Roman Catholic bishop has challenged Austria’s plans to construct a fence to keep out refugees by refusing to allow the authorities to build on church land and arguing that it runs contrary to the pope’s wishes\. A fence “would contradict the spirit of the Gospel, Pope Francis’s clear message to Europe, and in particular for a diocese that was in the shadow of the Iron Curtain for decades,” Aegidius Zsifkokvics, the bishop of Eisenstadt, told the AFP news agency\. The proposed fence on the Hungarian border near Moschendorf would cross two properties owned by the church\._ 




#### GERMANY
### Refugees For Refugees petitions against new integration law that doesn’t allow refugees to choose their place of residences freely after asylum approval\. Economist maps most suitable places for refugees to live\.


> _A new “integration” law is in the works in Germany\. The law stipulates that refugees, after asylum approval can not choose their place of residence freely\.

For German readers follow the link [http://bit\.ly/1Nub305](http://bit.ly/1Nub305)_ 





> _On the other side, The Economist came up with the new maps of, by their calculations, the best places for refugees to live\. “By merging figures on job and housing availability provided by Empirica, together with data on violent attacks on migrants from German newspaper Die Zeit, we were able to map districts on a scale of the most\-to\-least suitable for settlement\. We’ve mapped Die Zeit’s figures showing where migrants actually settled in the first half of 2015\. By cross\-comparing the districts identified as “good” or “excellent” in our index, a mismatch is exposed which suggests that refugees might indeed be congregating in the wrong places\.” For more, follow the link\.

#### NORWAY
### Norway offering money to asylum seekers to leave voluntarily\.


> _While Germany’s policies might be questionable and cynical, Norway has gone even further\. The Norwegian Directorate of Immigration \(Utlendingsdirektoratet — UDI\) is offering a 10,000 kroner bonus to asylum seekers to leave voluntarily\. UDI will offer an additional 10,000 kroner to the first 500 asylum seekers who apply for a voluntary return to their home countries\. Beginning on Monday, the offer will run for six weeks on a first\-come, first\-served basis\. “We need to entice more to voluntarily travel back by giving them a bit more money on their way out\. This will save us a lot of money because it is expensive to have people in the asylum centres,” Integration Minister Sylvi Listhaug told broadcaster NRK\._ 





> _The offer entails giving asylum seekers an additional 10,000 kroner in travel expenses on top of the 20,000 kroner already offered\._

We’ve been campaigning to help children in the camps of Calais, Dunkirk and elsewhere in Europe for so long\. Many of those voting against didn’t even show their faces in the chamber\.” They also state that “It’s not the end though: tomorrow the Lords are working on a new amendment and the game of ping pong begins again\.” They also rightfully stated that, “It’s not the “pull\-factor” that the Conservatives should fear\. It’s the history books\.”_
