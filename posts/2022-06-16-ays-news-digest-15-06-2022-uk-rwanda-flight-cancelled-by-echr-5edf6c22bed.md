With just minutes to spare before the flight was due to leave, the European Court of Human Rights prevented the first deportation flight\. Citing “ [real risk of inhuman and degrading treatment](https://twitter.com/JMPSimor/status/1536775864456818688?fbclid=IwAR0NtrWjX6ZQlLIyjiC6P4qYfjAnBRB7-RpRZL3PQavgsx-drQhOlwYTTpQ) \(Art\. 3 ECHR\)”, the UK government was forced to comply, preventing the six remaining people from being deported\.

Of the 37 people originally scheduled to leave, all the others had successful legal challenges\. In July, a further case will be brought before UK courts by NGOs to challenge the legality of the policy\.

The policy would see asylum seekers have their case heard in Rwanda and successful applicants would remain in the African country\. The policy, put forward was a “deterrent” against those arriving by small boats, is set to cost the Government millions\. The scheduled flight alone was due to cost £500,000\. [This thread examines the costs involved\.](https://twitter.com/stand_for_all/status/1536723596202151937?fbclid=IwAR1S9Dab0gNJZSl8u4P28O5cLFfPCqbEq6nIyPP9rmZ4rYnY1A_rxpH-GUY)

A [protest at the Colnbrook Detention Centre](https://twitter.com/StpDeportations/status/1536772981392822272?fbclid=IwAR3VL5I9_lTUC6r1aSOG12gY9lIh8j__KmtjDVBMINKzNQRUdOCZaOJwOYQ) was monitored by a heavy police presence and resulted in arrests of demonstrators\. [Those arrested were subsequently released\.](https://twitter.com/StpDeportations/status/1537001735792771073?fbclid=IwAR1r3AsdeZEEUaJwI8sUyk9twKdY5kaOID5K7VlSUBwtYNOo79MZg171Fg8)

The frequent question asked by British media is why people want to make the dangerous crossing to the UK, having passed through other European countries\. [This thread explores answers to that questions\.](https://twitter.com/SqueakinglyJen/status/1536725423039598593?fbclid=IwAR25fskbVTF33Ldax_OoG1ZY5j6IVaeMSvYEcZ9y55qRYXRQgntL3tnep2M)
#### SERBIA

The number of people entering Serbia is increasing\. There are [200–250 people per day](https://twitter.com/APC_CZA/status/1537111122930802688?fbclid=IwAR25einNFl1BPfT_qtqDO_YwgtO6eOfXxqpoAOrbcS17cNfLPyVsrKqU_AE) entering the country, with an estimated 500 people being illegally expelled from northern countries back to Serbia\. More than a thousand people attempted to claim asylum, with only two applications successful\.
#### UKRAINE

A report has been issued reflecting on the response to the war in Ukraine and the resulting humanitarian crisis\. [Humanitarian Outcomes](https://www.humanitarianoutcomes.org/Ukraine_review_June_2022) analysed data regarding funding and organisations over the three months of the conflict\. This twitter thread pulls out some important points, which demonstrate that local groups have done more of the work and received less of the funding\.

#### POLAND
#### Call for action

Those who have escaped the dangerous conditions of the border are kept in guarded centres\. The conditions of these centres include lack of legal information, no psychological support and a lengthy waiting time\. Hunger strikes have been staged by detainees at four centres in Poland and [No Borders Team](https://www.facebook.com/nobordersteam) are calling for demonstrations\. With World Refugee Day on 20th June, they call for local groups to use creative methods to stage demonstrations and protests\.

#### Suspension of Schengen border code

[The bishop of Ventimiglia has criticised France for their racist border regime](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/41172/ventimiglia-bishop-speaks-out-against-france-over-border-closing-to-migrants?fbclid=IwAR1TqgUvMnX3epgdpt8TZuh36eWoxmaP1BL_IPnxEh0QVi1M2C26Ui3n3ew) \. The border between France and Italy has been subject to a suspension of the Schengen Accords, with ‘Only those with darker skin checked \[for ID\]’\. According to the letter, published on the Diocese website, since the war between Russia and Ukraine, discrimination against people from Africa and Asia has been evident\.

The suspension of the Schengen border code has also resulted in the [illegal rejection of unaccompanied minors\.](https://www.difesapopolo.it/Fatti/Migranti-continuano-i-respingimenti-tra-Italia-e-Francia.-Medu-Rimandati-indietro-anche-i-minori?fbclid=IwAR25fskbVTF33Ldax_OoG1ZY5j6IVaeMSvYEcZ9y55qRYXRQgntL3tnep2M) A more detailed report of this border area can [be found with medical organisation Medu\.](https://mediciperidirittiumani.org/rapporto-dalla-frontiera-alpina-nord-occidentale/?fbclid=IwAR2EXH_Fkq9NIpWH0dK318LRwItD58lAxytgbPlFcZZ8E6lcucbJha-kFwE)

The site created by Catholic Charity Caritas is located in the city of Reggio Calabria in southern Italy\.


> “This place should be a strong signal to both national and European institutions: everyone has the right to leave and we all have the duty to welcome,” [Marco Pagniello](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/41165/cemetery-opens-in-southern-italy-for-migrants-drowned-at-sea?fbclid=IwAR3XuPWbi5BsPyAVCDfGGlTjV8T2mUki741kYvtSwVJQIDW8mOPYib0VKi0)

The system for providing housing was also criticised, detailing that the process is complicated and some people miss their opportunity due to not being able to answer a phone call\.
#### FRANCE

[There has been a protest in Paris with more than a hundred people](https://twitter.com/Utopia_56/status/1536981560485892097?fbclid=IwAR073tN2theMfPFXxQzTygQ41KpwzPeBjJKKELbb2mbV7kb6rnHPOBj3PF4) seeking accommodation\. The protest included 27 pregnant women and more than 60 children who require sufficient accommodation in Paris\. The state was requested to use some of the 500 places being saved for people from Ukraine, but [the State response was negative](https://twitter.com/leafiloche/status/1536832475946700801?fbclid=IwAR0NtrWjX6ZQlLIyjiC6P4qYfjAnBRB7-RpRZL3PQavgsx-drQhOlwYTTpQ) \.

[A trial is to take place regarding a woman](https://twitter.com/cantevict/status/1537091860904218626?fbclid=IwAR3LYNzwfGVnAY6zUxx1Llihy1Rnta2Y8N1ffZPaQlHwyvtrR_fC5osRyYM) who attempted suicide last year by setting herself on fire\. The trial, due to start on 22nd June, concerns an incident which took place in Mavrovouni camp \(nicknamed Moiria 2\) while she was heavily pregnant\. The woman, identified as MM, faces charges of attempted arson\.

A detailed account of a pushback from [Greece to Turkey is recounted here\.](https://alarmphone.org/en/2022/06/15/violating-the-international-ban-on-refoulment/?fbclid=IwAR1d7IIpCK1v-Nl1lRxO-anT_5qAUvTVWx9pFrEeAT4RhMpgkQPViykg5H8) A Turkish citizen was attempting to reach her family in Germany\.

Four people sentenced for their involvement were appealing their sentences when the meeting was adjourned\. Reportedly, a phone call warning of a bomb in the building led to the appeal being adjourned until 6th July\.

A protest is intended to take place on [25th June in Exarchia Square](https://athens.indymedia.org/post/1619188/) in response to the “gentrification” of the area\. The most impoverished people have been gradually excluded from the area\.

Mujakachi suffered a stroke, but as an asylum seeker, wasn’t entitled to treatment\. After years of appeals and hearings, the NHS debt has now been cancelled due to his change in status\. Whilst this was [celebrated as a victory](https://twitter.com/migrantsorg/status/1536981108348403712?fbclid=IwAR0c4SBi67L5OjDgMP7JTJrOchfYphcDO0sqFP1evEmVSn_lamUBnV3scrA) , Mujakachi, who has lived in the UK since the age of four, faces on\-going financial hardship\.
#### SEA and SAR

A large number of operations in the Mediterranean have taken place recently\. Sea Eye 4 was instrumental in the rescue of [416 people in three different operations](https://twitter.com/seaeyeorg/status/1537100561417482245?fbclid=IwAR0e2jE1Obb8F_UFLOf_-oTz3q08VpmPQ3NkseeAA3xm9hzfVQ7Xz5bDmvM) , whilst [rescue vessel Nadir](https://twitter.com/resqship_int/status/1537124499581243394?fbclid=IwAR0c4SBi67L5OjDgMP7JTJrOchfYphcDO0sqFP1evEmVSn_lamUBnV3scrA) assisted in the rescue of around 30 people off the coast of Lampedusa in Italy\.

There was also an incident involving a boat of [103 people who were forced onto a patrol boat of the so\-called Libyan Coast Guard](https://twitter.com/maydayterraneo/status/1537054421569490944?fbclid=IwAR3Qs_pN9UgNtFoekY6fAGZG262M8XdYGPAsX2veBGYE9IOnllSJr_De-p0) \.

This comes as Sea Watch reiterates that their [no\-fly order over the Libyan search and rescue zone](https://twitter.com/seawatch_intl/status/1537141366161133576?fbclid=IwAR1S9Dab0gNJZSl8u4P28O5cLFfPCqbEq6nIyPP9rmZ4rYnY1A_rxpH-GUY) endangers lives\.
