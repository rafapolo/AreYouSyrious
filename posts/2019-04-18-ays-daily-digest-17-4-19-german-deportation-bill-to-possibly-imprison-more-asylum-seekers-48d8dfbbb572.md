### Feature

On Wednesday, the German Cabinet passed a deportation draft bill designed to speed up the deportation of asylum seekers\. [Supporters](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/16378/changes-to-deportation-better-integration-german-cabinet-decides-on-new-draft-of-migration-law?fbclid=IwAR32971fJgZjzkA4svdndgRzgPYWvFgMjrA0cmeAfdy3AUHhRUGWqTNwQV0) of the bill state this will help people who are able to receive asylum gain more access to integration\. Yet the enormous response from critics suggests that more asylum seekers will end up in prison and that the bill contravenes European law\.

### Libya

[UNHCR](https://twitter.com/UNHCRLibya/status/1118569688160702465) is continuing to try and move people from detention centers engulfed in the fighting in Libya\. they are urging for solutions for “all trapped and detained refugees in Libya\.” They say that the most vulnerable need to be transferred out of the country, but really no one should be trapped in Libya in the first place\.

Those relocated today are among those most vulnerable and include women and children. https://t.co/5MG8L4O26I

### EU

The European Agency for Border and Coast Guard \(EBCG\), aka Frontex, is only getting more powerful ahead of the upcoming EU Parliamentary elections\. In [an interview with Matthias Monroy](https://digit.site36.net/) , an activist specializing in EU police forces, he stated:


> “First of all, there is the establishment of a force of 10,000 troops to prevent border crossings at the external borders or to carry out deportations\. This is something completely new, because so far the Border Agency has only had civilian staff\.” 





The focus of Frontex is still on North Africa, and they have even started **flying planes FOR the Libyan Coast Guard** \. One must only go back to the top of this digest to know why trapping people in Libya, especially given the past few weeks, is despicable\.
