#### FEATURE
#### Greece announced on Monday, only one day after the deadly fire in Moria, a fresh load of measures to “deal” with the increase of new arrivals to the Aegean islands\.

[The Greek government are](http://www.ekathimerini.com/245048/article/ekathimerini/news/greece-announces-fresh-measures-to-deal-with-irregular-migration?fbclid=IwAR0qRGKmRNVGBsxiTzP4XRHer7X9f-iMAdOTngofNqN1nbq5PX1RwFzFJZk) increasing sea patrols\. They are also setting up “closed\-structure pre\-departure centers” for those of whom they deem to have entered illegally and therefore have no right of asylum\. They will try to decongest the islands by moving more people to the mainland\.

[**Their ambitious goal**](https://www.newsit.gr/politikh/ypourgiko-symvoulio-oi-episimes-anakoinoseis-gia-to-prosfygiko/2883855/?fbclid=IwAR3riVUr7xn2XYYRhpb2Jvy7YLAA4hdznUrRMJmrtS70IPUeIHsa_eAsWw8) **is to relocate 40,000 people from the islands to the mainland within 2 months and return 10,000 people to Turkey by 2020\.**

Another relocation program will help 16,000 people live in hotels across the country\. For a full list of changes look [here](https://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2019/09/30/greece-migration-plan-decongestion-returns-asylum-procedures/) \.
#### SEARCH AND RESCUE AT SEA

[12 bodies](https://apnews.com/507d9562ab304fe190e38e0629179f3a) were found from a shipwreck after a boat capsized offshore Morocco\. 5 bodies washed up on Nehla beach in Casablanca\. Departures from Morocco are continuing to increase, in part due to the political constraints in Libya\.

Sea\-Watch reports alarming news that the **Italian authorities knew about a possible shipwreck** and waited 80 hours for the Libyan Coast Guard to get their only to push the people back\.

[An update on the boat](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1178341026890690566) in distress near Malta with 32 people on board:

### Greece
#### Here are the latest updates on the fire that broke out in Moria on Sunday\.


![“ In the media, a story was immediately invented, saying that the refugees themselves set the camp on fire\. It was also stated that they blocked the fire brigade from entering\. We have spoken to many people who witnessed the events directly\. They tell us a very different story\.” Photo by [AlarmPhone](https://www.facebook.com/watchthemed.alarmphone/photos/a.1526182797655958/2465286973745531/?type=3&theater)](assets/98c281147ebf/1*yu9nsFmTSeguAPgsWpTIPg.jpeg)

For a concise breakdown, AYS defers to this summary by journalist [Marianna Karakoulaki‏](https://twitter.com/Faloulah) :


> [“Now let’s put things into perspective](https://twitter.com/Faloulah/status/1178551943242899461) \. Here are the facts: fire breaks out \(a woman die\(s\); many are injured\) — refugees rush to put out the fire before the fire brigade arrives — police respond with teargas — teargas along with fumes create an unbearable atmosphere — riots break out — police keep using teargas — camp is evacuated — those who rush to help are restricted — \(many\) refugees end up in the hospital — the police chief and deputy minister rush to the island\.” 





The Health Ministry reports that 17 people \(9 men, 6 women and 2 children\) were injured and taken to the hospital\.

[There is still confusion](https://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2019/09/30/moria-fire-woman-dead/#.XZIAxXhL9Js.twitter) about whether a child died in the fire as well\. Many reports indicate that the woman that died was carrying a baby who also died\. But DNA evidence was not able to prove this was the case and their was no remains of a baby taken to the morgue, only a bundle of burnt clothing\. The [16 year old daughter](https://thepressproject.gr/faride-tajik-to-onoma-tis-nekris-gynekas-sti-moria-kathistiki-diamartyria-simera-me-chartonia-kamenes-kardies/#.XZInnBQjPo8.facebook) of the women who passed, however, is _“currently receiving psychological support at Mytilene Hospital\.”_
