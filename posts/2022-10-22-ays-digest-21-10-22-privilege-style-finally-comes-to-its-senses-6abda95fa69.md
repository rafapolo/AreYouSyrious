Privilege Style - the airline whose plane was ready to fly to Rwanda in June - has confirmed they WILL NOT fly any refugees to Rwanda!

People power WORKS! 
Now letâ€™s defeat this cruel scheme altogether.

After mounting pressure from activist groups and organisations, led by Freedom from Torture, the airline officials have made a statement saying that they do not plan to follow through with their initial agreements in the Rwanda deal\.

This is a significant step in dismantling the horrific government initiative, and many hope it will lead on to the downfall and breakdown of the Rwanda deal\.

However, due to the political uncertainty in the UK at this time, including the resignation of the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary, it is unclear as to who will take up these positions and whether they will continue to have such a tough and inhumane approach to migration policy\. The future of the Rwanda deal is uncertain but still a very concerning issue, as well as the policies and mechanisms preventing asylum seekers entering the UK through irregular routes, such as by crossing the Channel\.

Aegean Boat Report have also published an article on children who are included in the groups being pushed back at Greek borders\. They provide detailed examples of previous pushbacks that have involved young children and babies\. The Greek government are in direct violation of international and European law, disregarding the right to life, and putting the lives of young children in severe danger\.

#### SLOVAKIA
### Increase in interceptions of individuals crossing into Slovakia

Between 10th and 18th October, [435 undocumented persons were intercepted, and two smugglers were detained](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/44180/border-controls-in-slovakia-lead-to-increased-interception-of-migrant-entries) during border police patrols\.

At the end of September, Czechia imposed temporary border checks that were supposed to be temporary but are still in place\.

Under the policy, people will be banned from crossing the border at any other place along the 251\-kilometer \(155\-mile\) border, with exceptions for farmers, foresters and fishermen working at the border areas\. With an increase in border controls on both sides of the border, the interception of undocumented migration has become more prevalent\.

Other countries, such as, Austria, Hungary, and Slovenia have also imposed temporary border checks with the goal of intercepting more undocumented persons\.

Obviously, these recent increases in border control aim to prevent non\-European asylum seekers, rather than Ukrainian individuals\. Since the war broke out, Slovakia, along with Czechia and Poland, have been major destinations for Ukrainians fleeing the war\.

#### ITALY
### A small village in Southern Italy, Camini, has flourished due to migrant communities

In the 1990s, many inhabitants left Camini, leaving the once lively, bubbly village desolate and quiet\. In the last few years, an influx of migrants from a range of backgrounds has created a dynamic, vibrant place to live\.


> Today about 150 migrants, from Afghanistan, Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, South Sudan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria and Syria, live in Camini, making it one of the municipalities on the peninsula with the highest rate of immigrants among its population\. Their presence alone has sparked an outpouring of solidarity from organizations that have injected money into the village coffers\. 





Rosario Zurzolo, a Camini local, co\-founded the EuroCoop Camini Cooperative to encourage individuals to stay in Camini through financial support and economic opportunities\. The cooperative employs 18 refugees who run workshops in ceramics, woodwork, clothing, and art\.


> We wouldnâ€™t be here without the migrants\. Everyone would have left Camini â€” Rosaro Zurzolo

AlarmPhone is in contact with a boat in distress. The group fled from #Libya but ran out of fuel and is drifting in international waters. Wind and waves are increasing and we fear for their lives! Rescue is needed now! https://t.co/FLdPyRwST8
