> > @[Armed_Forces_MT](https://twitter.com/Armed_Forces_MT) We can now confirm that the people who called us were rescued &amp; disembarked in #Malta! Still, we condemn the delays in rescue - they could have been lethal. Some of the people are injured &amp; spent several years in detention in #Libya. They now need a free &amp; safe life in #Europe.

> “Approximately 70 inmates around one o’clock in the night began to damage the camp to try to make it useless: demolition separation walls, torn windows, destroyed furniture\. The protest lasted at least two hours and was suppressed by police and carabinieri in riot gear, also resorting to very dangerous tear gas launches in the closed environments of the detention center\.”

> “As winter draws in, the healthcare need in Northern France increases\. The situation in Dunkirk remains grim\.

### EU

[The EU has failed](https://www.dw.com/en/eu-breaks-promise-of-safe-passage-for-50000-refugees/a-50803664?fbclid=IwAR15bYmkb52mxuBk1jEtxgZ0qwxW599r-vyrmYvOf951sbaQK8XPlscrfQk) to live up to a promise to admit 50,000 refugees by the end of this month\. The EU launched a 2 year resettlement program with a October 31st, 2019 deadline, but only 37,520 people have come to Europe through the program so far\. Many of the people waiting are still in Libya\. Here is a quota of several countries so far:
