A pro\-refugee march in Mytiline ended in the occupation of a Syriza building in the centre of the town, calling for Greece to \#opentheislands\. According to the No Border Kitchen, the other demand is to free Hesam Shaeri Hesari, one of the hunger strikers who was detained and currently fears being deported\.

Human Rights Watch and other human rights and humanitarian aid organizations wrote an [open letter](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/10/23/greece-asylum-seekers-abysmal-conditions-islands) to Prime Minister Tsipras a month ago, calling on him to end the Greek government’s policy of confining asylum seekers to the Aegean islands\. The situation has not improved and 20 human rights and aid groups have [reiterated these demands today](https://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/pressreleases/2017-11-22/greece-winter-nears-asylum-seekers-stuck-tents-islands) , with the IRC’s country director in Greece, Jana Frey, saying:


> “Lives will be lost — again — this winter — unless people are allowed to move, in an organised and voluntary fashion, to the mainland” 




As of 20 November 2017, the hotspots on Lesvos, Samos, and Chios are hosting 10,925 people in facilities meant for just 3,924\.
### Volunteers needed

[The Schoolbox project](https://www.schoolboxproject.org) needs new volunteers in Andravida, given a sudden surge in new residents at the LM Village Camp\.

[ERCI is looking to hire](http://ercintl.org/careers/) a Greek\-speaking medical coordinator for its clinic in the Moria camp on Lesvos\.

### ReVi needs help

[ReVi](https://www.revifamily.org/) , an organisation that helps families with job opportunities, education, and emergency aid in Izmir, needs financial support as it says it has no money to pay for its programmes starting next week\. Small [donations](https://www.revifamily.org/support) as well as shopping through their [online store](https://www.revifamily.org/store) are welcomed\. The group is also looking for long\-term solutions through grants and sponsorships\.

The Aquarius rescued more than 400 people aboard an overcrowded wooden boat\. More than a third of them were women and there were also “ _many young, very, very thin kids_ ” according to Megan Williams of CBC\. Those rescued also include a three\-day\-old baby and a woman who went into labor in Libya\.
### Protests against slave trade in Libya

Protests against the slave trade in Libya continue\. **Several demonstrations took place in Sweden** , including Gothenburg, Stockholm, and Uppsala, where the demonstration was attacked by a group of Nazis, injuring at least two **\. In Paris,** another protest took place in front of the Libyan embassy this Friday\. **In Berlin** , hundreds protested in front of the embassy on Saturday and another protest is planned in **Cologne** [this Monday](https://enoughisenough14.org/2017/11/25/cologne-demo-call-stop-enslavement-in-libya/) \.

**In Italy, the Medici per i Diritti Umani \(MEDU\) NGO gave a letter to Marco Minniti, Minister of the Interior,** during his visit to the Pozzallo hot spot, denouncing the human rights violations suffered by refugees in Libya\. The letter is based on more than 2,600 direct testimonies given to doctors and psychologists over the last three years\.

[Reuters](http://news.trust.org/item/20171125144419-nse5j/) **reports Ivory Coast president Alassane Ouattara has called on the International Criminal Court to indict the criminals who are selling black African migrants in Libyan slave markets** \. Reuters adds that many West Africans and the United Nations Human Rights office accuse Europe of facilitating the abuses by co\-opting Libya to try to reduce the migrant flow, without taking much interest in how they achieve this\. [The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/2017/11/25/libya-coast-guard-europe-refugees/) also points out that:


> “ _European governments are financing, funding, training, and to some degree, coordinating, a Coast Guard that both the United Nations and the European Commissioner for Human Rights have [found](https://www.coe.int/en/web/commissioner/-/commissioner-seeks-clarifications-over-italy-s-maritime-operations-in-libyan-territorial-waters) to be “directly involved in human rights violations” and exposing migrants “to a real risk of torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment\._ ”
