Days after first requesting a POS \(Port of Safety\), with 11 requests now made, Malta and Italy have still not given a positive response to Humanity 1‚Äôs request to land\. A seven\-month\-old\-baby and 100 unaccompanied minors are amongst those on board\.

The medical conditions of those on board are serious\. One individual was airlifted on 27/10, and a flu\-like infection has been spreading\. _SOS Humanity_ report that [_‚ÄúSeveral of the survivors carry traces of violence they suffered on their journey, including wounds from gunshots and beatings\.‚Äù_](https://sos-humanity.org/en/press/179-survivors-on-board-humanity-1-sos-humanity-urgently-calls-for-a-place-of-safety/)

MSF‚Äôs ship ‚Äî the Geo Barents ‚Äî rescued 268 people within four hours, from four different vessels, within Malta‚Äôs SAR zone\. The Maltese government‚Äôs inaction is becoming habit, and MSF write that:


> ‚ÄúWe are outraged that the Armed Forces of Malta has neglected its legal obligation to coordinate the rescues and provide assistance, even though the relevant authorities have been informed from the very first moment\.‚Äù 




Whilst temporarily safe aboard the Geo Barents, the lack of allocated safe ports is becoming a worrying feature of NGO rescues in the Mediterranean ‚Äî workers aboard the ship come under increasing pressure as time goes on: supplies dwindle, medical needs increase and fatigue sets in\. Furthermore, the time delays before landing enforced by EU nations not only acutely impact all those on board, but restrict the availability humanitarian vessels have to complete rescues, and subsequently restricts the number of people they might reach\.


> ‚ÄúThere are currently another two other humanitarian vessels with hundreds more irregular migrants who were rescued in international waters between Libya and Malta ‚Äî SOS M√©diterran√©e‚Äôs Ocean Viking with 234 on board and SOS Humanity‚Äôs Humanity 1, which is carrying 180 rescued people aboard\. None of the ships have, however, been able to make port anywhere nearby as of Sunday afternoon\. 





> MSF‚Äôs Geo Barents was west of Malta and south of Sicily, the Ocean Viking was west of Malta and south of Sicily and the SOS Humanity was well north of Malta and east of Sicily with, between then, hundreds of rescued irregular migrants aboard needing to reach terra firma to receive proper care\.‚Äù 





With Giorgia Meloni‚Äôs more right\-wing Italian government in power, Italy is once again closing its ports to NGO ships\. This happened before, between 2018 and 2019, when there were **[‚Äúmajor standoffs between the Maltese and Italian governments over responsibility for rescued irregular migrants\.‚Äù](https://theshiftnews.com/2022/10/31/msf-appalled-outraged-by-maltas-inaction-in-its-search-and-rescue-zone/)**

On Twitter, Matteo Salvini wrote \(referring to Ocean Viking and Humanity 1\) that: ‚ÄúThe first has a Norwegian flag while the second is German\. Let NGOs set course for their countries, not Italy\.‚Äù

The deflection of humanitarian obligations in the Mediterranean SAR zone is reflective of an overall trend, with Italy following Malta‚Äôs stance of non\-action: choosing to look away\. As pressure increases on asylum reception systems in Europe and humanitarian operations at sea, the answer to the question of ‚Äòwhat happens next?‚Äô looks increasingly frightening\.

Following the petrol bombing of an asylum facility in Dover, 700 more people arrived at Manston on 31/10\. The BBC has reported that numbers have reached 4,000 people, whilst the official capacity is capped it 1,600\.

> ‚ÄúThe processing centres have now suffered a breakout of the bacterial disease dipthheria, as well as the skin condition scabies‚Äù 





and this is the direct result of legal violations: under UK law, detention is limited to 24 hours whilst asylum seekers are processed and undergo ‚Äòinitial checks\.‚Äô


> ‚ÄúThey can only hold someone if there is a reasonable prospect of their removal from the country in a sensible timeframe\. She was refusing to sign off on bail or pay for hotels which means she was illegally detaining people\. There is no legal grounds for them to be detained\.

The overcrowding at Manston follows an attack on a UK processing centre for asylum seekers\. On 30/10, a man threw petrol bombs at the centre near Dover before killing himself\. The motive for the attack is unknown, but comes at a time where the UK‚Äôs public discourse around migration has become increasingly polarised\. Oly yesterday, [Home Secretary Suella Braverman absurdly and dangerously referred to immigration to the UK as an ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/01/bravermans-invasion-claim-not-backed-by-facts-say-experts) \.
#### Channel Crossings: In Perspective

_Freemovement_ has looked through the data on immigration to the UK, and illustrates how the front\-page status of small boat irregular immigration is twisted into a political issue\.


> ‚ÄúIt turns out that over the last year, only one quarter \(26% to be precise\) of refugee arrivals into the UK were by small boats, lorries or other spontaneous means\.‚Äù 






![](assets/9b06c8812614/0*S5EL8zdRuPyAgy49.jpeg)



> ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs stop pretending we‚Äôre too full up or we can‚Äôt cope\. We take far fewer applications than comparable countries\. If we can set up schemes for Hong Kongers and Ukrainians that actually welcome far more people than arrive from the rest of the world combined, why can‚Äôt we extend those schemes to others and offer proper safe and legal routes of entry?‚Äù

This infographic speaks for itself: the backlog is not a correlative of an increase in arrivals\. So what has caused it?

#### Ukrainian refugees fear homelessness in the UK

By next year, thousands of Ukrainian refugees in the UK might find themselves homeless\. The ‚ÄòHomes for Ukraine‚Äô scheme has a minimum of six months \(soon to run out\), and one estimate predicts that 50,000 Ukrainian refugees will subsequently be made homeless\.

The scheme currently pays hosts ¬£350 as a ‚Äòthank you‚Äô payment each month, but as the scheme runs out many households may find themselves unable to support Ukrainians without financial aid\.

#### Pushback of 110 people feared in the Aegean

Aegean Boat Report \(ABR\) have been following a group of people, mostly Afghan families, whose boat broke down in the Ionian sea between Greece and Italy\. A rescue recorded the people being towed towards the Greek village of Foinikounta, but all data and location sharing ended abruptly 550m from the shore\.

There has been no confirmation of any rescue in the area yet from HCG \(Hellenic Coastguard Greece\), and ABR are increasingly worried by the lack of information available 24 hours after the rescue operation began\. No contact with anyone onboard has been confirmed yet\.

All information from ABR is here:

#### Turkey has deported 97,448 refugees this year

Deportations from Turkey have increased by 149% since January 2021, and since 2016 422,957 people have been deported\.

_‚ÄúAlong the T√ºrkiye\-Iran border, stretching 534km, a 295km long wall is being constructed to prevent the irregular entry of migrants\. Mainly Afghans and Pakistanis travel on foot along the borders with Iran to enter T√ºrkiye\. Along the 911km long T√ºrkiye\-Syria border, an 837km wall was finished in 2018\._

_T√ºrkiye hosts the largest refugee population in the world, with a total of around 4 million people\. On October 24, the HRW \(Human Rights Watch\) claimed that authorities in T√ºrkiye arbitrarily arrested, detained, and deported hundreds of men and boys to Syria between February and July\. According to the organization, T√ºrkiye does not meet the EU‚Äôs safe third country criteria for refugees\.‚Äù ‚Äî_ More [here](https://bianet.org/english/migration/269256-turkiye-has-deported-over-97-000-refugees-so-far-this-year-says-ministry?fbclid=IwAR2KTFd8-QCp4HVX6FXqqGJPyoVAgBAJoUMVXtmyrXKDsEnKEMB0IQPREhk) \.

#### Iuventa crew has hearing postponed, again

The Iuventa‚Äôs crew rescued over 14,000 people from unseaworthy vessels from 2016 to 2017\. Now 4 crew members are on trial, charged by Trapani/Italy with ‚Äúaiding and abetting illegal migration\.‚Äù The accusations came to court first in 2022, and trials are on\-going\.


> ‚ÄúOn 29 October 2022 we are in Trapani, and once again the hearing has been postponed ‚Ä¶ and not due to unforeseen events or new evidence, nor for a change in the policy of criminalizing solidarity ‚Äî no, once again a defendant was not properly invited to a meeting relevant to the proceedings, once again the sloppiness and ignorance of the Prosecutor‚Äôs Office led to a delay in the trial\. This shows how easy it is to keep a trial alive, thus maintaining an intimidating effect on the civilian fleet, even if a conviction cannot be obtained\.‚Äù

#### UKRAINE
#### Over six million Ukrainian refugees have returned home, despite being asked not to by Ukrainian officials

Iryna Vereshchuk, Ukraine‚Äôs deputy PM, said on Tuesday that, ‚Äúto return now is to risk yourself and your children, your vulnerable relatives\.‚Äù

In spite of warnings as to the war‚Äôs continuing impact, many Ukrainians remain undeterred in their desire to return\.

Over 7\.75 million Ukrainian refugees have been registered across Europe since Russia invaded Ukraine in February\.

#### EU GENERAL
#### EU drafts a plan to ‚Äòvoluntarily‚Äô share the influx of migration

The EU is discussing a proposal for countries to voluntarily relocate a minimum of 5,000 or 10,000 migrants a year\. Previous attempts to set up a mandatory distribution system were blocked by opposition in Central European nations\.

[_Politico_ report:](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-migration-plan-share-migrant-influx-voluntary/?fbclid=IwAR0pTAEasZE325ZHLjie_7s_RQTucOjnhFJ7-PNwesWkYtwqP_-gmX4C4CA)


> The proposal is set in the framework of ‚Äúflexible solidarity,‚Äù allowing each country to decide whether to take in asylum seekers or offer financial help to countries facing a migration influx\. 





> Under existing law, asylum seekers are required to submit their applications with the first EU country they set foot in\. If they then move within the EU, these migrants can be sent back to that first EU country\. But exemptions for countries facing a large wave of migration are already under consideration\. And the document keeps open the possibility of introducing these exemptions if the Commission cannot find enough volunteers to accept the desired level of asylum seekers\. 





> So far, Mediterranean countries, the main EU access point for migrants arriving from Africa and the Middle East, have welcomed the Czech proposal, according to an EU official\. But countries like Belgium or the Netherlands, desired spots to move once within the EU, are less in favour _\._ 





The policy will be discussed until the end of November\.

On a daily basis, violating international law, Polish border guards pushback asylum seekers attempting to cross the Polish\-Belarus border\. _Human Rights Watch_ report:

> The case, brought by the Polish Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights using reports from Human Rights Watch and other nongovernmental organizations, concerned a Syrian man who, after being hospitalized in Poland, was returned to the Belarus border\. On the basis of a summary expulsion order, he was forced back to Belarus, where he faced serious human rights abuses, including beatings, rape, and restriction on his movement\. The court noted that border guards denied the Syrian man his express wish to apply for asylum in Poland\.‚Äù

1 million Ukrainian refugees have been registered in Germany, as of October 8, 2022\. Whilst housing is often not an issue, local councils are struggling with the educational and medical demands of incorporating people into the local school and healthcare systems\.

Centralised distribution of funding means that certain areas go significantly under\-funded, and in Cottbus, the mayor has accused the government of leaving them in the lurch: [_‚ÄúRich Germany can do everything, but that money is not spread around evenly_ \.‚Äù](https://www.dw.com/en/ukrainian-refugees-push-german-cities-to-their-limits/a-63582661?fbclid=IwAR2BR8JQQrAIzvMpBw_qYkDssoW5g8GQ0NXpHimG661DioKTJpobc38ctr4)

#### AUSTRIA

![](assets/9b06c8812614/1*IG-2Y2xhwoKweI6MVglVTA.png)


Austria‚Äôs role in border externalisation policies has been documented in [this publication](https://www.transform-network.net/fileadmin/user_upload/epaper_at_the_heart_of_fortress_europe_final.pdf) , which notes:


> In 2021, a parliamentary request for information specifically focussed on Austria‚Äôs plans to return people to the states of the Western Balkans, while another asked specific questions about the role of BiH\. One line of argument used by the interior minister in these documents is to strengthen the fact that Austria is ‚Äòonly‚Äô providing good practice, expertise and training, while the country concerned voices specific needs and is, in the end, responsible for ensuring that the human rights of those concerned will be upheld\. This is a common rhetorical practice in the context of EU border externalisation policies, with EU countries only providing knowledge and equipment, while ‚Äòaccession‚Äô countries in the Balkans have to fulfil the dark side of Europeanisation\.

German authorities have criticised Switzerland for allowing migrants to transit to neighbouring countries instead of sending them back to the first safe country of arrival as demanded by European accords\.

A spokesperson for the German government has said that ‚ÄúSwitzerland must fulfil its obligations as a member of the Schengen area and take action against illegal migration‚Äù\.

Founded in 1981, the Princess of Asturias Awards aim to foster [‚Äúscientific, cultural and humanistic values that form part of the universal heritage of humanity\.‚Äù](https://www.fpa.es/en/princess-of-asturias-awards/)

The first ever Refugee Olympic Team \(ROT\) was founded in 2015, and at Tokyo 2020 the team comprised of 29 athletes competing in 12 sports\. The ROT will also compete at Paris 2024, and the Olympic Refuge Foundation continues to run 13 programmes globally \(in Congo, Jordan, Kenya, Mexico, Rwanda, Turkey and Uganda\) that aim to improve well\-being and social inclusion for refugee populations\.

IOC President, Thomas Bach, said on receiving the award that:


> ‚Äúthis is why the IOC created the Refugee Olympic Team\. These athletes had no flag, no anthem and no home anymore\.‚Äù

- In January 2014, 11 people died off the island of Farmakonisi while being towed by the Greek Coastguard\. The survivors complain, but little happens\.
