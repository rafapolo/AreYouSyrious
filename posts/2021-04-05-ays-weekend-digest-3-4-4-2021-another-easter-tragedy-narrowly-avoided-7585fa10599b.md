#### FEATURED: Another Easter tragedy narrowly avoided

Of the 270 people in 3 boats we reported as in distress in the Maltese SAR zone [in Friday’s digest](ays-daily-digest-02-04-2021-europe-dont-let-there-be-another-easter-tragedy-c7ee666a26cc) , 2 boats, carrying 60 and 110 people, were rescued by Italian Authorities and taken to Lampedusa\. However, the fate of the remaining boat carrying 100 people is less clear\.

Yesterday the #NordicStar was instructed to move away after the arrival of a Maltese patrol boat but there is no news of any people disembarked in Malta. https://t.co/ECSATJOGTF

Again the pressure of the civil society was needed to push states to do their duty. https://t.co/clJt3i8MIx

Local NGOs are accusing the [Maltese Government of criminal behaviour](https://twitter.com/seawatch_intl/status/1378424191381352448) as they purposefully refused to intervene, once again putting people’s lives at risk\.

SEA
#### **Alan Kurdi court case**

[Sea\-eye report that](https://sea-eye.org/en/systematic-attacks-on-sea-rescuers-continue/?fbclid=IwAR0HbWxcus5vLnEF4k0u2Y6as1zbL_ii0-q6R3aNhMJzNj-2S4Hk3WZzvLE) , on April 7, 2021, the court hearing for the release of the rescue ship Alan Kurdi will take place in Cagliari, Sardinia\.


> The Italian coast guard had the ship detained on October 9, 2020 in Olbia, Sardinia, after it had rescued 133 people, including 62 minors, in three successful rescue operations\. 





GREECE
#### Updates from Kos

A coroner’s report confirmed that Macky Diabaté died of intestinal obstruction on Thursday in the detention centre \(PRO\.KE\.KA\) on Kos island\. [According to](https://www.efsyn.gr/node/288439) Greek media, Diabaté had previously undergone surgery on his abdomen, which created adhesions, resulting in his intestinal obstruction and his death in the early hours of Thursday\. As we reported, Diabaté had asked to be taken to an hospital many times in the previous days because of acute pain, but this never happened and he was given painkillers by the PRO\.KE\.KA staff\.

Despite appearing less in the news, conditions at Kos hotspots have not improved\. [According to](https://infocrisis.gov.gr/12765/apotyposi-tis-ethnikis-eikonas-katastasis-gia-to-prosfygiko-metanasteftiko-zitima-tin-01-04-2021/) government data, 106 people still live inside the camp\. A video from a tent in the camp shows a scorpion found near a family’s living space\.

#### Updates from Chios

A local activist [reports](https://twitter.com/Theurgia_Goetia/status/1378621776180224003) that on Saturday night, a person on the move was taken to the island’s hospital, after having been attacked and kicked by the passenger of a motorbike\.
#### Updates from Lesvos

Moria2\.0 workers complained that mass testing of camp’s residents has been [halted](https://www.politikalesvos.gr/choris-mazika-test-o-kara-tepe/?fbclid=IwAR1G6hBm6tiWV6VTd1NljBydG4Pv9az5GMGGydiHe2UvH4-ftAOfLDvFMBI) without notice, local media report\. A test facility had been operated by the WHO, but they left in March, following an agreement for which Greek National Public Health Organisation \(EODY\) would continue the mass testing of all residents\. According to local workers, who announced a protest, this never happened\.
#### Updates from Ritsona

> Viktoria has a new squatted social centre — Ζιζάνια\. May it be a neighbourhood space for self\-organisation, social interventions, collective resistance and community building\. 





> …We envision a space of interaction and exchange between people of different backgrounds, origins, identities and ages, who speak different languages and have different opinions\. These are conditions we must create and concretise together, through meeting each other, strengthening relationships inside and between our communities and connecting our struggles\. 





> … We have called ourselves Ζιζάνια because like weeds, we grow and flourish amidst the chaos, against all control, time and time again\. \( [Indymedia Athens](https://athens.indymedia.org//post/1611757/) \) 





The new space was taken on Saturday and [activities will take place throughout the week](https://www.facebook.com/ViktoriaSolidarity/photos/a.105437107900790/254228716354961/) :

Check out an article [HERE](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0042098021997009) on the important claims of the _right to the city_ raised by newly arrived people on the move in Athens\. “Although most refugees reside in overcrowded state\-run camps on the outskirts of the city, there are many cases in which refugees enact the production of collective common spaces, occupying abandoned buildings in the urban core and claiming the right to the centre of the city\.”
#### Updates from Fylakio in Evros

Researcher Lena K\. [reports](https://twitter.com/lk2015r/status/1378303519053205505) that the president of the Ainisio Delta association filed a legal complaint calling for the hotspot and detention centre to be closed as it doesn’t have a biological waste processing plant, so it pollutes nearby fields and ‘degrades the environment’\.

#### The Red Cross accused of ignoring medical requests at Las Raices, Tenerife\.

The Tenerife Migrant Support Assembly is [holding](https://twitter.com/AsambleaMigraTF/status/1378734795337961472/photo/1) a protest against the “criminal management of the Red Cross of the most vulnerable people: women and children\.”

[Reportedly](https://twitter.com/AsambleaMigraTF/status/1378734125197234177) , the activists had to take several children with fever to the hospital after the Red Cross workers refused to do so\.


> There are women in the red cross facility who are pregnant who are not being monitored for their delivery\. The red cross does not attend to them\. There are people with epilepsy and the red cross does not give them their medication\. [_\(source\)_](https://twitter.com/AsambleaMigraTF/status/1378734283708375041) 





People in Las Raices have been [protesting](https://twitter.com/AsambleaMigraTF/status/1378734621018439683) for weeks now against poor food, poor health care, lack of leisure activities and lack of schooling for children in the camp\.

#### **Corona cases in Miral camp**

At the Miral refugee camp in Velika Kladua, [135 people out of approximately 800](https://www.istraga.ba/u-kampu-miral-kod-velike-kladuse-virusom-korona-zarazeno-135-migranata/) have tested positive for the coronavirus\. [They are isolated in the camp, there are currently no serious cases](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FSrdjanGovedrica%2Fstatus%2F1378349665616330754%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2bMF854D1h203Bctq8sBF1qBMaUY1afJMONxy42Ju0ch2CK-rRhwz0cV0&h=AT3T-1K6jDunjUTECuodvRE1Vi2U0bfSP56oHgUUCXO3tr3Y-huzVi7DFbl5FGiSEsCFabENVS3JQ4XPBbQQndagMpDYnIByKzXNoSqKtpj9nD-SL2Si9aSqQdyB8TMbhw&__tn__=R]-R&c[0]=AT30gQ6vojGukBl8847Y07w3jHEzAA_2EcK9ve5zwNGfFi8aVUHnN8a5V1AIWKHhGYyW21RVIUkRten3-VDOre3iDmwBNfrXJO8P6IEWyVd0zqnL7zoQTnHIRSWIgK3ccky9qDXJlSZzABZKUXPcFH92m3we2oeqlYWaccsgfNXc4CB_aHUHLnYwTUafLI8Mhww-mtmFuPQ) , according to the immigration office in Sarajevo\.

[According to the IOM](https://bih.iom.int/sites/default/files/2021/Sitrep/IOM%20BiH%20External%20Sitrep_27%20March%202%20April_Final%20version_0.pdf) , which runs the camp, the situation is under control\. Those infected are under medical supervision, the camp staff are adequately equipped with protective clothing, the camp residents with protective masks\.

Humanitarian workers and activists have been warning for some time about terrible conditions in the camp and the risks this poses:


> It has been more than a year since this [\#pandemic](https://twitter.com/hashtag/pandemic?src=hashtag_click) is known\. We know that it kills people and we know that one of the best ways to avoid \[contagion\] is social distancing and hygiene\.

#### Glasgow: One year of hotel accommodation

April 3rd marked the anniversary of when asylum seekers were first moved from flats to hotels in the city\. Almost 400 people still live in budget hotel rooms managed by the Home Office contractor Mears — and living on just over £1 per day — despite concerns about the “devastating” impact of “institutional” accommodation on their mental and physical health\. Read more [HERE](https://theferret.scot/hundreds-of-asylum-seekers-still-housed-in-hotels/) \.
#### **“New power to deport rough sleepers may discriminate”**

A government Equality Impact Assessment, [released](https://libertyinvestigates.org.uk/articles/new-power-to-deport-rough-sleepers-may-discriminate-home-office-admits-in-new-doc/) by the campaigners of Liberty Investigates, recognises that homeless people with disabilities “may experience greater disadvantage” if deported to countries with poor access to support services\.


> Disability affects a large section of the UK’s homeless population, with Scottish figures showing more than half those seeking help for homelessness were also in need of support for conditions such as mental health issues, substance dependencies and learning disabilities\.
