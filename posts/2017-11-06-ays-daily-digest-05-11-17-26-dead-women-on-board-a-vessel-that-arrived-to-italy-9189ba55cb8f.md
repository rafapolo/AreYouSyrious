The Spanish ship Cantabria helped bring to shore more than 400 refugees who were on a vessel heading to Cantabria\. Among them were the bodies of 26 women who had died along the way\. 23 of them were on one boat and the other 3 on another one\. The victims [might have drowned](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ansa.it%2Fcampania%2Fnotizie%2F2017%2F11%2F05%2Fmigranti-sbarca-nave-a-salerno-a-bordo-26-donne-morte_ec02744f-44fd-49cb-a560-8a0817c85c93.html&h=ATNrYgSpW6wdfdxfNmmQo6AVEgFMOKV-3z9yaZxWPmriV0Vd1AWM1a0feSgQCJlnmAMWeCGhJinqMwbn1WLMixnLYgXAUm4NfvU4CJObVV9rRdknNieUu57lBx-nwttLO_IV1fSpZFMFmXUKeqZX51GIVal8y8UVUUgwpr5AQHCoAqznRyJr_ZU5qmX8ixLlXVsBv4qF32nVpw4tgsSplpw1YjLe5ONd8wPqk6_5PpunG558zcVnVDobRqvrWXf-SaywvORCxlse9w-YM8F6urWVWAEr) , but the authorities think its early to state this\. According to the prefect, the women are allegedly Nigerian, they were on board of the dinghies with some other men and ended up as victims of a drowning\.
The autopsy will reveal the cause of death and if they have been subject to violence\.

#### SYRIA

At least 75 people have been killed — many of them women and children — and 140 more have been injured in the car bomb attack perpetrated on Saturday by the Islamic State against displaced people in the Syrian region of Deir Ezzor, according to the report published by the [Syrian Observatory for Human Rights](http://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=77909) \.


> “The number of victims whose death has been confirmed so far by the OSDH has increased to 75, including dozens of children and women\.” 





In the province of Idlib the death of tens of children, young men and women have been reported due to the explosion of undetonated mines, shells and bombs\. These bombs are the remnants of the shelling of the regime and the military operation and the remnants of warplanes bombardment on areas in the province\.
#### TURKEY

Friday afternoon while travelling in a fishing boat south of the Dardanelles in western Turkey, the coast guard reported picking up a boat full of refugees\. The passengers included 110 Syrians, and the remaining 179 refugees were Pakistani, Afghan, Indian, Sri Lankan, Somali and Iranian nationals\. Seven Turkish and two Belarusian nationals who are thought to be migrant smugglers also were on board\.
#### GREECE
### Lesvos

### Athens

Mater Filia is a daycare centre for kids under 5\. They take babies and toddlers from 3 months old\. Their space is open from Monday\-Friday \(7 am\- 6pm\) \. Groups vary from about 15–20 kids\. Main languages are English and some Greek\. They require 5 euro contribution per day to help cover costs such as rent/food/snacks etc

If any families are looking for daycare whilst parents go out to work, please contact Mater Filia through their Facebook group\.

If there are any groups that can help Mater Filia with providing donations such as food/snacks for the kids or other items for activities, please get in touch with them directly through the Facebook group\. If you can help to cover their rent, that would be even better as they are providing a vital service for parents who need childcare\. It has no government funding\.
#### Support the families striking

The struggle of the 7 women and 7 men on hunger strike goes on despite the cold and the rain until they manage to reunite with their families\. For the refugees currently on a [hunger strike](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.euronews.com%2F2017%2F11%2F02%2Frefugees-go-on-hunger-strike-in-athens-asking-to-be-reunited-with-their-families&h=ATOpfhNWQbf15q0oCiU8HFXyNbqSIRvRCe7C-eP-tvq8AKImVVynH44AeNvREWFU2NbxaZyVR4Mlo051cflgHtHIJWtflpQgtErzqCqkW18EMgPwf8KoFzeAX1LKNEYDFYVrEJES7lDWPZbZNraonL19rUMzmsv996f_0xRg0t8nD97gS-Onsui10YU9TcZjqyGMJkHo8JzdHS91s5mxmltBrjFBkE8aBjOEB98vFyAxvYVnTwxLbh13U3PyePU4Qa3iUijQSaB7u0qUs7uC) , volunteers are asking for doctors who could offer advice and help during the strike\.

#### A large tent is needed for educational and social activities in Lavrio camp\.

“We are looking for a large tent to fit 40–50 people or of 15–20 metres for Lavrio 2 Refugee camp\. We are not allowed to build any structures here but we can put up a tent\. 
It’s 00:26 and I just returned from camp\. Winter is here and it is really really cold\. 
All the containers are too small for activities for a big number of people & also one container is a family home\. We’ve been doing movie nights and children’s activities outside\. Ad hoc educations sessions are also held outside\. Tonight we had to take movie night into a container due to the weather and it meant only a handful of people could participate\. It really is cold and it rained\!

People are constrained to their small containers and can’t even interact with each other leading to increasing isolation which was already a problem as Lavrio 2 is so far away from Athens with poor transportation\. We all know what the effects of low morale can be on people already effected by war and conflict in their home countries and on a journey for refuge\.”

“The increased police presence in Dunkirk has brought with it much anxiety, uncertainty and even a restriction of certain key items\.
