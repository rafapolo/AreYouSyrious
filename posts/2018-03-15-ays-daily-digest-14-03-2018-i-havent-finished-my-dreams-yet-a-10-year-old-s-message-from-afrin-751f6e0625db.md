### With Stephen Hawking’s passing, along with his legacy of incredible achievements, let us remember his message urging humanity to end the war in Syria\.


> “We must work together to end this war and to protect the children of Syria\.” — Stephen Hawking 




**Over the last months the war in Syria has escalated in the regions of Ghouta, Idlib and Afrin, and children continue to be most affected by these atrocities\.** Since this message below was written by Stephen Hawking in 2014, the situation in Syria continues to be much the same, and his plea remains just as relevant today\.


> The international community has watched from the sidelines for three years as this conflict rages, engulfing all hope\. As a father and grandfather, I watch the suffering of Syria’s children and must now say: No more” 





> I often wonder what we must look like to other beings watching from deep space\. As we look out at the universe, we are looking back in time, because light leaving distant objects reaches us much, much later\. What does the light emitting from Earth today show? When people see our past, will we be proud of what they are shown — how we, as brothers, treat each other? How we allow our brothers to treat our children? 





> We now know that Aristotle was wrong: the universe has not existed for ever\. It began about 14bn years ago\. But he was right that great disasters represent major steps backward for civilisation\. The war in Syria may not represent the end of humanity, but every injustice committed is a chip in the facade of what holds us together\. The universal principle of justice may not be rooted in physics but it is no less fundamental to our existence\. For without it, before long, human beings will surely cease to exist\.” — **Stephen Hawking**

**In commemoration of Stephen Hawking’s passing, and in conjunction with the advancement of the Turkish army in Afrin over the last days, we would like to share with you a short poem\.**

**This poem was co\-written by a ten year old Syrian\-Kurdish boy currently in Afrin in the care of a foster family, and a refugee turned dedicated humanitarian from Afrin, Nour Abo Sipan\.**

With Internet connection very difficult to obtain in the besieged region, the civilians in Afrin are struggling to get their messages out to the world\. Here is one message for you to read\.


> **Lament of a Syrian Kurdish boy in Afrin** 





> Why did you burn my dreams? 
 

> I haven’t finished my dreams yet… 
 

> I haven’t finished playing with my toys, 
 

> I haven’t finished playing with my childhood yet\. 
 

> My wishes were many\. 
 

> My wish was to grow up like all children\. 
 

> My wish was to study and to become a doctor\. 
 

> So why? 
 

> Why did you bring your wars to us? 
 

> and made my home a home for ghost, 
 

> and made our tears fall everywhere, 
 

> and our destination unclear, 
 

> and made us lose our home, 
 

> Why did you make us become refugees without a home? 
 

> Their evil hands prevented our hopes from being achieved, 
 

> and they burned tears on our eyes\.
 

>  I’m a ten year old child, my hair has turned white\. 
 

> I’m young, but my sorrow is huge\. 
 

> They killed my Dad and detained my brother\. 
 

> They made my mother homeless\. 
 

> I became the father of my own childhood 
 

> I became homeless, nameless, fatherless\.
 

> I’m a child, but a son of a martyr\. 
 

> Oh my mother I’m too tired of being far away without you\. 
 

> I miss sleeping in your lap, 
 

> I miss the smell of your bread… 
 

> Mother I miss my name\. 
 

> I don’t want to be called a refugee\. 
 

> Come on mom, enough crying\. 
 

> Enough enough enough\. 
 

> Oh mom, I can’t bear it anymore\. 
 

> I want to go back home, 
 

> I want to go back to my childhood and play with my toys\. 
 

> Mom, wake me up and say it’s a dream…a nightmare\. 
 

> Say my Dad isn’t dead, 
 

> Say my home is waiting for me, 
 

> Say my school is waiting for me\. 
 

> Please mom, say it\! 
 

> Because I can’t bear it anymore, 
 

> I can’t bear being far away without you, 
 

> and my father,
 

> and my home\. 
 

> I can’t bare it anymore\. 
 

> Please stop killing my childhood\.
 

> Please stop the war\! 




#### General

[The Missing Migrants Project has been collecting data on the deaths of refugee women since 2014](http://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/8063/lack-of-data-makes-migrant-women-s-deaths-invisible-iom) , however only one third of incidents that are recorded have any information related to the sex of those dead or missing\. This is leading to the death of women becoming ‘invisible’ according to IOM\.


> It is critical to seek better information on all those who go missing during migration so that we can understand why these people risked their lives and how these deaths could have been avoided\. — Helke Director of IOM’s Department of International Cooperation and Partnerships\.

The Saadnayel Community centre in the Bekaa Valley is providing much need psychological support to Syrian Refugees\.

#### Turkey
### Greek MEPs call for the release of the two Greek soldiers detained in Turkey

[Fifteen Greek Members of Parliament have released a joint statement](http://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2018/03/14/greek-soldiers-meps/) calling on the Turkish Government to promptly released the two Greek soldiers who are currently being detained in Edirne\. They were detained after they accidentally crossed into Turkish territory during a border patrol 2 weeks ago\.

#### The EU
### The EU to give Turkey 3 billion dollars for Syrian refugees in Turkey

Right before the second year anniversary of the EU\-TURKEY agreement, [the EU commission has announced](http://www.ekathimerini.com/226733/article/ekathimerini/news/eu-presses-tough-migration-stance-with-more-turkey-money-stricter-visa-rules) that it will give Turkey a further 3 billion dollars to use toward the improvement of conditions for Syrian refugees in the country\. [This is occurring despite concerns relating to the Turkish Regime\.](https://euobserver.com/migration/141322)

The EU has also vowed to restrict travel from the African countries who refuse to take back citizens whose asylum claims have been unsuccessful\.

These are both attempts to deter refugees from coming to Europe seeking protection\.
#### Greece
### Arrivals on Greek Islands: over 500 in 4 days

Despite arrivals having eased in the last two weeks, [earlier this week saw another spike](http://www.ekathimerini.com/226711/article/ekathimerini/news/more-than-500-migrants-reach-islands-in-four-days) , once again putting more pressure on the overcrowded facilities in the islands, especially in the Moria camp on Lesvos\. \#OpenTheIslands

### Riots in Moria

\* \* \* Breaking News\* \* \* 
We have received news from the ground that 180 people arrived on Lesvos this morning and that Moria camp is currently in lock down\. We will follow this story throughout the day\. Further information will be available in tomorrows digest\.

Riots have broken out once again in Moria following the near death of a young Syrian man who was denied asylum and forced to remain in Moria while the rest of his family was granted it\. He was electrocuted as he climbed up an electric pillar in protest against this abhorrent decision\. He survived but obtained serious and life threatening injuries, and is currently in Mytilini hospital\.


> **Statements from volunteer groups on ground:** 
 

> This follows recent and continuing suicide attempts, which have become a daily reality in the Greek islands\. All around people are desperate and depressed: they don’t know what is next, why they can’t move on to the mainland, why they don’t get a decision, why they are treated like they are\. — Lesvos Solidarity — Pipka 





> Moria right now\. People protesting after a boy almost killed himself yesterday because he was sick of the conditions, sick of waiting\.The two year anniversary of the EU Turkey deal is upon us in a few days\. Nothing has changed\. If anything the situation is worse\. — Refucomm 





[efsyn\.gr reported](http://www.efsyn.gr/arthro/fotia-kai-epeisodia-ston-kataylismo-tis-morias) that the protest started at 7\.30pm and finished at 10pm\. They state the situation was very out of control and that there were women and children yelling and crying who were trapped there\. They also report of prosecutions and arrests\. In the morning it is suspected that two more young refugees also tried to commit suicide via the electrical pole\.

MSF reports to have treated 6 people severely affected by tear gas during the protest, 3 babies among them\.

### Unaccompanied Minors are at Risk in Greece


> The ongoing border regime and lack of proper safety allows unaccompanied minors to live on the street\.

The reality for some unaccompanied minors is that they don’t even have a safe place to sleep\.

### Lampedusa hotspot closed and evacuated for restructuring

The hotspot on the small Italian island of Lampedusa is know for fires, illegal detention, scabies, lack of protection for women and children and degrading conditions\. Many groups working on the ground [are urging that a restructuring is not enough,](http://agrigento.gds.it/2018/03/14/chiusura-dellhotspot-di-lampedusa-il-garante-cambio-di-passo-nella-tutela-dei-diritti-dei-migranti_817576/) and that human rights must be followed if it is to be re\-opened\. The hotspot is intended for short stays for initial processing but [many people seeking asylum have been forced to remain there for extensive periods of time\.](https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/03/14/italy-shuts-down-worrying-migrant-hotspot)


> The actions to be carried out in the hotspot of Lampedusa “should not be confined to mere material restructuring, which is absolutely necessary and has been repeatedly requested\. Groups urge that upon re\-opening, foreign nationals housed within the structure must remain there for a maximum of 48 hours\. — Mediterranean Hope 





> Lampedusa’s hotspot has been “temporarily” emptied, but its momentary closure appears more like a way to erase the evidence of the crime\. That’s why it must remain permanently closed\. — Melting Pot Europa

### Syrian man falsely accused of ‘terrorism’ ahead of Hungarian elections — ‘A travesty of justice’


[![Europe's Out of Control](assets/751f6e0625db/0605_hqdefault.jpg "Europe's Out of Control")](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UweFfo6Sgqs)


Ahmed H \(49\) on September 16, 2015, was trying to calm a very intense situation during a protest where hundreds of refugees attempted to penetrate a barbed wire fence on the Serbo\-Hungarian border\. He was arrested and charged with terrorism and has been on trial for 2 and a half years\. He has now been sentenced to 7 years in prison “for illegal border crossings and participation in a terrorist act during clashes with police”

This all happened ahead of Hungary’s elections, once again creating media attention around the common belief that is portrayed by many politicians, that refugees are terrorists\. This is a strategic attempt to ignite fear in the public and to criminalise people seeking security\. The sentencing of Ahmed is a travesty of justice\.

Many human rights groups are protesting the sentencing of Ahmed [including Amnesty International\.](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/03/hungary-syrian-mans-conviction-for-alleged-complicity-in-an-act-of-terror-is-travesty-of-justice/)

> Today our first group of volunteers from A drop in the Ocean are traveling to Paris to assist the many hundred people living in provisional camps in the city\. Many of these are refugees who have received rejection on their application for protection in other countries\. By going back to the home country, which too many is a country they don’t know, they risk persecution and oppression, or at worst their life\. For the first few weeks, our people are going to brief themselves to see where we can best be useful\. We have received amazing good response from people who are already running relief efforts in Paris and who welcome us\. There are also many who eventually want to contribute as volunteers, as soon as there will be established regular tasks\. 




#### Germany
### Migration to Germany fell by 50% in 2016 compared to 2015

[According to a report released by Info Migrants,](http://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/8057/net-migration-to-germany-sank-by-half-in-2016-statistics-office) net migration in Germany fell by more than half from the year 2015 \(at the height of the crisis\) to 2016\. This report was made following information released by the German Federal Statistics Office\.


> Altogether 1,865,000 people came to Germany in 2016, while 1,365,000 left, which equals a net migration figure of 500,000\. That is down from 1,140,000 the year before, at the height of [the refugee crisis\.](http://www.dw.com/en/fewer-migrants-enter-europe-via-the-mediterranean-sea-says-un-agency/a-42800544)

### Housing of refugees awaiting asylum claims describes as ‘a disgrace’

In the UK close to 40,000 people who are housed by the home office [are living in conditions that have been called a disgrace](https://www.hja.net/no-choices-no-hope-homes-asylum-seekers-described-disgrace/) while they wait for their asylum claims to be decided\.


> In 2017 the House of Commons home affairs select committee carried out their own inquiry into housing for Asylum seekers\. They reached the conclusion that “the current contract system for asylum accommodation isn’t working and major reforms are needed\. The Committee brands the state of some asylum accommodation provided by Government contractors a “disgrace” and says it is “shameful” that very vulnerable people have been placed in these conditions”\.
