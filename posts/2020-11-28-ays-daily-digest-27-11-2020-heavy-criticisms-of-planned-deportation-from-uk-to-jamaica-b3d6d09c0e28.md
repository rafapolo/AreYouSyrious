UK
#### Black Public Figures, Activists Speak Out Against Next Week’s Deportation to Jamaica

On December 2nd, the UK Home Office plans to deport 50 people back to Jamaica despite widespread outcry\. People have pointed out the dangerous conditions that await potential returnees in Jamaica, as well as several cases of people that have been deported unjustly in the past\. At least one man who was deported in February during the last round of deportations to Jamaica was actually the grandson of a member of the Windrush generation and as such had the right to remain in the UK\.

Black public figures from Bernardine Evaristo to Naomi Campbell [signed a letter](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/nov/27/black-public-figures-urge-airlines-not-to-carry-out-home-office-deportation?fbclid=IwAR1ueD1CWikTWDgwjc5LWOW63Iel4IhMg7uB-LHQUSpM2axMTzABfH98wDs) urging airlines not to cooperate with the planned deportation\. It is not sure which airline will be used for the deportation, although activists speculate that it [might be TUI](https://twitter.com/calaisolidarity/status/1332075608503939072?fbclid=IwAR2Dcd3PPaqQ2M3yzkJ2jXCxFaPyaQNiWHSD6Qteots1VZm2JjhF8NzOEL4) since it is the Home Office’s \#1 deportation flight partner\. One of the major British airlines, Virgin Airlines, stopped cooperating with British deportation flights in 2018 after the Windrush scandal\. The signees also pointed to the recent [resignation of Alexandra Ankrah](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/nov/18/black-official-quit-allegedly-racist-windrush-compensation-scheme) , the most senior Black civil servant involved in the Windrush scheme, over the racism within the organization, as proof that the Home Office is unable to competently handle the current deportations\. Of course, the Home Office responded by calling all the people they plan to deport “dangerous foreign criminals\.”

Activists criticized the deportations, which are being arranged under dubious circumstances that don’t follow the people’s basic rights\. Some of the people have not been [allowed to contact family](https://twitter.com/WindrushLives/status/1331723176771022856?fbclid=IwAR3IlWrJ8ylocELocpBRHrc9QQt0koxqcAPAJMAhlY5CtrG4PPJ7MHYCT5A) on the ground in Jamaica due to obscure legal meddling\. The people are [held in conditions](https://twitter.com/BARACUK/status/1331654984862208000) with no social distancing or COVID precautions and are suffering from mental health problems — one man tried to take his own life\. They also pointed to the Home Office’s past violations of due process \(and basic morality\) through practices such as illegally entering people’s homes for the purpose of immigration enforcement\.

The Home Office [released a fact sheet](https://twitter.com/WindrushLives/status/1332402849502859266) about the planned deportation, but in a bizarre twist it was not published on any official government website but released on Scribd, raising suspicions about why a document of clear public interest would not be released as widely as possible\.

The Home Office has come under fire for many of its other recent actions\. It is [reviving the hostile environment](https://bylinetimes.com/2020/11/26/beyond-bullying-home-office-renews-hostile-environment-for-asylum-seekers/?fbclid=IwAR3MS-Xelpkvf711o5rApzSI5vcM8siaOSh_rKXyzI7l0sskCWinZygltts) in full force, despite opposition from local councils and NGOs such as The Institute of Race Relations which [launched a Twitter storm](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20201127-twitter-storm-calls-for-safe-passage-to-europe-for-refugees/?fbclid=IwAR0k6eK3__oa6lJql_7Te0lskcxFsfF9uj4llUhqaOdIj-eKZJv-p3dEluw) calling for Safe Passage Now\. Local councils are angry at the Home Office for not negotiating, conducting health screenings or providing financial assistance for people housed in their jurisdiction and creating cramped conditions where at least 122 asylum seekers caught COVID\-19 in hotels nationwide\.

These deportations cannot happen\! The people’s basic rights have been violated, many have not been granted due process, and it is dangerous to cram them into a plane during a pandemic\. If you are based in the UK, No Borders MCR wants you to sign a letter to your MP [here](https://twitter.com/nobordersmcr/status/1332028046711402503?fbclid=IwAR1ZLA7dxxXRsfA8FDpjX6Clq-g95Z8zyzZG5Sc9yxIYsy3gR9LdbRGClRs) \.
#### SEA
#### 132 Deaths in the Central Mediterranean This Month

AlarmPhone’s monthly report showed that [132 people drowned](https://thecivilfleet.wordpress.com/2020/11/26/132-deaths-in-reported-in-the-central-mediterranean-since-november-1/?fbclid=IwAR3NV1bJNFjnDekl4ejHKZW57_o7mXHRXThdBwNhNNqbf3PP96qBfWLEM-Y) in the Mediterranean in the month of November\. Many of those deaths could have been prevented if governments responded to AlarmPhone’s calls for distress instead of ignoring them\. How many others have died that we do not know of?


> “It is not the sea that is killing people: it is Europe and those who want to keep it a fortress\.” 



#### GREECE
#### More Closed Centres in the Aegean

The Greek government has continued its practice of closing all open centres and alternative housing in favor of closed centres, a practice many have said is a racist detention policy\. The latest casualty is the [Open Temporary Reception Structure on Lero](https://twitter.com/Refugees_Gr/status/1332432076751060993) s—the last 22 residents have been transferred to the closed centre on the island\.

The basic needs of people on the move in Greece are not being met—including their right to a dignified burial\. The [lack of Muslim cemeteries](https://greece.greekreporter.com/2020/11/27/muslims-decry-lack-of-appropriate-burial-places-in-greece/?fbclid=IwAR00cCkPX4CilzfceRNpaYRHBtpKc4cdwMMxvt2nLwfQ2g_DC1Axy-WyLgQ) in Greece means that many people are unable to bury their dead following religious practices\.
#### BALKANS
#### What Will the New Pact on Migration Mean for the Balkans?

In an [interview with _Novosti_](https://www.portalnovosti.com/emina-buzinkic-hrvatska-ce-postati-probirnica?fbclid=IwAR1MunIU-FFw9WARLKYwsIQrh-tAw1SdrXkhkngkLxPkbTn8rTMqu-g9eYE) , Emina Bužinkić from Transbalkanska Soldarnost explained how the EU’s New Pact will affect the Balkans, Croatia in particular\. Due to the pact’s reliance on border states to conduct asylum pre\-screenings, Croatia will become both a trap for people on the move and a graveyard\.

The past four years have seen an escalation of violent acts committed by the Croatian police, such as [this brutal beating](https://twitter.com/NoNameKitchen1/status/1332365686883180549?fbclid=IwAR2d0V-9dJQY633c6CECm45zBF4Pe3D9MvhkafNl3gxM8n_Q7G-ZEoA57v0) and pushback of an Afghan woman in front of her son only a few days ago\. The Croatian border police’s violence will only increase as the role of border countries within the EU migration system increases in importance\.

Pushbacks from Croatia affect the situation for people on the move and locals in its neighbouring countries\. In Bosnia & Herzegovina, people are setting up makeshift shelters [in abandoned homes](https://twitter.com/jogiralt/status/1332423190191222789?fbclid=IwAR0I2kX1WIYVZazRZzVrSR1HxD_roq6qLdBYtQ_xGRJiuXBc3uFJBh3bNKE) because they cannot seek asylum in Croatia\. For more about the situation for people along the Balkan route, check out [this documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RswAhpyrvmE&fbclid=IwAR1ujPSjzkjubQxEqQVzPEsimncrZmpeDdg_kDaZ9fd9LaIFNUGilRJQ_vc) called “Ahmed’s diary,” following a young man who has been pushed back from the Croatian border four times\.

The EU’s New Pact on Migration will only increase the problems of pushbacks, violence and death along the Balkan route, especially at the borders of Croatia as Croatian border police are tasked more explicitly with the agenda to guard Europe’s borders\. Its repercussions will also reach far beyond the borders of the EU, into countries that have been denied accession\.
#### MALTA
#### Practice of Detention in Malta Criticized

In an [op\-ed published by ECRE](https://www.ecre.org/op-ed-detention-in-malta-might-be-the-norm-but-it-is-no-solution/?fbclid=IwAR3bAiu6h4fjhyBlko5yAPWEVt_68bUhQ_pvntvrbIzMnNC2sbykJhMEThg') , Dr\. Neil Falzon criticized the Maltese government’s practice of detaining people on the move in squalid conditions\. People have been detained in Lyster and Safi Barracks since the summer of 2018 under the suspicion of spreading disease and deprived of their legal rights, including documents\.


> Malta’s detention centres are packed with desperate men living in conditions so appalling that no adjectives can come close to describing them\. Every week we are faced with accounts of suicide attempts, self\-harm, bullying and harassment\. When these experiences are recounted by hopeless children who are too scared to sleep at night, our strength falters and, for a brief moment, we lose our composure\. 




#### SPAIN
#### Spanish Navy Responds to Vox, Cites “Legal and Moral” Obligation to Rescue

The Admiral General of the Spanish Navy, Teodoro Lopez Calderon, responded to the far\-right party Vox’s call to [form a naval blockade](https://www.europapress.es/nacional/noticia-armada-responde-vox-obligacion-legal-moral-seria-rescate-migrantes-mar-20201125155318.html?fbclid=IwAR0m7XEtn8VuoES3GNkvk3YVtZ7PtUnWlPnMWmHAe-fzUXcyBH-whfjOc44) around the Canary Islands to prevent people on the move from reaching the archipelago\. Calderon said that there would be no such thing because the Spanish Navy has a “legal and moral” [obligation to rescue people](https://www.facebook.com/MAYDAYTERRANEO/posts/809452002937223) in distress at sea, not prevent them from reaching their destination\.

Calderon also dismissed Vox’s allegations that people in small boats were being launched from “mother ships” a few kilometers off the Spanish shore as claims with no evidence\.
#### EU
#### Religious Leaders Warn of Dangers to Europe’s Soul

High\-ranking representatives of various religious leaders [criticized the European Commission](https://www.welt.de/regionales/bayern/article221209332/Bedford-Strohm-Europa-verliert-seine-Seele-im-Mittelmeer.html?fbclid=IwAR13KtjFYZO1NviUQoSbtyMfnPDTN74rTIG8cLe5xkyRLBPDLWbYRtTvGKI) for not solving the problem of deaths in the Mediterranean\. Heinrich Bedford\-Strohm, Chairman of Germany’s Council of the Evangelical Church, said “Europe will lose its soul if we continue to watch people drown there\.”

It is highly unlikely that deaths will stop or lessen after the new Pact is enacted\. Many observers have pointed out that the new Pact on Migration does [nothing to address pushbacks](https://www.asileproject.eu/setting-the-right-priorities-is-the-new-pact-on-migration-and-asylum-addressing-the-issue-of-pushbacks-at-eu-external-borders/?fbclid=IwAR0Tj7XMz72A2SS3zonJyGbBwOXfERn_5Sqc4XwIBASCETRDM9GmO_m0tIw) at the EU’s external borders, which are often deadly\.
