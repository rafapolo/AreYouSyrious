Abd al\-Rahman al\-Milad, known as Bija, infamous human trafficker was arrested on Wednesday
### Human Trafficker Bija was arrested

On Wednesday, Libyan officials arrested Abd al\-Rahman al\-Milad, known as Bija, due to a mandate from the Interior Minister Bashaga\. Bija _‚Äúis considered by the UN and the International Court of The Hague as one of the major organizers of the smuggling of migrants, first enslaved in Libya and then herded on dilapidated boats to make them cross the central Mediterranean\.‚Äù_ He has also been accused of drowning people along the crossing\. Italian outlet [La Stampa](https://www.lastampa.it/cronaca/2020/10/14/news/il-trafficante-di-esseri-umani-bija-arrestato-in-libia-1.39417029) reports:


> ‚ÄúFor this reason, he is accused of human rights crimes but until now he had continued, unabated, to carry out his lucrative and unscrupulous activity, at first even as an officer of one of the local sections of the so\-called Libyan Coast Guard\. The trafficker, according to the UN, who sought his arrest, for years has been able to manage and decide the life, and even death, of thousands of migrants detained in the terrible Libyan connection houses, especially in the Zawiya area, to the west\. Tripoli, one of the main Libyan ‚Äòports‚Äô from which migrants depart\.‚Äù 





[Nancy Porsia](https://twitter.com/nancyporsia/status/1316431345615339520) a freelance journalist, who has [received threats](https://twitter.com/nancyporsia/status/1316390989112762376) from Bija, reported on the backlash from Bija‚Äôs supporters after the arrest:


> ‚ÄúAfter Bidja‚Äôs arrest this afternoon, Zawiya‚Äôs militias are already in Tripoli\. Armed clashes in the capital\. Shortly before, on the FB account of the Coast Guard of Zawiya, a greeting to the captain appeared ‚Äòpride‚Äô as they define him ‚Ä¶‚Äù 





This is a developing story and AYS will continue to cover it\.

#### ITALY

Asylum seekers who have been in Italy for years and are living in various housing structures are being tested for COVID\. The catch is that many who have tested positive are being moved to quarantine upon ships with new arrivals\. [Info Migrants](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/27902/deprived-of-their-liberty-long-term-asylum-seekers-in-italy-who-test-positive-for-covid-19-sent-to-quarantine-ships?fbclid=IwAR2KyXKNzBl6StPsOsbTEBN0Rg-a_Ms31uxiV1KrjMzDd0XcqOFs3DDPuEg) talked with ARCI \(Associazione Ricreativa Culturale Italiana\) which expressed ‚Äúprofound worries‚Äù and ‚Äúcondemnation‚Äù of this new practice of Italy‚Äôs COVID response:


> ‚ÄúSince the fight against the coronavirus has seen the implementation of numerous restrictive measures for citizens around the world, Italy has been routinely quarantining newly arrived migrants on board ferries moored off shore in several ports in the south of the country\. According to ARCI, there are currently five in operation, but the numbers of those on board have not been officially released\. 





> Now, it appears that some of the migrants and asylum seekers being sent there are in fact not newly arrived but have been resident in various reception centers for several months or even years\. Many of them are waiting for responses to their asylum claims and, as ARCI points out, have a right to a place in the reception system\.‚Äù 





On Monday, Milan public prosecutor Paolo Storari closed the investigation into Uber Italy‚Äôs exploitation of workers, many of whom were asylum seekers and migrants\. Uber Italy Manager Gloria Bresciani has been charged as well as others\. This is a developing story, but in regards to their treatment of employees, [Info Migrants](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/27910/inquiry-into-uber-italy-exploitation-declared-closed?fbclid=IwAR3ykcqae19OkT02UsRHjLdEb9kqKK7vX_weYw_b5JoeiTc0dxOWZkwIKrI) reports:


> ‚ÄúAccording to official documents, they exploited the ‚Äòstate of need‚Äô of ‚Äòasylum seeking migrants‚Äô who were living in migrant reception centers and who were from ‚Äòconflict areas \(Mali, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Gambia, Guinea, Pakistan, Bangladesh\) and thus in a condition of extreme vulnerability and social isolation\.‚Äô 





> The workers, the documents stated, ‚Äòwere paid ‚Ç¨3 per delivery, regardless of the distance travelled,‚Äô the weather or the time of the day or night that they worked\. They were also allegedly ‚Äòrobbed‚Äô of tips that customers left voluntarily and ‚Äòpunished‚Äô via arbitrary cuts to the agreed wages when they did not abide by all instructions\.‚Äù

They say that Spain violated the Convention on the Rights of the Child, particularly its ‚Äúright to identity, the right to be heard, and the right to special protection of children deprived of their family environment\.‚Äù


> ‚ÄúAccording to the experts, in the fourteen cases analyzed by the Committee, Spain did not carry out the appropriate procedure to determine the age of the young people\. Based on a publication by the UN Refugee Agency \(UNHCR\), the X\-ray used in Spain to determine age has a margin of error of four years\. According to the figures provided by UNHCR, during the first nine months of 2019 some 2,500 children arrived in Spain, many of them unaccompanied\. For this reason, the Committee highlights ‚Äòthe fundamental importance of determining the age of any individual who claims to be a minor, given that the result of said determination will determine whether they have the right to protection as children\.‚Äô 





> The president of the Committee, Luis Pedernera, stressed that while the process of verifying the age of young people is pending resolution ‚Äòthe person must be presumed a minor and treated as such,‚Äô and that when they have identity documents ‚Äòthey must be considered valid unless there is evidence to the contrary, as recognized by the Supreme Court of Spain itself\.‚Äô‚Äù

Heinrich\-B√∂ll\-Stiftung published a report called ‚ÄúBrutality as the new normal‚Äù in which they interviewed a local from Vrnograƒç, a small village near the border with Croatia, about the violence some locals have been perpetrating against refugees\.

#### SERBIA

In an update from InfoPark:


> ‚ÄúThe parks and streets of Savamala in Belgrade continue to be occupied by many refugees and other migrants, with an average of 250 persons spotted by Info Park mobile teams in the afternoon hours this past week\. With the worsening weather conditions, refugees and migrants feel under pressure to continue moving irregularly, to avoid being stuck in Serbia during the winter\. There are many families among them with young children sleeping rough in Belgrade while waiting for the ‚Äûgame‚Äú\. In interviews with Info Park‚Äôs mobile team, some families say that they are refusing accommodation in asylum and reception centers because of their remoteness\. They also said that police patrols are regularly visiting the parks and squats where refugees and migrants sleep and ordering everyone to leave the site without much explanation\. For the first time since 2017, refugees and migrants are making makeshift accommodation in the middle of the parks of the Savamala area to protect themselves while sleeping rough\. Several Arab and Kurdish families from Syria and Iraq have reportedly tried to register at the police department for foreigners in Savska, but with no success\. According to them the police officers said there is no registration for the time being and a mandatory 14\-day\-isolation will be introduced for the refugees and migrants who wish to be registered\.‚Äù
