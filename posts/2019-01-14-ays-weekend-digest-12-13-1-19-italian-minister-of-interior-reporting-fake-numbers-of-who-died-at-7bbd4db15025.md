### Feature

Italy’s Interior Minister [Matteo Salvini](https://www.open.online/primo-piano/2019/01/11/news/fact_checking_quanti_migranti_sono_morti_in_mare_nel_2018_secondo_salvini-105238/) reported fake numbers of the people who died in the Central Mediterranean route in 2018\. He wanted to tell the story on television that the number of deaths have drastically decreased, when that is not the truth\.

UNHCR reports that 1276 people went missing or died in the Central Mediterranean in 2018, significantly higher than Salvini’s incomplete data of 23 people\.

Salvini is not glossing over details, **he is lying** \.

No one else should have to die at sea under this political agenda\.
### Syria

In Idlib, at least 11,000 internally displaced persons are at risk of freezing to death with temperatures dropping to \-1C with torrential rain and snow\. Tents and belongings have been swept away in floods and there are dire shortages of supplies to take care of basic needs\. More rain and snow is expected early this week\.

[Save the Children](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jan/12/real-risk-of-refugees-freezing-to-death-in-syria-after-rains-destroy-shelters?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other&fbclid=IwAR2nlmb-D-cnwquJ-ZIlhLmmckry9qfDzSHBymopMu0_vx7bf0PagxEbsec) reports of cases of babies freezing to death last year in similar conditions\. [Violence](https://www.unocha.org/story/syria%E2%80%99s-freshly-displaced-desperate-need-winter-supplies?fbclid=IwAR3irYMH35ZFLmrUtKMXUIEBw9C-wYRe_OjBo0cct2uxnQz69mhQgiKHOmI) in Idlib is also preventing aid from being distributed\.
### Lebanon

[For days](https://www.npr.org/2019/01/09/683528148/heavy-winter-storm-wrecks-syrian-refugee-camps-in-lebanon?fbclid=IwAR1o1gr2rui0iDow2L2UROmHUNB8lyGdSFf-4IYjaEcx7CIHpNTsRblz1kI) cold winter rain and snow from the storm \(named “Norma” by Lebanese meteorologists\) has made conditions in refugee camps unbearable\. 11,000 people are affected by the storm, and another 70,000 people’s temporary accommodations in informal settlements are at risk if the weather continues\. Emergency supplies to keep shelters intact and people dry are desperately needed\. Lebanon does not allow official refugee camps, but regardless of that 1,5 million Syrian refugees are residing in the country due to the war\. the vast majority of them live below the poverty line\.
### Libya

[UN Secretary\-General, Antonio Guterres](https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/1542766/guterres-says-deeply-concerned-over-widespread-violations-human-rights-libya) , expressed his deep concern about the human rights conditions in Libya, calling on Thursday for the Libyan government to protect detainees from torture and ensure fair trials\.


> “All prisons must be under the effective control of the government and not subject to any influence or interference from armed groups\.” 





His report notes how women and children are particularly vulnerable to rape and exploitation at the hands of the government\.

[6 bodies](https://twitter.com/AngiKappa/status/1084431406162497536) were found off the coast of Sirte\. 20 bodies have been found in total since the start of 2019 from Sirte beaches\.
### Sea

[54 people](https://twitter.com/HelenaMaleno/status/1084173148277358592?fbclid=IwAR0WWyQmcu1ys4YXzo2qXYG2PSjsaNigb3PwsnGRzbkHb8TaZkh1ZAZFNJo) are missing in the Aboran Sea in the Western Mediterranean\. [91 people](https://twitter.com/SRodrigoruiz/status/1084490307977314309?fbclid=IwAR1ZLEmLQi3ItWdfRgHQaNjDCr4B98Iw5DmmOY803z3HvVVCGq74A3KsZOw) have been rescued but one ship is still missing\.

Continuing their measures against humanitarian sea rescue, the Maltese government has rejected a request by sea rescuers to exchange 10 crew members for four new volunteers\. The government gave no reason for the denial\. NGO vessel _Professor Albrecht Penck_ has been barred from entering ports in Malta\.

They note that the increase in malpractice might be a sign of an upcoming mass\-intervention\. These have taken place every 3–6 months where police destroy and burn down squats and violently force people to transfer to camps\.

On Friday, two policemen and a proclaimed owner of an abandoned building already destroyed a part of the space where 20 people were living, injuring two men\. No Name Kitchen is trying their best to help these people in their need to make it through this winter\.

### France

[Refugee Infobus](https://www.facebook.com/RefugeeInfoBus/posts/2317033271865421?__tn__=-R) is looking fora volunteer — a French legal support worker in Calais for assisting refugees accessing legal information\. To apply please send a CV and cover letter to mail@refugeeinfobus\.com with your available starting date\.

[In Paris](https://www.ecre.org/france-lottery-based-access-to-migrants-day-centre-a-reminder-of-reception-shortages/?fbclid=IwAR1ZFhS7wQHqYGYYY04lMZal1OXRubi6GIjFr7QWOFkyIBUGk9nc8erYhNA) , the migrants’ day centre run by the organization France Horizon give accommodation to people according to a lottery system\. Every morning 150 to 400 people arrive at the center in the hope of getting one of the 50 spaces\. While perhaps more fair than a “first come, first served system,” which in the past has led to fights, this way is just a reminder of the crisis in a shortage of reception centers in France\. The French government plans to increase the number of reception centers by the end of 2019\.

[The police in Paris](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=2238867093106584&id=100009499466124) have started slashing tents with people in them in order to destroy the only shelter they have left\. [2,039 people](http://www.infomigrants.net/fr/post/14458/a-paris-plus-de-2-000-migrants-dorment-sur-les-trottoirs?fbclid=IwAR0hNRh17d5f6mtSBYVVnLTFbu5Pb3I8LSBosV81bXRbDz-BfTJdbk-EE_I) are forced to live in tents across the city, without access to proper shelter, announced on Wednesday by the association France Terre d’asile\. The government is promising that 1,200 places of shelter for migrants will open soon\.

### Denmark

Afghanistan Migrants Advice & Support Org has provided an update on the family of 4 deported from Denmark to Afghanistan in October 2018\. The government of Denmark ignored the mother’s claim that her life was in danger due to her father’s reproach at her marrying a man he didn’t approve of\. The family is thankfully out of Afghanistan once again and trying to reach safety by other means\.
