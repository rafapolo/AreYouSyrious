### Germany
#### Foreign Office spreads inaccurate information

On its “Rumours about Germany” homepage the Federal Foreign Office claims that they want to deliver “facts for migrants”\. However, the German newspaper “tageszeitung” \(taz\) [reports](https://taz.de/Aufklaerungskampagne-fuer-Migranten/!5478674/) , the office had to correct some information that were not accurate\.

In an earlier version the simple answer to the question “Are you going to be deported if you enter the country illegally?” was “Yes” which in fact is not true\. The “ [Netzwerk Flüchtlingsforschung](http://fluechtlingsforschung.net/werben-gegen-asyl/) ” \(Network Refugee Research\) made this public earlier this month\. The office justified the simple answer with an extended version, that said that people with a negative decision, who do not return voluntarily, will be deported\.

“Your nationality = Your right for asylum?” was another question with the answer: “No\. Only people, who have suffered from prosecution or serious damages, can hope for the right for asylum\.” The authors of Netzwerk Flüchtlingsforschung disproved this statement, too\. The reasonable fear for prosecution or serious damage could be a reason\.

Already after its launch last year, the webpage has been criticized for being inaccurate and giving misleading information\. Some say, that the intention is rather to frighten people and discourage them from leaving their countries, than to show them opportunities\.
#### Protests for the right to stay

Around 50 Iraqis have protested for the right to stay in Germany last weekend in Düsseldorf\. Across the district court they showed a play to highlight how peope are being kidnapped, beaten, arrested and killed in their country of origin, [report\-d](https://www.report-d.de/Duesseldorf/Aktuelles/Duesseldorf-Iraker-demonstrieren-fuer-ein-Bleiberecht-91182) writes\.

Because a deportation to Afghanistan is scheduled for tomorrow from Düsseldorf, solidarity groups call again for action\.

### Greece

A total number of 37\.597 refugees and asylum seekers in around 17\.000 households in 92 locations all over Greece received cash assistance, according to AYS info\. The eligibility for this assistance depends on various factors such as legal status, the current location and the date of entry into Greece\. Also, the amount of cash assistance disbursed to each houshold varies proportionally to the number of family members\.

The total range is between 90 Euros for an individual in an accomodation, where meals are included, to up to 550 Euros for a family of seven members or more in a self\-supplying accomodation\. 85% of the individuals in the cash assistance scheme are Syrian, Iraqi, Afghan, Palestinian or Iranian nationals\.

As the NGO providing the cash assistance has changed now a couple of times, this sometimes is connected with longer waiting times\. Eligible are only the ones who are recognized asylum seekers and have a formal address, which makes the program inaccessible for homeless people or the ones living in alternative accomodations like squats\. Further, only NGOs running their accomodation projects under the EKKA programme are allowed to refer their residents to the cash cassistance, but it does not happen automatically\. As sometimes people who live in official sites, are still not registered properly, the yalso do not have access to the program\.

People living in private shelters, can use this [online form](https://ee.humanitarianresponse.info/::Y0uN) to apply for the cash card\. It should be known that it expires after six months, although they might not get direct access to the Greek social system\. Still — if granted — it can be helpful in this time\.
#### Islands

For the second time, Syrian nationals have been returned from Greece to Turkey against their will under the EU\-Turkey deal\. A total of 22 people, 21 men and one women, were transferred by plane from Mytilene to Adana, the Greek Ministry of Citizen Protection [announced](http://www.mopocp.gov.gr/index.php?option=ozo_content&lang&perform=view&id=6300&Itemid=653) \. While eleven of them withdrew their asylum applications, seven had a negative decision in the second degree and four after a recall\.

The first deportation after a negative decision [was conducted](http://www.mopocp.gov.gr/index.php?option=ozo_content&lang=&perform=view&id=6265&Itemid=650) on 8th November, when four Syrians, two of them after they withdrew they applications, were returned from Greece to Turkey\. In the end of September 2017, the Greek Supreme Court [ruled](https://apnews.com/2293b9c8bffe4e06a3b57621f65bd833) that Syrians can be returned to Turkey under the deal signed in March 2016, as it would not be an unsafe country for them\. Since the deal came into force, more than 250 Syrians — most of them voluntarily due to the bad conditions on the Greek islands —\(were\) returned to Turkey under this scheme, making it the second biggest group after Pakistani \(more than 630\) \.

So far, 43 people have been returned to Turkey under the EU\-Turkey deal in 2018\. Depending on the sources, as of today a total 1527 \( [Greek Ministry](http://www.mopocp.gov.gr/index.php?option=ozo_content&lang&perform=view&id=6300&Itemid=653) \), 1528 \( [European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-migration/press-material/docs/state_of_play_-_eu-turkey_en.pdf) \) or 1534 \( [AYS research](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xWVKJMQ3z90m8CsZMNFC7TAyjRgA3puRHFbwZ8YIjUk/edit#gid=1650877223) \) people have been returned to Turkey under the so called “EU\-Turkey Statement”\.

Meanwhile, eight new arrivals have been registered by the Greek authorities on “other” islands\. 15 were transferred from Lesvos to the mainland\. Also, Lighthouse Relief asks for more volunteers on Lesvos to keep the activities going\. More information can be found on their [homepage](https://www.lighthouserelief.org/volunteer/#lesvos) \.
#### Mainland

What should people do, when they have just arrived to Greece through the land border? The Mobile Info Team for refugees in Greece has published a guide in English and Arabic\. You can find it on their Facebook page\.

Residents of Athens now have a new opportunity to volunteer by opening their doors to people in need\. The “Refugees at Home” project aims to connect both groups and conveys a shelter\. As the increased utility costs are one of the biggest financial aspects, they can be covered by financial assistance with donations from overseas\. More information can be found on [http://www\.refugeesathome\.org/](http://www.refugeesathome.org/) or via direct contact to volunteer [Rando Wagner](https://www.facebook.com/rando.wagner/posts/10154996749861035?hc_location=ufi) on Facebook\.

In Patras 65 men have been arrested at the port of Patras during the weekend, trying to board ferries to Italy, NoBorders reports referring to Greek Media\.

### Croatia

The Ministry of the Interior informed today that less than 400 people are accomodated in the reception centre Porin in Zagreb at the moment\. This is a significant decrease compared to the average number of residents of around 550 last year\. Most of the people left to western EU member states, only few went back to Turkey or their countries of origin\. Additionally, on 25th January a group of 43 people will arrive from Turkey to Croatia under the scheme of the resettlement programme\. They will be transferred to the rception centre in Kutina, primarly intended for families with children\.
### Austria

The next deportation from Vienna to Afghanistan is scheduled for 23rd January, according to information of the group [Refugees Linz](https://www.facebook.com/refugeeslinz/posts/1217946695006026) \. Apparently, the Austrian government will share a flight with Norway and Sweden\. Furthermore, a couple of Chechnyan families with children have been detained recently\. “Also, the ‘silent’ deportations to Africa continue” with single deportations to Nigeria, Gambia, Algeria, Morocco, Tunesia and other countries\.
### Switzerland

The number of asylum requests in Switzerland has dropped to the lowest level since 2010 last year, Reuters [reports](http://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN1FB1AZ?feedType=RSS&feedName=worldNews&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A%2BReuters%2FworldNews%2B%28Reuters%2BWorld%2BNews%29&rpc=401&__twitter_impression=true) \. For the first time since then, the number has been below 20\.000\. Compared to 2016, the numbers were lower by one third with a total of 18\.088 asylum requests\. This means less than 50 percent of the applications in 2015, when almost 40\.000 people asked for international protection\. The main nationals in 2017 were Eritreans, making almost half of the number of requests, followed by Syrians, Afghans and Turkey\.

On the Spanish mainland, authorities together with Europol arrested six alleged traffickers, Ansa [reports](http://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/7124/spanish-authorities-and-europol-bust-human-trafficking-operation) \. They are accused of having smuggled people from Kurdistan to Northern Europe in trucks and trains\.
### France
#### 100 minors transferred to a new reception center in Calais

Following our [yesterday’s reports](ays-daily-digest-22-01-18-fascists-set-fire-to-squat-in-thessaloniki-cc4061c4e5b7) about the arrival of some 150 minors in Calais, L’Aubgerge des Migrants [confirmed](http://www.laubergedesmigrants.fr/fr/communique-situation-mineurs-a-calais-traite-de-sandhurst-lamendement-dubs/) this incident and stated, that the number might be as high as 200\. While most of them came because of president Emmanuel Marcon’s visit to Calais, in the hope they get an accellerated family reunion to the UK as part of the Dubs’ scheme, another group, mainly from Eritrea, also showed because ofrumors that there was an opportunity to get relocated to Canada\. The origin of this is not known yet\.

Reacting to this influx, the prefecture reportedly moved around 100 minors to a new center in Pas de Calais\. As neither volunteers nor people on the ground knew about this step and no information was spread before, this created panic connected with the hope of the minors to be transferred to the UK\. “We notice a lot of confusion and a lack of information from official sources,” L’Auberge states\.

In a long read, the Refugee Info Bus has analysed the current situation in Calais since the eviction of the ‘Jungle’ in October 2016\. They conclude: “There is even less understanding of the current situation on the ground” which leads to certain problems\. Although there are some measures to improve the lives of people staying in France — and to encourage them not to try to make it to the UK, the group also sees “the deep mistrust of French government institutions and authorities that currently exists in the minds of asylum seekers will make it difficult to provide better access to the French asylum system\.”
