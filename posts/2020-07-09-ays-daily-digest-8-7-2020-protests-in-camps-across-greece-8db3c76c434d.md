### Protests Against Injustice in Moria and Kos

Across Greece, people are expressing their frustration with the government’s repression of people on the move\.

In Kos, residents are entering the second day of their hunger strike\. [In a video](https://twitter.com/f_grillmeier/status/1280778778961219585) sent to journalist Franziska Grillmeier, people are chanting “We want freedom\!” and using empty water bottles as noisemakers\. People were protesting not just the national policies, but restrictions, often arbitrary, put in place by camp directors and staff\. For example, the administrator of the Kos center recently stopped children [from going to school](https://twitter.com/Refugees_Gr/status/1280982679912095745?fbclid=IwAR2bikFVZ4NfBoGhB4ltVDfIcZHHoHDqNssA4vpIgSL02YxaHlN-btzDdlk) , especially targeting unaccompanied minors\. The reason for this draconian policy? Some children had allegedly left the camp [without permission](http://www.aegeanews.gr/news/dimosias-krisis/342900/refugees-kos-dioikitis-tou-kyt-apagorevei-sta-asynodefta-anilika-pane-scholeio/) \. With such severe restrictions of freedom of movement, is it any wonder that people are protesting?

In Moria, people [mourned the death](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=740892620069828) of a teenage resident in front of the camp asylum office\. The boy was killed during the weekend and is the latest victim of rising tensions in the camp that have been worsened by the psychological stress of lockdown and strict Greek immigration policies\. His blood is on the hands of indifferent policy makers that crowd people in these camps indefinitely, with no public health or safety measures to protect residents\.

All solidarity with people imprisoned in camps who are fighting for their rights\! Basic rights such as the right to move freely and the right to attend school should be available to all, regardless of immigration status\.

SEA
### More People Forcibly Returned to Libya

After spending a week at sea and losing seven of their companions, 18 people on the move were [returned to Libya](https://twitter.com/msehlisafa/status/1280853709581402112) today\. Again, we remind readers that Libya is in the throes of a brutal civil war and people on the move are subject to horrible conditions including torture there\. There is no reason why people should be adrift at sea for a week in the first place or returned to an active war zone\.

After months of reports about brazen, violent pushbacks at EU borders, especially in Croatia and Greece, the Union announced that it would consider implementing a mechanism to monitor and verify pushbacks\. However, such a mechanism [already exists](https://twitter.com/lk2015r/status/1280794974305517568) under the aegis of Frontex, the EU border control agency\. Officers must report suspected violations of human rights, but reports are made very rarely and the reporting mechanism is not independent\. This raises questions about the integrity of an EU reporting mechanism, once implemented — if the plan ever makes it through the EU bureaucracy\.

GREECE
### More Illegal Pushbacks in Greece, Despite Mitarakis’ Denial

Despite Migration Minister Mitarakis’ televised claim that Greece is not engaging in illegal pushbacks \(which is easily debunked by this video [compilation from Aegean Boat Report](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=272275057528807) \), several more instances of illegal pushbacks were reported today alone\.

In [this harrowing video](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCY_s6ColVr/?igshid=1rqg1x476bvnq) , a crowded boat with several children on board is pushed away by the Greek Coast Guard\. The Coast Guard asked for the people to hand over their gasoline so they cannot continue their journey to the shores of Greece\. While the people on board were eventually rescued by the Turkish Coast Guard, the trauma they’d been through will stay with them forever\.

In a separate incident, AlarmPhone [received a distress call](https://www.facebook.com/watchthemed.alarmphone/posts/2706013616339531) from a boat that was taking on water near Rhodes\. They alerted the Coast Guard and several unidentified boats were on the scene, but no rescue was made and AlarmPhone lost contact with the boat in distress\.

The cruelty is blatant\. It has been repeated and recorded over and over again\. Countless lives have been lost, even more people have been further traumatized instead of reaching a place of safety after fleeing their homes\. Meanwhile, as shown in [this blog post](https://www.compas.ox.ac.uk/2020/humanitarian-search-and-rescue-in-the-aegean-sea-stuck-between-two-crises/?fbclid=IwAR2GvdqgsNKbmEbzeSLKnxFLjKW-zNE4x1mp57CXzVoXFEKVwY7ZupEKQf4) by Compas, conditions for rescuers at sea have gotten harder and harder in 2020 between the pandemic, government policies and more\.

When will the EU act to end these abuses?

When discussing the situation in Greek camps, the experience of people with disabilities is often ignored\. People will disabilities often cannot access the medical care they need to manage their conditions and have an even harder time navigating conditions in the camp, which are already difficult for able\-bodied people\.

That’s where organizations like Light Without Borders, which provides free eye care to people on the move in Lesvos, step in\. Light Without Borders was able to help two blind patients, Dek and Mohammed, receive needed treatment including walking sticks and transfer out of the camp\.

You can read more about their work and find out how to donate to Light Without Borders [here](https://www.facebook.com/281582645683403/photos/a.282720915569576/902447073596954/?type=3&theater) \.

SERBIA
### Overcrowding in Camps in Serbia

Across Serbia, people on the move are stuck in horrible living conditions with limited freedom of movement\. From Preševo to Vranje, people are stuck in [overcrowded conditions](https://twitter.com/APC_CZA/status/1280891211344216065?fbclid=IwAR0FXn5t3sLthySfGF5w-GPLKKqeQLLhJR5bfa8ANiO9OHzE9v6cTzckixY) , sometimes three families to a room, which is especially dangerous as coronavirus cases are skyrocketing in Serbia\. The number of people in Subotica near the Hungarian border is [increasing daily](https://twitter.com/APC_CZA/status/1280857556617965568?fbclid=IwAR0q6yw1XIx38fREGlecEfEytBtiHxuNN6k4zTJyMFoCwFFAMk3KqB9UUdE) \. Many try to make dangerous illegal crossings in trucks, and Hungarian police conduct at least 150 violent pushbacks daily\.

The situation in Serbia will likely get worse before it gets better\. Coronavirus cases are growing and President Vučić recently announced another draconian lockdown that Serbians took to the streets to protest\. Last time Serbia was on lockdown, people on the move were completely confined to camps and monitored by the army, and it’s likely that they will face severe restrictions on their freedom of movement yet again\.

ITALY
### Migration Committee Chairperson Supports Call for Relocation

Pierre\-Alain Fridez, a member of the Council of Europe’s Parliamentary Assembly and the chairman of its Migration Committee, [issued a statement](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/migration-committee-chairperson-supports-call-eu-presidency-relocate-rescued-boat?fbclid=IwAR3uZxqnE3oRhDsdUUnXXzUoCLAPVWP7FrsE0c2k4q7Kz3lV5-8tbVeG-xM) supporting calls for a relocation plan for people on the move and equal distribution\. He made this statement in light of the Ocean Viking’s saga and criticized the scramble to find ports willing to accept people in distress\.


> “I strongly welcome yesterday’s appeal by the German EU Presidency to achieve an agreed modus operandi for relocating refugees arriving by boat within the EU, and I fully agree with the German Interior Minister that it is not acceptable to have recourse to telephone diplomacy in order to find a port or country to accept these boats and people in distress\.” 





GERMANY
### Germany Took in 10,000 People from Turkish Camps

According to the Migration Agreement the EU and Turkish signed in 2016, EU countries were supposed to accept people from Turkish refugee camps in exchange for Turkey stopping people from going to Europe\.

Germany [resettled about 10,000 people](https://www.dailysabah.com/politics/germany-took-in-nearly-10000-migrants-under-turkey-eu-deal-report-says/news?fbclid=IwAR2klb12BC5fZtNnv37KbSp8aRD7L8jIie6G5Jl1SBda4KwHDQhjwAR0R_4) , which is more than a third of the total number accepted by the EU\. Less than 27,000 people have been resettled from Turkey in the past four years \(in 2019, UNHCR estimated that there were about [four million people](https://reliefweb.int/report/turkey/unhcr-turkey-fact-sheet-october-2019#:~:text=Attachments&text=Some%204%20million%20refugees%20Turkey,asylum%20seekers%20of%20other%20nationalities.) on the move in Turkey\) \. The EU’s refusal to accept more people is what triggered Turkey’s decision in March to stop enforcing their side of the agreement\.

This figure exposes major flaws in the EU’s migration plans\. Despite the assertion of political leaders, this plan did not end attempted crossings at sea or deaths, partially because there is no mechanism in place offering asylum legally and people have no options besides attempting the crossing\. The lack of solidarity exhibited since 2016 also means that any deals to redistribute people seeking asylum across the EU, which officials from Malta and other Mediterranean countries are calling for, are likely doomed from the start\. Finally, even though 10,000 people is a pathetically low number compared to how many people are stuck in camps in Greece, Turkey and beyond, this disparity could be weaponized by far\-right German politicians to stop further acceptance of people on the move\.

Police in Brandenburg’s Wunsdorf\-Waldstadt Asylum camp arbitrarily [arrested](https://www.facebook.com/RefugeeBlackBox/posts/1215749662097096?hc_location=ufi) at least three people from Africa, and nobody knows why\. We will continue monitoring this story\.

NETHERLANDS
### Pandemic and Misinformation Causing Stress for People on the Move

Researchers in the Netherlands found that the pandemic was exacerbating an existing [mental health crisis](https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-misinformation-is-leading-to-fake-news-anxieties-in-dutch-refugee-communities-141830?fbclid=IwAR2y25PEnebANGAZmQx09p1JeFVj-tkeJw8ELLTg1v1MDTGRE0_UgrhJbKs) in reception centers\. On top of the existing stress caused by long asylum procedures now prolonged by lockdown delays, many experienced traumatic flashbacks because of the pandemic, especially people from Africa who lived through the Ebola pandemic\.

Their mental health was further impacted by a lack of communication from the Dutch government, that failed to translate relevant information in languages people on the move might understand\. Nonprofits had to step up and provide translation services themselves, but their work was impacted by lockdown and they’re unable to perform many of their usual vital services, such as helping people navigate Dutch bureaucracy\. This information vacuum made it easier for rumors to spread, from fake cures to scaremongering about what the government would do to asylum seekers\.

BELGIUM
### Sudanese People Between a Rock and a Hard Place in Belgium

There is a sizable community of Sudanese people on the move in Belgium, many of whom are sleeping rough\.

Most Sudanese in Belgium fled the ongoing violence in their home country, especially in Darfur\. Many wish to seek asylum in the UK, but arriving there and applying for asylum is nearly impossible now and they get stuck in Belgium and northern France\. Many either cannot apply for asylum in Belgium because of the Dublin agreement or are afraid to do so because of the Belgian government’s cooperation with the Sudanese security forces on deportations, often resulting in the torture of returnees\. As such, many people on the move from Sudan fall through the cracks of the existing support system and cannot access aid reserved for asylum seekers, aid which is even harder to access now as a result of the pandemic\.

You can read more about their experiences [here](https://africanarguments.org/2020/07/08/trapped-by-covid-and-a-hostile-europe-sudanese-migrants-and-refugees-in-belgium/?fbclid=IwAR2jZClfeih2mAucq4j384mo4-18LrNucDbgdp7mhRnX2A3vtWwOBJZqQCw) \.

UK
### Twin Brothers, Born in UK, Face Deportation

Darrell Roberts is [facing deportation](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/07/london-born-twins-face-deportation-to-different-countries?fbclid=IwAR1mZ3WlMsr17sj0Cx5VnVOuzMfTL5_xq9FrFEMffP_x8ZH0CrM_ddQIeyo) to the Dominican Republic, a country he has no connection to — their father was born in Dominica\. His brother Darren is facing deportation to Grenada, their mother’s birthplace\.

Both young men were born in London\. They spent part of their childhood in foster care after the death of their mother and social services didn’t bother to begin citizenship procedures for them\.

The two are currently serving prison sentences and instead of looking forward to their release and rejoining society, and for Darren—reuniting with his partner and their young child—now they dread it because they will be deported to countries they’ve never been to and can’t even rely on each other for comfort\.

The UK’s policy of automatically deporting non\-citizens who serve more than 12 months in prison and of denying citizenship based on the “good character requirement,” even if the applicant was born in the country, is unconscionable\. This means non\-citizens face twice the punishment for committing the same crime citizens do — a prison sentence and losing their home\.

It’s also unbelievable that someone who has such little knowledge of the world that they don’t understand that Dominica and the Dominican Republic are two different countries, or can’t be bothered to check that they’re deporting someone to the “right” country, can decide the course of a person’s entire life\.
