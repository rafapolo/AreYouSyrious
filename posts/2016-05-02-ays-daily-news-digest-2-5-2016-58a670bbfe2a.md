### [AYS DAILY NEWS DIGEST 2\.5\.2016\.](ays-news-digest-1-5-2016-72604bb84219)
#### Even as the war is still raging in Iraq and Syria, the first trial over war crimes in Syria is to be held in Germany\. All the while, the number of refugees stranded in Greece continues to rise, with new recorded deaths on the coast of Italy\. Eurostat came out with new data on unaccompanied minors with an all time high number\.
