#### FEATURE — **Greek government targets organizations and individuals who observe and document human rights violations, and the pressure involves secret service and EU funding**

Greek police accused ten \(at the time unnamed\) people to have facilitated the “illegal entry for foreigners”\. Those involved are also accused of espionage as well as „impeding investigations“\. Some of them are also said to have violated immigration law\. However, no arrests or searches have been made so far\. Four of these people had been working for NGOs\.


[![]()](https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/07/22/greek-authorities-target-ngos-reporting-abuses-against-migrants)


The main accusations are literally the content of some of the NGOs’ work:

The suspects are alleged to have operated „applications on the internet“ and informed about „migration flows“ from Turkey\. With the help of „telephone connections, “ they would have received coordinates of boats with refugees and passed them on to other activists, who would then have observed the course until arrival at the Greek mainland\. During the exchange of information, the number of boat occupants and their medical conditions were also of interest, the officials wisely noted\.

Publishing information, among others, on the illegal pushbacks by the Greek coast guard online via photos and videos, is what some of the organisations are dedicated to doing\. The very same videos are now used as evidence of alleged espionage: The suspects are alleged to have published media that revealed classified information about Greek coast guard vessels and facilities\.

Of course, this is not the first dubious investigation against human rights activists pressured by the Greek authorities\.

In September 2020 the Greek police h [ad made public similar investigations](https://www.kathimerini.gr/society/561103954/i-epicheirisi-alkmini-tis-eyp-gia-tis-mko/) against 35 foreign nationals and members of various organisations from Germany, France, Switzerland, Austria, Norway and Bulgaria with „Operation Alcmene“\. On the radar of the authorities is, for exmaple, the organisation Alarm Phone/Watch the Med, which is based in several countries and operates an emergency telephone for refugees on the high seas\.

There have of yet been no indictments\.

In addition to the Greek police, the migration ministry, the foreign authorities and the coast guard, the civil\-military domestic secret service EYP, and the anti\-terror department DAEEB are also involved in the investigations\. Through the Directorate for Information Management and Analysis \(DIDAP\), which is also participating and whose establishment [was supported by EU funds in 2016](https://www.ekathimerini.com/news/221327/intelligence-services-to-get-boost/) , information on the persons concerned could be retrieved from EU databases\. The agency [acts as an international contact point](http://www.astynomia.gr/index.php?option=ozo_content&perform=view&id=55028&Itemid=13&lang=EN) for the processing of aircraft passenger data, among other things\.

In the course of the investigation, two mobile phones attributed to two foreign activists, as well as laptops and mobile phones, were seized by the police in September\.

Meanwhile, the secret service should be professional regarding espionage: In the past year it became known that the EYP had sent two spies to Turkey\.

#### EU
### NGOs called European countries to immediately suspend deportation to Afghanistan

On Wednesday July 21, NGOs including Caritas Europe, Save the Children and Pro Asyl also called on the EU Commission to encourage member states to halt deportations\.


> The security situation in Afghanistan does not allow for the return of people to the country without putting their lives at risk\. 




Also, [they demanded](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/33783/ngos-demand-europe-stop-deportations-to-afghanistan?fbclid=IwAR1zmiecpjvNkqD69e4f7F3KM81ANWponZBYp8pAYE0QjC1HrXc85l6zt5c) asylum authorities to “ **reexamine all final negative decisions for Afghan asylum seekers** still present in European countries in the light of the current situation in Afghanistan and foreseeable risks of future persecution being identified as a result of this new situation\.”

As we have been reporting, on July 11, Afghanistan had asked European countries to cease deportations of Afghan nationals for three months due to an uptick in fighting between state forces and the Taliban\. In response, Finland and [Sweden](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/33684/sweden-follows-finland-suspends-deportations-to-afghanistan) recently decided to suspend all deportations to the country\.

Instead of housing people leaving the region given this escalating situation, the EU is weighing a new package of financial aid intended for keeping away people wanting to enter Europe\.


> The EU plan, which is at a preparatory phase, would involve more financial help to Afghanistan, Pakistan and countries in the region, two EU officials and one diplomat familiar with the talks told Reuters, with money also being given to Iran\. 





Turkey, which is set to receive new EU funds to house people leaving the region towards Europe, could play a role in housing more Afghans, but any new [funding for Afghanistan would be separate](https://www.ekathimerini.com/news/1165025/as-war-rages-eu-weighs-more-funds-to-limit-afghans-fleeing-to-bloc/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&fbclid=IwAR1zmiecpjvNkqD69e4f7F3KM81ANWponZBYp8pAYE0QjC1HrXc85l6zt5c) from the planned 3\.5 billion euros for Turkey until 2024\.

### **36 people rescued off Crete**

Late Thursday, 36 people were rescued after a sailboat was stranded in high winds and sank off the island of Crete\.

The boat carried about 45 people, so about 9 people are missing\. The search is ongoing\.

5 people rescued were taken to the nearby island of Karpathos, while the others were transferred to a passing cargo ship\.

### **Germany’s MoI announced financial support to Greece that would keep people out of Germany**

In order to stave off the departure of people on the move toward Germany, the country offered financial support to Greece\. This comes after a series of German court decisions prohibiting the return of people to Greece because of a “serious risk that they would not be able to meet their most basic needs if they return\.”

Instead of taking those grave concerns seriously, German authorities decided to continue the outsourcing of responsibility according to …European Asylum laws\.

### **At least 17 people drowned off the Tunisian coast**

A boat heading from Libya to Italy and carrying more than 380 people from Syria, Egypt, Sudan, Eritrea, Mali and Bangladesh sank off the Tunisian coast on Wednesday, July 21\. In the shipwreck, at least 17 people drowned, while more than 380 were rescued by the Tunisian coast guard, Tunisian Red Crescent reported\.

Meanwhile, IOM r [eported](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/33787/at-least-17-migrants-dead-off-tunisian-coast-1?fbclid=IwAR2ghNnBwbAE6IslEsMCkagT8yGEtIYcKcROf-nBW0neTe3yabgpdDqDRyA) as many as 500 people intercepted by Libya’s coast guard in the last 24 hours, who are now being held in detention centers\.
### **SeaWatch3 leaves Burriana for the Central Mediterranean corridor off Libya**

Today, the SeaWatch3 prepares to leave Spain for a new mission in the Central Mediterranean\.

122 days ago, the ship disembarked 363 people in Augusta, with a further 90 or so people assisted in the ship’s life rafts after onboard capacity was exceeded\. In the meantime, the ship was held in a blockade, pretexted technical defects found in the so\-called “security check”\.

The following ships remain out of action in Burriana Port:

Open Arms and Ajita Mari \(both under the Spanish flag\) as well as Alan Kurdi and Louise Michel \(both under the German flag\) \.

### **32 people rescued off the Italian coast of Locri**

People of various origin were spotted and rescued by Coast Guard’s patrol boats after their boat disembarked\. They were temporarily taken to the first aid center in Roccella, the media [reported](https://www.ansa.it/calabria/notizie/2021/07/22/migranti-32-soccorsi-in-mare-al-largo-costa-locride_fb15c84e-887c-4bf5-8632-96e5252212aa.html?fbclid=IwAR1lXOxtrGEabgCfLvDpb6QlgDT9jhTCHoa0Qk6whaRf2T1_WA7egxkaQmI) \.
#### BELGIUM
### **Over 450 people ended 2\-month hunger strike after government announced willingness to renegotiate**

The strikers demanded asylum negotiations, as most of them come from Morocco and Algeria, which are recognized in the EU as safe countries of origin\. Most strikers lived in Belgium for years remaining unrecognized, their work and life situation worsened by the pandemic\.

Abdeslam, 42, from Algeria:


> “Despite all our skills and the fact that we are here to work, not to just collect money, the answer remains the same, to ‘go home\.’” 





The strike began May 23\. After two long months, meetings between Belgian government representatives and those representing the striking people resulted in a breakthrough this Wednesday, when authorities suggested that all the cases would be reassessed without prejudice and that at least some migrants would be able to claim “exceptional circumstances” to remain\.

About 300 people had announced earlier that they were refusing water, with MDM warning that death was possible “at any moment”\. Some had even stitched their lips together earlier this month, challenging government inaction\.

Pressure on the government increased days earlier, when some partners of the governing coalition threatened to withdraw their ministers if any of the hunger strikers died, which put the government at risk of falling\.


> At the moment it is still unclear how many people will ultimately gain the right to remain in the country\. 




Meanwhile, some people had to be wheeled out of the places they had been occupying, such as the Church of St\. John the Baptist at the Beguinage; many required first aid or were taken to the hospital\.

Each person will reportedly quickly be informed about his or her respective options regarding a residence permit in Belgium, according to reports\.
#### SPAIN
### 240 people jump Melilla’s fences

Alarm Phone reported that around 240 people managed to jump Melilla’s fences this morning\. More than 300 people attempted to cross the six\-metre \(20 foot\) barrier early Thursday morning\.
### Cantabria agrees to host 20 unaccompanied minors from the Canary Islands

Related to the signing of collaboration protocols between the regional government and the authorities of the Canary Islands and Ceuta, Cantabria will soon take in 27 unaccompanied minors\. The Cantabrian government will assume responsibility for their guardianship and comprehensive protection until they come of age, it was reported\. This is in addition to 36 minors previously taken in by the Cantabrian government, but **it still falls short of** **the number — 120 — that was agreed upon by the authorities in 2019\.**

Vice president and spokesman of the Cantabrian executive, Pablo Zuloaga, [emphasized the decision](https://www.eldiario.es/canariasahora/migraciones/cantabria-acogera-20-menores-migrantes-no-acompanados-procedentes-canarias_1_8160479.html?fbclid=IwAR1YSBaj7YUp318tEDHhnRiZ2Smf9y0wLo-0rtEUSSsyJIvg6eMq0XvzAog) of the autonomous community to be “supportive” and “sensitive” to the overflow situation that the care systems of the Canary Islands and Ceuta are experiencing\. Zuloaga recalled the Spanish government’s commitment to distribute 5 million euros in the second half of the year to the autonomous communities taking in unaccompanied minors\.

### **Lambeth agreed to take 100 children instead of 20**

The London district Lambeth passed an amendment at last night’s full council that commits the council to take in 100 unaccompanied child asylum seekers instead of 20\.

### **Majority of people resettled in the UK between 2010 and 2020 were from countries affected by war**

Contrary to the claims of government and politicians spinning yarns about people arriving as so\-called economic migrants, the [research reveals](https://bylinetimes.com/2021/07/22/priti-patel-nigel-farage-and-the-fake-news-around-asylum-claims/?fbclid=IwAR2O8NDlkqZL-vAkNVR447dFfPzG2DSJNZhHd_NFb5jUOd-0NDHmdi_BHj8) the majority came from Middle Eastern countries affected by war \(75%\); 68% of these were from Syria\.


> The data makes it obvious that anti\-refugee claims by politicians like Home Secretary Priti Patel and Nigel Farage are part of a rh etorical strategy to spread fake news around asylum\. 



#### GENERAL
### ISD published a report on Networks and Narratives of Anti\-Refugee Disinformation in Europe

The Institute for Strategic and Dialog released a new [report](https://www.isdglobal.org/digital_dispatches/the-networks-and-narratives-of-anti-refugee-disinformation-in-europe/?fbclid=IwAR3qi3asoI9JKN8-q50S-mnSK31P2b8AURNt0dxtJq3jAiqKQMH0J71v1Dc) analysing different networks associated with anti\-refugee disinformation and hatred in Greek, German and English\.

The research highlights that networks of far\-right extremists and elements of the political right sharing common audiences and using similar tactics do not work in isolation, and reveals the dynamics by which anti\-refugee disinformation is spread\.

Some key findings:
- The Greek so\-called “refugee crisis” attracted and activated an international cohort of extremist actors\.
- Anti\-refugee disinformation has provided a crucial nexus for a range of far\-right extremists, nativists, and conspiracy theorists to overlap with political actors\.
- Elected officials were found to play a role in the amplification of anti\-refugee disinformation and hatred\.
- The Evros border incident and the fires in camps in Moria highlight how key events can act as flashpoints for transnational, multilingual spikes in anti\-refugee mobilisation\.
- NGOs working with people on the move are common targets for harassment and disinformation, both online and offline\.


As far as broader implications of the analysis, the authors state:


> “The key findings outlined in this article highlight the way in which networks are activated around key crises, such as events on the Evros border or the fires in Moria, to agitate around long\-established hostilities against refugees, minority groups, and the organisations who are deemed to have helped them\. The fluidity of these networks helps keep migration consistently relevant to a multitude of different extremist ecosystems and makes clear that while migration to Europe has reduced dramatically, anti\-migrant discourse has evolved to focus on the migrants already there\.”
