### SEA

Another high rescue day in the Med with 232 people being transferred to Sea Watch 3 \(after 117 were rescued earlier\) and 120 people being rescued by Sea Eye\. Unfortunately, one person drowned before the final rescue to Sea Eye\.
### GREECE


> The Aegean Boat Report notes that 47 people have arrived in Samos\. 




Additionally a group of around 20 people from Iraq were rescued and returned to Corfu, with the commander of the boat, reportedly their trafficker, arrested\. [The full circumstances of their rescue remain unclear\.](http://www.amna.gr/en/article/263922/Refugees-from-Iraq-rescued-off-Corfu-trafficker-arrested)

No calm for refugees in Moria\. According to Greek news outlets, although authorities and the heads of the Kurdish community \(many of whom voluntarily left Moria in the aftermath of an outbreak of violence between groups of refugees there\) were attempting to negotiate a return of this community to the camp, this attempt was disrupted by another eruption of violence\.

_“The attacks had begun early in the morning and were sporadic, but at sunset they grew, resulting in widespread petroleum warfare between the two communities and four injuries had occurred by 4 o’clock\._

_Inside the police intervened vigorously and until late at night there were ongoing efforts to restore order\._

_It should be noted that these attacks are coming at a crucial moment, when the contacts and negotiations between the authorities and the Kurds on their return to Moria seemed to be effective\.”_

However, InfoMigrants sheds a slightly more sinister light upon the subject, noting that the hundreds of people who left Moria on 25 May are being intimidated into returning through threats of losing their access to food and financial allowances, as well as to appointments with the asylum service\. This is yet another case of forcing refugees to be punished for policies made without their voice\.

The Greek Forum for refugees highlights that the religious and/or ethnic dimensions to these outbreaks of violence have been overemphasized in reporting, noting that the primary cause of tensions are and shall remain vulnerable people being kept in inhumane conditions\.

_“The overpopulation along with the insufficient provision of services and security, intensify the situation\. Refugees who have already been the victims of wars and prosecutions and with many of them already in a state of post\-traumatic stress disorder \(PTSD \), are once more the victims of politics that are adopted in order to serve anything but the interests of refugees\._

_Apropos of the latest conflicts at Moria, the media have given the event false dimensions by saying that the conflict of some individuals is attributed to religious and political issues, while it is obvious that the conflicts are the result of the living conditions that have existed for some time now\. The GFR, which is always in contact with the refugees in the hotspots and constantly watches their progress along with the Refugee Communities, condemns any form of violence and the politics of the EU \(the Turkey agreement\) as well national politics\.”_

The situation across Greek camps is dire, with those on the islands suffering greatly\. I Am You reports of the water shortage in Greece and how this has been severely affecting those members of the refugee community who have chosen to take part in Ramadan\. I Am You reports that water shortages around Ritsona have resulted in the [water being shut off for several hours](https://www.facebook.com/iamyourescue/photos/a.1012648618776866.1073741828.1011437275564667/2054295714612146/?type=3) at a time, severely impacting people trapped in the hot sun\.

In the UNHCR report for Lesvos, the acknowledgement of overcrowding is made clear\. Additionally, [InfoMigrants](http://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/9706/greece-has-wide-disparities-in-standards-among-its-migrant-detention-centers) relays that the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture recently took a visit to “pre\-detention” \(what does this even mean?\) facilities in the Evros region on the mainland \(where there has been a great influx of refugees fleeing in the aftermath of the fall of Afrin\) and found the living situations to be horrific\. “During its visit, the CPT found 95 people detained in about one square metre of living space per person, in extremely filthy conditions\. In addition, conditions in police stations in the Evros region were described as “grossly sub\-standard\.” The cells at the Isaakio police station were found “filthy and full of waste” and the “sanitary annexes had not been cleaned\.”

Additionally, yesterday there was a rescue operation on the Evros river delta\. No lives were in imminent danger\.

“The same source says that there are about 20 people, among them children\. In the rescue operation, police forces as well as other special forces are involved in order to transport people safely from islet, who are not in danger, as the water level of the river is low” [Source](https://www.amna.gr/macedonia/article/263509/Se-exelixi-epicheirisi-apegklobismou-paratupon-metanaston) \.
### EU

The executive director of the European Asylum Support Office Jose Carreira stepped down from his position in the aftermath of accusations of bullying and using psychological violence against other members of the organization\. Although Mr\. Carreira denies the allegations, the investigation conducted by the OLAF anti\-fraud office noted that his actions promoted a “culture of irresponsibility\.”

His decision pre\-empted a discussion of his role at a meeting to be held today and yesterday and it was agreed that his resignation would be accepted in advance of the normal expiry of his contract in September, although he will continue to receive his salary until then\. It should be noted that the budget for EASO has more than tripled since 2015, with a provisional figure of 69 million euros standing in 2017\. [Source](https://www.politico.eu/article/jose-carreira-easo-under-investigation-director-of-eu-asylum-agency-steps-down/) \.

One could find an interesting comparison in that refugees fleeing violence are given two weeks to return to possibly dangerous situations in Moria or risk losing their benefits; meanwhile, a man who has been accused of bullying and gross negligence will enjoy his presumably handsome salary to the end of his term, provided he resigns\. This is Europe, there are rules, after all\.
### BULGARIA

The trial of the Harmanli 21 was postponed yet again\. Some protestors showed up in solidarity with the 10 of the accused who were present in court for the announcement\. These protestors displayed a banner calling for freedom for these people in multiple languages\. When one of the accused thanked the protestors, he was silenced, and the protestors were ushered out of the courtroom\.

For the uninitiated, the Harmanli 21 are individuals who were residing in the Harmanli refugee camp in Bulgaria\. In the aftermath of protests, police randomly gathered these 21 individuals and accused them of hooliganism and destruction of property, with the media often ignoring the deplorable conditions and continued violence against refugees residing there\. For more updates on the trial, please [go to Bordermonitorin\.eu](http://bulgaria.bordermonitoring.eu/2018/06/06/trial-against-the-harmanli-21-posponed-again/) \.
### **SPAIN**

Two individuals needed hospitalization after an attempt to jump the razor\-wire fence at Ceuta resulted in severing arteries in the arms\. Approximately 400 people have attempted to breach the fence system recently, with very limited success in no small part due to the blades installed along the top of the fence\. Furthermore of these 400, only 150 had reached this deadly outer fence, the [others failing at earlier barriers and being detained by Moroccan police](http://www.publico.es/sociedad/inmigracion-400-inmigrantes-tratan-atravesar-valla-ceuta-entrar-herido.html) \.

### **BELGIUM**

The Belgian Secretary of State wants to bypass UN anti\-torture treaty

_Theo Francken \(N\-VA, Belgian Secretary of State for Asylum and Migration, has argued that Belgium ought to bypass Article Three of the ECHR \(European Convention on Human Rights\), the anti\-torture treaty\. According to Francken, this is necessary to be able to drag the refugee boats back to where they come from\. The French\-speaking opposition parties PS and Défi have asked for his resignation \._

_Francken is in favor of “pushbacks” — “We must all be able to send those boats back\. We have to try to find a way around Article Three\.”_

_After this remarks caused an upheaval in the parliament, Francken said that he did not really mean that he wanted to bypass the anti\-torture treaty, but “only its strict interpretation by the European Court of Human Rights”\. He explained that he wants to close a deal with Tunisia in order to be able to tow boats back there\._

It should be noted that Tunisia has stopped 6,000 people from leaving Tunisia to date this year\.

This should be viewed in the context of the tragic shipwreck that happened off of Tunisia last Saturday night\. Here are some further stories about the people who survived or, sadly, did not\.

### GERMANY

After nearly a year, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has stated there is no reason to halt deportations to Afghanistan\. The initial interruption came in the aftermath of a deadly bombing attack in Kabul that affected the German embassy\. The next deportation flight is scheduled for 26 June\.

According to [Beyond Europe](https://www.facebook.com/beyondeurope/posts/1698787703533090) , the number of racist attacks in Germany in 2017 was 4149\. The breakdown is as follows:

Racist violence in Germany\. Number of registered racist attacks in 2017: 4149

Attacks on refugee´s accommodation: 412
 Attacks on refugees: 1906
 Attacks on mosques and other Muslim infrastructure: 52
 Attacks on Muslims: 758
 Attacks on synagogues, Jewish cemeteries, and Shoah memorials: 63
 Attacks on Jews: 958

They also provide a mapping of these attacks

### SWEDEN

The government in Sweden is split regarding asylum politics\. Tomorrow the parties will vote on a new law about the right of young asylum seekers to stay in Sweden if they attend school\. This new potential law is in addition to the previous “high school law” and will apply to approximately 9000 people who otherwise wouldn’t have the chance to continue their high school education and stay in Sweden\.

Tomorrow the outcome of the vote will depend, basically, on one party, since the parties are divided into two main blocks and one party from the block against implementing this will most likely cross over to the other block vote in favor\. This may, hopefully, mean that 9000 young people will continue to be granted protection at least during the rest of their high school studies\.
