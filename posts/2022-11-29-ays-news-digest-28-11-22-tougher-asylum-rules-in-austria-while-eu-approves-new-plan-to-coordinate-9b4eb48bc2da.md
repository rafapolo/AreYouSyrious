### Tensions between European countries over migration topic lead to a new plan with ‘little new’


> The new plan would see Brussels work more closely with Tunisia, Libya and Egypt to try to stop undocumented migrants boarding smuggler vessels in the first place 





This is what the ‘new’ migration plan approved by the EU in recent days seems to have led to: a further step in the process of externalising European borders\. The words above, quoted from [this article](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20221126-eu-ministers-endorse-new-migrant-plan-after-france-italy-tensions?fbclid=IwAR1nUL3BvWW4Buk8pnd5e3fy40LsCy2UFBNjPTvnP1GCgv19Rz9_dI_fPx0) , are proof of this\. Europe continues to stand by and, indeed, collaborate with the atrocities against migrants in Libya while the French and Italian governments bicker amongst themselves\. Meanwhile, people die\. They die at sea, they die waiting to disembark, they die because Europe only shows walls even on arrival\.

France accused Italy of failing to respect the law of the sea by rejecting an NGO ship earlier this month, triggering crisis talks in Brussels\. The meetings resulted in the new plan of sharing responsibilities between EU countries\. The plan doesn’t really show anything new, but calmed down the tensions between the two countries\. A new meeting will be held on 8th December\. Read more here:
