**FEATURED: SHOCKING ATTEMPT TO BURN ASYLUM SEEKERS ALIVE IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE ANTI\-MIGRANT PROTEST**

Five young migrants from the Maghreb region were nearly burned alive in an unexpected attack at their makeshift home in a well\-known migrant hub, in a town in northern Bosnia\. The attack happened around the time of an anti\-migrant protest in the nearby town of Velika Kladuša\. Out of fear for their safety, the victims asked us not to share the exact location of the incident or their names\.


> Everything happened so suddenly\. It’s hard for me to say how many people attacked us, but I know there were five of us in the house\. When the sun set down, everything felt so calm, and then they came out of nowhere and started throwing Molotov cocktails at the house\. It felt like nearly ten Molotovs, but it happened so suddenly I couldn’t really count\. The place where we sleep is an old wooden house and it caught fire within seconds\. I thank God all of us managed to escape before the fire caught us\. If I were just a bit slower, I’d be burned alive\. I’m still in shock\. I don’t know why they did \[this\] to us\. What did we ever do to them? How can I sleep after all of this? Not to mention it took me two weeks to collect the things I had in that house, and now everything is gone… _\(one of the men said to our volunteer immediately after the incident\)_ 





Local firemen extinguished the fire, but the victims told us there were no police officers who would be interested in pursuing the case\.

“They just didn’t care\. They put out the fire and that was it”, the young man told us\.

He described how he previously tried to cross the border to Croatia and Slovenia 19 times, and every time he was illegally pushed back\.


> “Last time I tried to cross three weeks ago\. I asked for asylum, but they told me there was no asylum for me\. They caught me in Croatia and pushed me back to Bosnia\. The time before, I managed to enter deep into Slovenia, I was maybe 20 minutes from Ljubljana when they caught me\. They took me off a train and returned me to Croatia, and then again to Bosnia\. Every time they say “no asylum”, no matter how much I tried\. I know they are lying to us, I have friends in asylum centres in Croatia and Slovenia, but I was never allowed to ask for asylum, even if I tried to do it in the asylum centre\. They just don’t accept us anywhere” — _the man described bitterly\._ 





He and his friends received volunteer support last night and hoped to spend the night in another squatted house, where some of their friends sleep\. They feel like there’s no safe place for them anymore\. It’s hard to find words of comfort when it seems it really is true\.

Despite this testimony, [Bosnian media reported](https://avaz.ba/vijesti/bih/586880/sokantan-video-migranti-zapalili-kucu-u-drmaljevu-kod-velike-kladuse?fbclid=IwAR2UPKLQ7THRuP1PcExASGoF7IEPL17Qudxi6aScHv7ke46tr6utlhR4ZjU) that the people living in the house set fire to it themselves, fuelling tensions in the area\.

TURKEY
#### **62 people arrested in Turkey**

During police searches in Istanbul approximately 62 people from Afghanistan have been found since the start of the month\. [According to media](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/turkey/62-irregular-migrants-held-in-istanbul/1936352?fbclid=IwAR22Dd9hoedl_b3r3rfEUwgPVt5fpTfHPRes8VCZ2F4AfykDOg_wZabX6h0) , they are now in police custody, it is unclear what will happen to them next\. At least five of them are children and none had residence permits or passports\. According to the UN [at least 100,000 people have been internally displaced](https://www.rferl.org/a/un-says-more-than-100-000-afghans-displaced-by-conflict-this-year/30757023.html) in Afghanistan so far this year due to continued fighting\. There are currently about 3\.7 million refugees in Turkey — more than than any other country in the world\.

LIBYA
#### From Bin Walid detention centre

The number of desperate reports of torture and rape inside Bin Walid detention centre is increasing, writes Giulia Tranchina, and from this photo it seems malnourishment and starvation are also likely\.

#### Turkey uses brokers to recruit minors and jihadists for Libya

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights \(SOHR\) [report](https://www.syriahr.com/en/178741/?fbclid=IwAR1nDXUJoMEUADbE5yDyz7lWliBQrUPLo8UV_57kSijWb8VG5KeTdqk-4_g) that Turkey is using brokers to recruit older men, minors and jihadists to fight for the Turkish\-backed Government of National Accord \(GNA\) in Libya\. Brokers obtain a one\-time payment for each recruit and “are taking advantage of the catastrophic economic situation in the areas under Turkish influence\.”

17,300 Syrian fighters have been deployed by Turkey in Libya since last year\. The most recent groups arrived in Libya earlier this week\. According to SOHR information, at least 350 minors are among the fighters\. “ [Out of 481 Syrian militants killed in Libya, at least 34 were minors, under the age of 18\.](https://www.syriahr.com/en/178326/) ”

GREECE
#### Arrivals

Aegean Boat Report published their monthly statistics for July 2020\.


■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 
> **[Aegean Boat Report](https://twitter.com/ABoatReport) @ Twitter Says:** 

> > In July, 13 boats arrived on the #Greek #Aegean islands, carrying 364 people.

49 boats with 1,623 people were picked up by the #Turkish Coast Guard. Many of these had been pushed back into Turkish waters by the Greek Coast Guard. #Greece #Turkey https://t.co/wsUoeyhzoJ 

> **Tweeted at [2020-08-08 06:05:10](https://twitter.com/aboatreport/status/1291978742680686592).** 

■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 


Also, ABR [reported](https://web.facebook.com/AegeanBoatReport/posts/892087924647646) on one boat landing on the northern shore of Lesvos in the night between Friday and Sunday\. It carried 48 people \(26 children, 11 women and 11 men\) \. They will be taken to the quarantine camp in Megala Thermis, Lesvos north for 14 days quarantine due to the coronavirus, where at the moment there are 79 people\. Seventy people are in the quarantine facility at Kara Tepe, Lesvos south\.

Greek Media [report](https://www.ekathimerini.com/255626/article/ekathimerini/news/migrant-flows-low-but-asylum-applications-high) that “despite the significant decrease in migrant flows from Turkey to the Greek islands in recent months, the number of asylum applications remains high as 98,279 decisions are still pending\.” From May to July, it is reported, 1,300 people arrived on the coasts of the eastern Greek islands, most of them on Lesvos\. In the same period of 2019, 12,911 people arrived\.
#### More pushbacks in the Aegean Sea

Alarm Phone [reported](https://web.facebook.com/watchthemed.alarmphone/posts/2732638560343703) on Sunday morning that the Hellenic Coast Guard put 35 people on life\-rafts, and left them adrift south of Lesvos\. After being alerted, the Turkish Coast Guard confirmed that they rescued 80 people from life\-rafts\.

LESVOS
#### Moria: Another fire while plans for closed reception centre go ahead\.

On Sunday night a fire broke out just outside the entrance of the camp\. Causes are still under investigations, but people living in the camp say “fascists entered the camp and put fire\.”


■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 
> **[Mortaza](https://twitter.com/mortazabehboudi) @ Twitter Says:** 

> > ❌ Video from #Moria camp: « fascists put fire in the camp » tonight in upper levels between Olivier grove tents and the entrance of the camp. The fire will be on investigation but #refugeesgr are saying the fascists entered the camp and put fire. https://t.co/tJbI7lmgs4 

> **Tweeted at [2020-08-09 20:02:40](https://twitter.com/mortazabehboudi/status/1292551895161208832).** 

■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 


The fire was later extinguished by the very people living in Moria, despite the authorities’ intervention\. Activists [pointed out](https://twitter.com/feminazida/status/1292554044012220418) that this fire happened in the same week when far\-right groups have called for a presence on the island\.

Moreover, plans for turning the hotspot into a closed centre are going ahead on the island\. On the 6 August the Official Gazette [published](https://www.stonisi.gr/post/10597/kai-epishma-h-nea-moria-poy-feygei) that two pieces of land — for a total of 43 acres — were rented by the Interior and Migration ministries for 2020 and 2021\. They are located in Marmaro and Mantzaris and it is reported that the lease includes permits for construction of reception facilities\.

As Franziska Grillmaier [stresses](https://twitter.com/f_grillmeier/status/1292679645494738944) , “this also means a shrinking space for documentation of human rights violations”\. The Greek government has used the COVID\-19 emergency to extend the lockdown of the islands’ hotspots \(now extended until the end of August\) and to open the first closed reception centres on the mainland\. It has been extremely difficult to report on the situation in such centres, in a country that is sadly notorious for the horrible conditions of its facilities, the disregard of rights of people in detention and the increasing number of illegal push\-backs\.

On a more positive note, [ELIL — European Lawyers in Lesvos](https://web.facebook.com/EuropeanLawyersInLesvos) have been working to return to full capacity, welcoming volunteers in as safe and responsible a way as possible\. A new lawyer from the UK joined the team on the island\. Read more [HERE](https://web.facebook.com/EuropeanLawyersInLesvos/photos/a.1917504088570340/2688664704787604) \.

ATHENS
#### Updates from Platia Victoria and on Anwar Nillufary’s hunger strike

Anwar started his second hunger strike in front of UNHCR Greece Athens office on 23 June\. As of Sunday, he is on his 47th day without food\. While groups of people have been standing in solidarity with him, no one from UNHCR showed any interest in his situation or his health condition, which is deteriorating\. [Read more on Anwar’s story and support his struggle\.](https://web.facebook.com/HostageOfEurope/posts/924364521385874)

A few hundred meters away, in Platia Victoria, dozens of people are fighting “for the right to live and sleep safely, without any recourse\. The Greek islands are being cleansed of what the Greek government calls ‘rabble’, and thousands of people who had secured refugee status are transferred to Athens\. This trip to leave the islands starts with hope and expectations and ends, unsurprisingly, in frustration,” \(from [a former volunteer of No Name Kitchen](https://web.facebook.com/NoNameKitchenBelgrade/) \) \. Activists and volunteers have been [supporting](https://web.facebook.com/soulfoodforrefugees/posts/971343656672926) individuals and families which are sleeping rough in the Platia, in extremely difficult conditions, especially with the heavy rains of this last weekend\.

MALTA
#### **A week at sea**

The group of [27 people rescued by the tanker Etienne are still not being allowed to disembark](https://newsbook.com.mt/en/rescued-asylum-seekers-stuck-on-tanker-as-malta-denies-entry-alarm-phone/?fbclid=IwAR1-GDzpDR9M2L7Z1CWu6_TV9zBKATOPT8O3HNrHH4F4NcyaJjZ52J8-VBE) in Malta\. They are thought to have left Libya on 3 August and have now been at sea for a full week\. The usual games are being played by those who have the power to save them\. We hope that this kind of activity by authorities will not put commercial ships off from future rescues, though this is likely one of the aims\.

ITALY
#### More people arriving from Tunisia than from Libya

Arrivals in Italy are on the rise, around 15,000 since the beginning of the year, but still very far from being any kind of emergency for a G7 country with a population of 60 million\. Instead the Italian right is stirring its followers and blaming people on the move for new coronavirus spikes and comparing them to tourists on cruises\. In 2020, more people on the move have arrived in Italy from Tunisia than from Libya\. The Tunisian economy has plummeted in the last year, with the former president warning the parliament that most public companies were in bankruptcy and the COVID\-19 pandemic has only worsened the situation, especially hitting migrant workers, who are resorting to leaving for Europe\. Politico [published](https://www.politico.eu/article/tunisia-italy-migration-irregular/) an interesting analysis of the latest discussions about migration to Italy\. Sadly, they too failed to point out that among the reasons for the recent spike in boats from Tunisia is the support given by Italy to the Libyan Coast Guard, the increasing number of instances in which EU authorities failed to provide assistance to boats in distress, the thousands of people returned to Libya, the seizing of humanitarian rescue\. A series of policies that were exactly intended to drastically and criminally reduce the number of arrivals from Libya\.
#### Sicily tightens anti\-COVID measures, especially regarding people on the move

Over the weekend, the Sicilian governor introduced new measures to prevent the increase of COVID\-19 cases on the island, following local spikes in the recent days\. One measure bans the use of tent structures as temporary reception centres in the island, introduces compulsory swab tests for all people who arrive on the island and enforces tighter quarantine measures\.

These measures are a response to the perceived high numbers of people on the move who tested positive to the virus\. It is important to underline, as recent articles [have pointed out](http://www.mediterraneocronaca.it/2020/08/08/migranti-selvaggi-e-mangiatori-di-cani-tra-fake-news-e-propaganda-razzista-lezione-di-stile-dallassociazione-tunisini-in-italia/) , that such high numbers are too often the consequence of failed quarantine measures on Italian soil\.
#### Demonstration in Udine, Tuesday 11th August

Ospiti in Arrivo has launched a protest for tomorrow, 11 August, at 5:30 pm in front of the local Prefettura, to protest against the third extension of the lockdown for the reception centre in the ex\-caserma Caverzani\. Increasing numbers of people have been taken into the centre over the last few months, reaching and overtaking its capacity\. No one has been allowed to leave it since March\.

[Find out about the demo HERE\.](https://web.facebook.com/events/3126714274105320/)

SPAIN
#### **Two 13\-year\-old children drown in Valencia Port**

[Two children who had stowed away](https://amp.levante-emv.com/sucesos/2020/08/08/ninos-ahogan-saltar-agua-puerto/2039406.html?__twitter_impression=true) on a cargo ship jumped into the sea as they reached the port\. It is believed that they were trying to evade authorities as they thought they would be retuned to the country from which they had fled\. As a result of their attempted escape, they both drowned\.

It is not currently known where they are from or when they boarded the vessel\. During the autopsy [DNA will be taken](https://web.facebook.com/NewsfromtheMed/posts/1007249573061972?hc_location=ufi) and there will be an attempt to locate and inform their families\.

Until we reach equality in mobility, brave children like this will continue to die, and their deaths will remain on the European conscience\.
#### **Arrivals to Gran Canaria and route shifts**

[Media report that](https://www.20minutos.es/noticia/4347778/0/rescatan-una-patera-con-16-personas-a-unas-10-millas-de-gran-canaria/?fbclid=IwAR2lJiITgOphFo4_EJJ-hBBbcoM0d1RAR0bBYIfKCQ_Sim5uSItvTCeNRLw) approximately16 people have been rescued 10 miles off the coast of Gran Canaria\. Everyone appeared to be in good health\.

In 2020 there has been an [increase in arrivals to the Canary Islands by 454%](https://elforodeceuta.es/continua-caida-llegadas-personas-migrantes-ceuta-espana/) and a decrease in arrivals to Cueta and Mellila and to Spain in general\. Overall arrivals are down by 40%\. This is thought to be largely related to the Spanish Government’s deal with Morocco, known for its poor treatment of people on the move, which just last week resulted in [the death of a man from Cameroon](https://elforodeceuta.es/un-camerunes-muere-en-tanger-tras-una-redada-de-los-agentes-marroquies/) \.

A report on the Human Rights situation at Spain’s southern border \(in Spanish\) can be found [HERE](https://apdha.org/media/informe-frontera-sur-2020.pdf) \.
#### **Protest against confinement**

Around 50 people, [confined to the Albacete fairgrounds \(IFAB\) since July 20,](https://www.elsaltodiario.com/explotacion-laboral/temporeros-albacete-rompen-cuarentena-para-exigir-cambios-ante-mala-gestion-confinamiento) broke through the mandatory isolation fence on Wednesday to protest their continued confinement and conditions\. The general feeling was that they were being confined in order to separate them from the rest of the population and not to prevent them from possible contagion\.

After negotiation with local authorities, isolation will now take place in groups of up to 25 people in eight different locations and for a period of ten days\. If there are no new positives in those confinement units, they will be discharged\. The majority of people detained are temporary workers\.

NORTH MACEDONIA
#### **Returns to Greece**

Northern Macedonian police announced on Sunday that they found [a truck with 94 migrants](http://www.federalna.ba/bhs/vijest/329659/vozac-kamiona-odmah-pobjegao?fbclid=IwAR2mEqwEgLg-4-TxO49oDTe3sRtsKQko-zPHP1Pcla67tUrzYj_MKW6IKR4) from Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan and Syria\. The migrants will be placed in a camp in Gevgelija, from where they will be deported to Greece, reportedly their entry point to Europe and a country were the difficulties faced by people on the move are documented every day\.

SERBIA
#### Unaccompanied minors neglected

The Asylum Protection Service is [reporting](https://www.instagram.com/p/CDq_WYLDQBu/) on increasing numbers of unaccompanied minors in the Subotica region and along the Serbian/Hungarian border\. Kids who often have health problems are ignored by the competent social work centres and authorities\. Over the weekend they met a 16\-year\-old boy who was fighting for air and was unable to communicate or stand\. Volunteers called the competent emergency service and over the next half an hour they monitored and calmed the boy whose condition remained unchanged\. The boy was taken to the hospital\.

GERMANY
#### **Berlin and Thuringia to sue Seehofer?**

As we reported last week, Berlin initially wanted to take over [300 people](https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/brief-an-andreas-geisel-innenminister-seehofer-verbietet-berlin-aufnahme-von-fluechtlingen/26048558.html) from the camps on the Greek Aegean islands, Thuringia—a total of 500 by 2022, mainly unaccompanied minors, women travelling alone, pregnant women, single mothers with their children and elderly, seriously ill or traumatised people\.

[Media now report](https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/zwei-mal-nein-zur-fluechtlingsaufnahme-muss-seehofer-jetzt-mit-klagen-rechnen/26078320.html?fbclid=IwAR0o-UxbWhAdqm4DlGX_AX0ErRocTd39a5ByXTpcy7HYfi7t3MMOS9E2dgM) that both state governments have invoked the “Law on the Residence, Employment and Integration of Foreigners in the Federal Territory”, or Residence Act for short\. It states in Clause 23: ‘For reasons of international law or humanitarian law or in order to safeguard political interests of the Federal Republic of Germany, the Highest Land Authority may order that foreigners from certain states or otherwise certain groups of foreigners be granted a residence permit\.’

As a result they could legally challenge Seehofer’s right to deny the transfer of people from camps in Greece to Germany\.

FRANCE
#### Paris: volunteers needed on Tuesday, 11 August

Solidarite Migrants Wilson is [calling for volunteers](https://web.facebook.com/598228360377940/photos/a.599438026923640/1505353556332078) on Tuesday, 11 August, for meal prep and distribution to the hundreds of people still on the streets in northern Paris\. Read all the details at the link above\.

UK
#### **UK considering using Navy to prevent small boats**

Despite the fact that similar activities by other EU and international countries have been strongly condemned, Home Secretary Priti Patel is suggesting the Navy be deployed to the Channel to return boats\. This has been widely [decried by lawyers as illegal](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/07/uk-plan-to-use-navy-to-stop-migrant-crossings-is-unlawful-lawyers-warn?fbclid=IwAR1R9NBBmkGB2LZ0hb35_hcUjeTIsMsiVisDMSh1phB-el28KN8XTwXR9G0) , but this no longer puts politicians off a course of action as we well know\.

To carry out her plan she has employed [Dan O’Mahoney as a Clandestine Channel Threat Commander](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/home-secretary-appoints-small-boat-commander?fbclid=IwAR13EaVNU6oWugsCWUkN5TjKSvlCOqaKksyuUWvDFh9yKWkidN7UscCW6P0) \. According to the media, the French have asked for £ [30 million](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-migrants-france-pay-idUSKCN2540YZ?fbclid=IwAR1oVRrnSIEEeHrUxwA91DFdyf2XBme_ziO2lsWWWp7KQT3MyxJ04ccoCKA) to police the border\. How much would it cost to set up a viable asylum process which would not necessitate children climbing aboard dinghies to dodge ferries and cargo ships?
