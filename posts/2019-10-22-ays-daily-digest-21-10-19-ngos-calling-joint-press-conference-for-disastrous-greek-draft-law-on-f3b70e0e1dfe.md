### AYS Daily Digest 21/10/19 NGOs calling joint press conference for disastrous Greek Draft Law on International Protection

_EU susceptible to blackmail with EU\-Turkey Deal and Syrian invasion // lots of news from Samos // 104 people on Ocean Viking // Malta court ruled in favor of migrants for detention length // more human trafficking from Ivory Coast to Europe // evidence showing Croatian police illegally deporting people to BiH // and more…_
### Feature
#### Consider this your open invitation to the joint press conference on the Draft Law on International Protection, happening on Tuesday 29 October \(12:00\) at the Cultural Center of the Municipality of Athens\!

This proposed reform to the Greek asylum system, if passed into law, would have a detrimental impact on human rights of asylum seekers\.

[Amnesty International Greece](https://www.amnesty.gr/news/press/article/22598/prosklisi-se-koini-synenteyxi-typoy-gia-shedio-nomoy-peri-diethnoys?fbclid=IwAR2vNZXgVRoz3snXOswggNMG_zrpI5-m2WoPO_h25eq2Vpq86xumuLI5oTU) , one of the 6 NGOs calling the joint press conference, writes: _“ **The Draft Law was consulted for only 5 days** : this made it impossible to comment on the substance, and unfortunately demonstrated the pre\-emptive nature of the government’s consultation\.”_

[RSA](https://www.facebook.com/refucomm/posts/956650601353409?hc_location=uf) notes that: _“Among other things, the Draft Law restricts many provisions on the rights of applicants and beneficiaries of international protection to the minimum requirements laid down in Union law, despite the explicit possibility of adopting more favorable provisions in the context of the transposition of European Directives\. The organization concludes that the proposed provisions, if voted on, would **lead to the return of asylum seekers without procedural guarantees to unsafe third countries** \.”_

Here is also a [very helpful thread](https://twitter.com/Balkanizator/status/1186401049311141889?fbclid=IwAR0m1Cuo6ymrC566Ks--ZNG6zQWBTWV2O1PJ7m8xMxQMScorlVwDZsCokJs) covering one should check out:

### Syria

In their latest piece entitled, “War, Refoulement and Killing — End the EU\-Turkey Deal\!” Deportation Monitoring Aegean provides this poignant analysis: \( [read the whole piece here\)](https://dm-aegean.bordermonitoring.eu/2019/10/17/war-refoulement-and-killing-end-the-eu-turkey-deal/?fbclid=IwAR29DIX19Lr1FvUMrh6E8sz0gDaSwfna4B8MEijG28W3wI80Z8XC88ZCVPE)


> “Turkey has started a new war, invading North\-East Syria, arguing that they want to set up a “safe\-zone” and to “repatriate” three million Syrians\. Tens of thousands of people started fleeing this “safe zone” area, many died\. Even before this war, Syrians have been sweepingly deported from Turkey into war zones\. 





> This does not stop the EU continuing to deport migrants back to Turkey under the EU\-Turkey Deal, knowingly accepting refoulement and therefore the breach of international law and the death of people in war zones\. 





> While the Turkish state produces refugees, the EU refuses to stop paying the Turkish government to act as the EU’s door\-keeper\. This is not only inhumane but irrational: **the EU has made itself susceptible to blackmail through the EU\-Turkey Deal** \.” 




### Libya

There are some important questions to keep in mind regarding the financing of UNHCR’s endeavorment to evacuate refugees from Libya detention centres, to Rwanda\. Hopefully we can find answers\. [Here is a UNHCR press release](https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/briefing/2019/10/5da040054/second-life-saving-evacuation-vulnerable-refugees-libya-lands-rwanda.html) from a recent evacuation from October 11th\.


■■■■■■■■■■■■■■

> > Quick questions for UNHCR:
What is the budget for the Libya-Rwanda evacuation programme; what funds have been received so far; and where have they come from?

### Sea
#### A young woman remarked on the Ocean Viking: “It is easier to die at sea than to live in Libya\.”

[SOS MEDITERRANE](https://sosmediterranee.com/press/press-release-it-is-easier-to-drown-at-sea-than-to-live-in-libya-104-rescued-people-onboard-the-ocean-viking-in-need-of-a-place-of-safety-21102019/) reports in their press release the details of the rescue as well as interviews from the survivors on Libya:


> “On 18 October, two days after disembarking 176 rescued people in Taranto, Italy, the Ocean Viking, chartered by SOS MEDITERRANEE in partnership with Médecins Sans Frontières \(MSF\), rescued 104 people from a rubber boat in distress, 50NM off the Libyan coast\. **Amongst the rescued people are 40 minors, of which 30% are unaccompanied, and two pregnant women\.** The boat in distress was spotted by the SOS MEDITERRANNEE’s Search and Rescue team through binoculars\. 





> A 15\-year\-old Ivorian girl first tried crossing the Mediterranean in August with her mother and two younger siblings\. They were at sea for four days and saw two young children and two women die before being intercepted by the Libyan Coast Guard and taken back to Libya, where the whole family was sent to a detention centre\. **‘In there, they do whatever they want to the women,’** the girl told us\.” 





[In some good news,](https://www.abc.es/deportes/vela/otros-derroteros/abci-salvamento-maritimo-recibira-premio-aepn-durante-valencia-boat-show-201910211422_noticia.html) Salvamento Marítimo will receive the Spanish Association of Nautical Journalists annual prize on October 30th\. Always good to hear about sea rescue being recognized for the heroic act it is\!

81 people were rescued on Monday in the Alboran Sea\. There were 44 men, 23 women, 14 minors\. They are being transferred to Malaga\. Learn more [here](https://www.europapress.es/andalucia/malaga-00356/noticia-rescatan-81-personas-patera-mar-alboran-trasladan-puerto-malaga-20191021190834.html) \.

They had left on 16 October from Boujdour, Morocco, towards the Canary Islands, Spain…Today, finally, we received news that they were rescued by the Spanish search and rescue organisation Salvamento Maritimo to Spain, after at least 4 days at sea\!” 





[The Libyan Navy](http://en.alwasat.ly/news/libya/261448) is reporting how it rescued 148 people recently\. [Over 7,400](https://twitter.com/MarcoRotunno/status/1186264697403793408?fbclid=IwAR3lIC6uwrqrARHZdqlXcbyTonC5VqWroAbpFKP9MrzIh42OwqIb6lVNNrM) people were intercepted by the Libyan coastguard and returned to Libya so far this year\. There are over 45,000 people registered with UNHCR in Libya\. For more about recent Libyan stats, UNHCR’s info sheet is [here](https://twitter.com/MarcoRotunno/status/1186264697403793408?fbclid=IwAR3lIC6uwrqrARHZdqlXcbyTonC5VqWroAbpFKP9MrzIh42OwqIb6lVNNrM) \.
### Malta
#### A court has ruled that “the detention of migrants for more than 10 weeks on the basis of health laws was unlawful and the migrants should be released\.”

The application was filled by 6 asylum seekers who were detained at the Safi Barracks for 10 weeks longer than the legal limit\.

[Aditus](https://www.facebook.com/aditus.accessingrights/posts/2479762682104480?hc_location=ufi) explains for further developments:


> “Following these judicial pronouncements on Malta’s detention regime, we’ve asked Government to urgently meet us to discuss the future of all other asylum\-seekers illegally detained in Safi Barracks\. We are looking forward to Government’s invitation to meet with us\. The cases were brought by our lawyers and by lawyers from Jesuit Refugee Service Malta\.” 





On Sunday evening, people living in the Hal Far centre started a riot and set fire to five employees cars\. Some are saying that [the riot](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/20283/riots-at-migrant-center-in-malta?fbclid=IwAR1bBhM56K38U0dzlWlLPLKzAGTf8UQfzQd96-1iEWQphFYIUnU99bdKhm4) began after a few migrants were banned from entering the centre\. [On Monday](https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/watch-riot-police-raid-hal-far-migrant-centre-hours-after-major-riot.743712?fbclid=IwAR33MsFd97rH_dlz0fDEhWrYdrEaQMTn5wpOsEowHVv9vX1x9h8TI3RHgkk) , 50 policemen entered with riot gear and over a hundred people were arrested\. [Many factions](https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/98148/how_did_the_government_Opposition_agencies_and_unions_react_to_Sundays_riot?#.Xa6BWuhKg2x) are disappointed with the response of the police, considering the many people who had no involvment in the riot\.

**First:** While over 200 people arrived on Monday alone to the island of Samos, [700 people were transferred to the mainland\.](https://twitter.com/PHupfen/status/1186377245214105602?fbclid=IwAR2gIIBCjqQnQfvS5SB5go-6zwhs9PJn3kNI5iVN6_eAuzVkNgIv99RIDx4) Here is a video of over 400 waiting on the platform\. These people leave with uncertain futures awaiting them on the mainland\. Not nearly enough people are being transferred from the the island, where conditions are “life\-threatening”\. What needs to happen should involve:

**Second:** There was [a demonstration held by the local citizens](https://twitter.com/ElisaPerrigueur/status/1186273406737637376) of Samos on Monday\. They were trying to emphasize how they realise how unbearable the living in the camp must be and how it’s clearly affecting people outside of the camp\. This comes after the fire in the camp last week, when thousands of people had nowhere to stay besides of the streets of Vathy\. See the demonstration video below:

A new report details how Croatian police catch people migrating deep inside the country, then take them illegally to the BiH border\. The anoynomos sources says:

_“When we catch them, we take away their knives, which almost everyone has, cell phones and things like that\. We put that in bags, which they get back when they are released into the woods towards Bosnia and Herzegovina\. We give them everything back — money, cell phones and more, except for knives\. We throw away knives and items that serve injury”_ [Find out more here](https://www.telegram.hr/politika-kriminal/istupio-je-jos-jedan-policajac-koji-tvrdi-da-hrvatska-policija-po-naredbi-sefova-migrante-ilegalno-vraca-u-bih/?fbclid=IwAR1qEv1e0VHK8zrFSxUIgiXE-Qc_dr3pRbgs-QmhoetBRI54FN2DmdiN8no) _\._
