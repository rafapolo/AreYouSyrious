### Serbian activists and volunteer groups report a growing presence of children on the move\.

Info Park reports about an increase of unaccompanied boys in Belgrade, many of them under the age of 14\. All of the boys whom Info Park field teams encountered in the past week across the city’s parks came from Afghanistan and most of them spent many months on the road until they reached Serbia\. “According to their stories, they travel in larger groups, accompanied by men and other boys\. Throughout the whole journey they face various difficulties, including a high possibility of physical, emotional and sexual abuse, the risk of trafficking and related abuses, blackmailing or extortion from the smugglers and traffickers\. The majority of the boys identified by Info Park were interested in accommodation at a facility for unaccompanied children, so they were referred to outreach social workers\. All of them were provided with information on their rights and available services, legal possibilities in Serbia and asylum procedures in Serbia and other countries\.”

They also warn about the growing trend of people risking their lives under trucks and buses to try and cross the border, with several hundred people officially documented for having attempted to pass, but were prevented by the authorities\. Another worrying trend is the locals’ perception of the situation for people on the move in Serbia\. Info Park reports that an informal citizens’ group Movement for safe Sombor started a petition to move out people on the move from the private houses, hostels, hotels, train compartments, abandoned farmhouses, and village houses to the government\-run centers\. They claim that the aim of their petition is “to help migrants live in decent conditions and that town of Sombor should not host more migrants than the number of places in the reception center”\. So far, at least 2,700 citizens signed the petition\.
### SEARCH AND RESCUE AT SEA
### At least 23 people killed in a shipwreck off the coast of Tunisia

This terrible information was shared by the Tunisian branch of the Red Crescent\.

70people were saved in the incident\. 39 people who were on another boat that sank off the Tunisian coast near Sfax were also rescued by the local coast guard, the organisation reported\.

In Italy, the crew of the Aita Mari are having their exit permits to Burriana issued without having to wait for the end of the quarantine period\. The Salvamento Marítimo Humanitario vessel had removed 50 rescued persons in Augusta on May 17 and are now allowed to leave without further quarantine time for the crew\.
### EU

The EU Commission is having another opportunity to examine what has been taking place in the outer edges of the EU, along its longest land border, that of Croatia with Bosnia and Herzegovina and with Serbia\.

It seems that, in spite of all the hard evidence, reports \(those published and those that the officials have stopped from being published for now\) and the reality of the situation at the green border, along with no presence of the long\-discussed independent border monitoring system, Croatia is now entering the Schengen area, perhaps even conditioned with the actions it is now being under investigations for\.

At the same time, the Frontex missions along the external borders and in the sea are getting all the possible space, money and blind trust from the EU:

No Comment:
### GREECE

As the reactions to the issue of pushbacks don’t cease and Greece gets a pat on the back for putting the EU policy of securitisation into practice, other alarming perspectives come into light:

At the same time, the pressure directed at the NGOs and the media continues\. Some of the more bizarre examples include this:
### Vaccination begins

Vaccination in the government run camps is starting, as we announced earlier\. Reports say that voluntary participation rate is so far reaching only up to 20% of people\. “But officials say 30% of people are under 18 so not at high risk, another 20–30% already have immunity”\.

Some impressions on why it is so, from the other side, the people at the camp
### A helpline “by refugees for refugees”


> _In addition to providing psychosocial support, the team helps asylum seekers and refugees solve various problems they face, such as obtaining information about the health system, available social services, Greek language courses they can attend, how to obtain a national social security number \(AMKA\) and many other issues\._

### BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
### Solidarity links resulting in concrete support

Trieste’s Linea d’Ombra arrived to Una\-Sana canton with aid and support to the local team of NNK, joining them “during a particularly challenging week: constant evacuations have been happening in Bihać, while pressure on the borders is mounting in Bojna and Sturlic\. Our days have been intense and very, very full”, as they reported\.

### GERMANY

Searching through phones — unlawfully

In Germany, asylum seekers have sued the country for searching their cell phones during asylum applications\. It is something thousands of people face on a daily basis, by random officers across Europe, but as the regional judges in Germany have now ruled one such search unlawful, the impact could be far\-reaching\. BAMF also violated the law by unnecessarily storing the information obtained during the search, the presiding judge said\.

DENMARK

“Clearing out” from people is the idea?\!

As we have been reporting, the Danish political stance towards Syrians is getting harsh criticism from all sides, and also some indignation from the Syrian community\. Hundreds of Syrians have now [extended their sit\-in](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/2/syrian-refugees-protest-against-denmarks-attempt-to-return-them?fbclid=IwAR0QSU9pWm-KmDPzHdSDAA-kqyGNCsPk9LQr7ii028msaFBK0SRpwhRQDoE) demonstration in front of the Danish parliament into a third week, protesting [measures](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/20/denmark-what-may-happen-to-syrian-refugees-who-refuse-to-return) aimed at returning them to Syria\. At the same time, [a report](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsn4hr.org%2Fblog%2F2021%2F06%2F02%2F56281%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2Ll6ibgwJKk8TDVG4ZG2E8PtrMqHt_KNzs2ZK8i9y9OhTThGNqJBa2ihI&h=AT3pe8reEjCEiE3buaS7s2zPS-jl2-YdZi2QR1mv5RZ9k-VC7C7pGuSeKgPbV03-ErJ-cq4Ww1QMdMknE3e4WA4Nrx-OweuyKKgir2nc70e4jU2eS63iX0Vi0s-l0wzJB09o0KgjRLHyag&__tn__=R]-R&c[0]=AT1BsX3AaLxHXZ39rPyCgONvZranx-deyjCRE3y1iezuyKyfkIZpCgsf2deJ2WWyFDlBBE34zhULKGIYps9LkyvAUiE8UzMTZOS_88HYnsnwqjJNprK7iwxggYdcqB210onzi0O-W5D36dUBeHVbvc1Ta3QaB43izdMIFm27ufmJKYn1wjZkSrOj02nZ1suXJS4_sOHLujdOhDy3mQ) has documented 162 cases of arbitrary arrest documented and tens of thousands deprived of liberty for hours to force them to vote in May 2021\.

In Denmark, there is now a political majority in the parliament backing the proposal that allows for the establishment of reception centers for asylum seekers in other countries, the newspaper Jyllands\-Posten writes\.
Denmark’s Liberal Party has informed the media that they will vote for the bill that has been presented in the Folketing by the government\. The vote is expected to take place on Thursday\.

The idea behind the proposal is that asylum seekers are flown to reception centers in other countries while their applications are processed in Denmark\. Rwanda, Tunisia, and Egypt have been mentioned as possible countries for the establishment of the centers\.

The UN High Commissioner for Refugees \(UNHCR\) has asked the Folketing to reject the proposal\.

### WORTH READING
- This article contributes to the debates on de\-centring the analysis of migration governance in Europe by focusing on the potential role of the EU — find the article [**here**](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14650045.2021.1929183?fbclid=IwAR1VXnC_mcg0LjlLh8Pd52SFUVXcWxtnrdddYfBnQar1NL1x7qUQAqpwjqM&)
- There are two contrasting images of women migrants engaged in global migration: either victims suffering from sexual violence drowning in the Mediterranean, or brave, empowered heroines supporting their families\. Such images serve a range of political, humanitarian, and economic agendas, but what are their respective implications in global migration politics?
