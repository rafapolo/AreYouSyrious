“The current cross\-Channel migration crisis has two dimensions\. One is the real human anguish needing diplomatic and practical resolution\. The other is its exploitation in a shouting match for public and political consumption,” British [media highlight](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fcommentisfree%2F2021%2Fnov%2F29%2Fjohnson-insulting-france-channel-crossings%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR3B9770x0hchTSycDZGDczq1iTYlF9jPq5JMOdBe-6ovACbKcOvEHqcOT8&h=AT1-fmni8LkOAQrgtmClhwh8nkBfNACUTx8pJN2OMQIUwwcexMoMIvb2d4ffjKmEt5ndyKUuVGLuTaeZhgUA9x-0pIOhQxQNDiPhWaupAHrTP2QFSUrGe8-xcww8kuI8og&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT3WH38MuArd9Q2entysrIuwGG9GCj-AY-r6vrgZ7OhnRwBLJEM4cYZbIGhwJbQMDFlehHLqnc052ao-dR4_C5KkoHwaloMzimm1cTZMgZppt6TRNu-ZVce0GOMuoOJ7iezFEO1Dcz0w_503dAdFrHCmlSU7_7cHeQLPYCGESbFFQ-B5rF7qmjbP1tM2Fbp7L_icWtau3iVYrW7mv1o) , noting how what is taking place, particularly the British\-French dispute, is proving exactly the opposite of what the PM Johnson said ahead of Brexit, that it will allow him to “take back control” of immigration\. Instead, they now seem to be avoiding any [documented fail](https://twitter.com/jamesfraney/status/1465187086198267916?s=20) to be responsible in those matters\. See a comment piece in the “worth reading” section\.

Stressing better cooperation from countries of origin on readmission, securitisation in the context of Schengen, and the further use of Frontex, the presented plan of a better “cooperation in migration matters”, and common work “against smuggling networks”, once again proves that the EU Member states’ prime idea is to stop the move of the people, not to protect lives, nor provide safe passage for those wishing to express the intention to seek asylum in other places, as is their right\.


> They are convinced of the need to strengthen operational cooperation between them, not only on the Channel and on North Sea coasts but further upstream in Europe and in the countries of origin and transit, and that improving the joint cooperation with the United Kingdom is also essential\. 




- Available as [**a PDF**](https://www.statewatch.org/media/2960/joint-statement-english-channel-migration-28-11-21.pdf) is the Joint statement of the Federal Republic of Germany, the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the French Republic on migration issues and police and judicial cooperation in the Channel and the North Sea


In the light of recent discussions regarding the responsibilities over lost lives in the Channel, the essential element seems to be committed — people and their life stories\.

#### SEA
### Saved lives at sea

The Italian coast guard rescued nearly 250 migrants, including a newborn baby, from a fishing boat drifting a few miles off the Calabrian coast at the weekend\. The rescue operation was complicated by rough weather conditions, InfoMigrants [reported](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.infomigrants.net%2Fen%2Fpost%2F36845%2F244-migrants-rescued-off-calabria-coast%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR3Y4eozk0CDmk4QXsdmiySiTPlVgZkK19o4-iLAPcVHmYims6fOg1Np-EI&h=AT0fKV9HAi6Q0b3Nftw-ybPViwbXy8WAervWb7H6bZDlc-8snnNjy6Pjdl9PnLLNqqUzkW7K1M2-L2_nDVWN61tH0UN4qETa4-pvhq0eaHr6w7Gusr-lZCm8uvYv_dr-mQNPnMjqEebObg&__tn__=R]-R&c[0]=AT0gHFHgWaqjMsCaJRzKrg0zOH6OthTH9NP_LlhNfI07yPQCY8iqqsPsxlXPI-dmVs19LbnFjcAGTby-zMcVTjl03y3f-kUH2eeMikjd1bWISSP_f-mOz1z_hCyWN8F2IB0RAfRF_7QTJW5fTigzfvprE_2J2i1CvnAGUq1FvR7-p_bSahlDWEohroe_8syuTXhBiSJaoOipFTcAaGbSTAPcBpDuEgA) \.

The rescue was carried out overnight on Saturday and Sunday and lasted more than 16 hours due to difficult weather and sea conditions, the Italian coast guard said in a statement\.
#### GREECE

As a response to the recent decision on changing the asylum registration that we reported about, MIT issued a press release —


> The Skype system, which had been running for seven years, had immense delays of up to 14 months as evidenced in Mobile Info Team Lives on Hold report\. These delays forced people to live undocumented and destitute for prolonged periods\. 





> The new system, effective immediately, will force all people who enter Greece via the land border to go to two undisclosed, but already existing facilities, one in Northern Greece and one in Southern Greece, to register their asylum claim whilst being detained\.

#### FRANCE
### The largest solidarity salon in Paris this Sunday

17 hairdressers and barbers from the Wilson Barbers team came to do hair for the residents of the house la Maison des Refugies and the passersby\.

[Here is a video](https://fb.watch/9BT9vJOqRr/) of the lovely afternoon

Nearly 100 people have been able to get their hair done, braided, a small wellness bracket in a not always easy everyday life\.

Here is an illustrated reminder of the fact the need to flee hardships has throughout recent history led people to board boats and go towards better places:

#### GENERAL

A researcher Thomas Lacroix [highlights](https://theconversation.com/migrants-plus-de-10-millions-de-francais-vivent-dans-une-commune-accueillante-170496) municipalities that, within their means and competences, are implementing policies to improve the living conditions of people on the move —


> The events at the Belarusian border illustrate once again how the agenda of European states on migration remains guided by security considerations\. Against the current of national policies, municipalities are trying, to the extent of their means and skills, to develop an alternative approach to migration\. 





> In September 2021, 73 mayors from around the world, from Marseille to Los Angeles, from Freetown to Mannheim, signed a joint declaration affirming that their cities would stand ready to welcome Afghan refugees\. On 21 October, the Global Parliament of Mayors met in Palermo to discuss climate migration\. These recent events reflect a global trend\.
