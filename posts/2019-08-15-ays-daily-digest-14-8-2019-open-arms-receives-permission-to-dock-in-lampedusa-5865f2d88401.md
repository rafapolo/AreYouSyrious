#### **FEATURED**

Open Arms finally has a safe port to dock and disembark the 147 people trapped on board for 13 days\!

Today the TAR \(Regional Administrative Court\) of Lazio has [suspended the infamous Decreto Sicurezza Bis](https://www.internazionale.it/bloc-notes/annalisa-camilli/2019/08/14/open-arms-tar-sospende-decreto-sicurezza-bis?fbclid=IwAR1vPbCxVOIzlV7l6aaDyyWk2zYMYBeT8djWItbPBj4Gvx7ePGNCYnKUByY) , allowing the boat to enter Italian waters and head toward Lampedusa \(in the morning, the boat has reached the island, but is still waiting to dock\) \.

The NGO had appealed to the very same court yesterday against the decision taken by Salvini \(Ministry of Interior\), Trenta \(Ministry of Defense\) and Toninelli \(Ministry of Transports\) to impede the entry into territorial waters\.

The decision taken by the Court cites the “exceptional urgency and seriousness” of the case, due to the “prolonged stay offshore of the boat”, lifting the ban to facilitate the assistance of the people on board\.

Among the 147 people, 31 are minors\. Few days ago, also the Juvenile Court had expressed the need to safeguard the wellbeing of the children onboard\.

The decision of the TAR underlines that the Decreto Sicurezza Bis violates international laws regarding SAR operations and the law of the sea, therefore it ruled in favour of the entry into territorial waters, suspending sanctions and the seizure of the vessel\.

Nevertheless, even though the boat received the permission to sail to Lampedusa, it is still unclear whether they will be able to disembark the people quickly\.

This decision could represent a positive example to follow for Ocean Viking, which is still struggling to take care of the 356 people on board, with deteriorating weather conditions and no safe port on the horizon\.

But to offset the good news coming from the Mediterranean, are other situations that are worrying, as [Greece expressed its concern](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/18819/migration-greece-wants-eu-to-share-the-burden?fbclid=IwAR18rXm-of4RIWCgNoI2TljN6sQUowCcqcGW07wPS69m_gpqcMn1CsJ2bFw) over the increased number of arrivals to the Aegean islands in the past weeks\.


> \[…\] since July 7, “there has not been a single day without arrivals\.” 





There are approximately 20,000 people stranded on Greek islands to the current day, thanks also to the opening of a new corridor “between the Greek island of Samothraki and Alexandroupoli in the north, near the Turkish border”\.

Giorgos Koumoutsako, alternate minister for citizens’ protection, calls the EU authorities for a fairer division of the number of arrivals “on the basis of concrete solidarity”\.

If you have any further information on NGOs opening times during the month, please get in touch with the above mentioned groups\.

Mobile Info Team has published a [series of information](https://www.facebook.com/mobileinfoteam/posts/2506179562944091?hc_location=ufi) on possible actions to be taken if you have been rejected for asylum in Greece and want to appeal the decision\.

Also in [Athens Volunteers Information and Coordination Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/AthensVolunteersInformation/?epa=SEARCH_BOX) , you can find useful information if you need to appeal during holiday season in August\.


> TIME FRAMES TO APPEAL NEGATIVE ASYLUM TO COURT \(2ND DECISION\) OVER AUGUST HOLIDAY PERIOD 





> Please note that in all administrative procedures \(not penal or civil\) the month of August does not count in the deadline\. 





> Where the courts are closed over the holiday period, the number of days therefore start counting again on the day the courts re\-open\. 





> Refugees still need to see a lawyer/legal team with their documents and the decision to confirm whether or not they fall into this category \(i\.e\. of August not counting\) \. Each case is different and should be examined on its own merits\. 





Warning for [weather conditions](https://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2019/08/14/greece-weather-aug-15-16/) has been issued for mainly **_Northern Greece_** \. Rain, storms, hail and powerful winds are to be expected on 15–16 August\.

Engineers installed a portable wifi router in **_Vučjak_** , **_Bosnia and Herzegovina_** , today\.


> Thanks to good friends who recognize the value of being connected, an engineer from Ericson and the Red Cross in Bihać, we installed the first portable wifi router at the refugee camp in Vučjak\. The need for internet in crisis situations is a major need so people can be in touch with their loved ones\. We sincerely hope this router will serve the refugees while they are in this camp — which we hope will not be a long time because the conditions in Vučjak are getting worse\. We hope that we at least brought some moments of joy to the people living in these conditions\.

Meanwhile, if there is good news coming from the horrible camp at Vučjak, we can not say the same for other areas of BH, in particular **_Ključ_** , where people are still transiting with no support at all, except that of tireless locals\.

Tonight, around 50 people arrived and spent the night sleeping rough in cold and wet weather\. Of this 50 people, 18 of them are minors\.

UNHCR in Tripoli is allegedly offering money to people they can not resettle, to find alternative solutions \(namely, the street\) \. Among them, many survivors of the Tajoura detention centre bombing\. If they don’t receive support from UNHCR, they will likely [be arrested or taken by smugglers](https://twitter.com/sallyhayd/status/1161561630976696321?fbclid=IwAR1eUx9j3J1OIezLNLEvxrVu_rWRIrhuQ63mP2c_HIS_LaFqM8Oi0zxgWOo) \.

Meanwhile, the 36 people \(21 men, 11 women, four children\) who were stranded at the border between Tunisia and Libya since Sunday 4 August, are now apparently [safe in Tunisia and receiving assistance](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/18823/ivorian-migrants-stranded-at-libya-border-safe-iom-says?ref=tw&fbclid=IwAR2yOVJq8OZ_Lv0KxyCy1QDJIbj5_4K2RlhqVvf3RISZETIdi_Q6ttNLZ5w) \.
#### GERMANY

According to the Court of Munich, [“readmissions” to Greece at the German\-Austrian border are illegal](https://www.equal-rights.org/post/decision-of-court-of-munich-refusals-at-the-border-are-illegal-and-thus-the-seehofer-deal?fbclid=IwAR2BBkUv1nNaLjv2dXOqXAL3YmnSWKNAf8rF8ouIlY6rD0n7MNZyRRe7dcg) , and so is the “Seehofer Deal” with Greece and Spain\.

The legal case was begun in specific when an Afghan citizen crossed this border by train in May and, when checked by police, it was found that the man had been fingerprinted in Greece, therefore eligible for return, according to a “Pre\-Dublin procedure”\.


> The Federal Police did not carry out any further examination\. Nor did a hearing in the proper sense took place\. In its action, the Federal Police referred solely to the German\-Greek Arrangement and sent only a “Notification of refusal of entry” to Greece\. 





After the man was deported on the same day \(and imprisoned in Greece immediately after his arrival\), a legal file was opened on the case\.

Today the Court of Munich ruled that the man has to be brought back to Germany \(at Germany’s expenses\) and granted temporary entry to the country, citing as one of the major reason, the interruption of the man’s asylum procedure in Greece after his return\.

On Dublin III, the judge said:


> “Moreover, the Court has considerable doubts as to the legality and existence of a so\-called “pre\-Dublin procedure”\. By assuming a so\-called “pre\-Dublin procedure” in the case of an applicant actually staying in the territory of a Member State, the subjective procedural rights of the applicants under the Dublin III Regulation and its objective could be bypassed\. This clarifies, that even in a “refusal of entry” situation, in order to transfer an applicant from Germany to Greece, a Dublin procedure \(take back request — acceptance — possibility for legal remedies with suspensive effect\) needs to be carried out\. As part of this procedure, it is necessary to examine potential human rights violations in Greece, which could lead to a responsibility of Germany for the asylum procedure according to Art\. 3 para 2 or Art\. 17 para 1 Dublin III Regulation, which was not done by the acting authorities\. 




#### DENMARK

Changed signals from the new Social Democrat government after statement from the Minister of Integration, Mattias Tesfaye, today concerning the UN quota refugees\.

Counter to his previous statements before parliament, Tesfaye now — in accordance with the so\-called “shift of paradigm”, adopted by the previous center\-right wing government — claims that government policy is that quota refugees will be able to obtain a temporary residence permit only, and that this will be subject to possible withdrawal as is the case for all other refugees\.

The minister intends to order the Immigration Service that when assessing the need for protection in Denmark, quota refugees must be assessed on a par with all other refugees\.

The new position is expected to raise disagreement with the political parties supporting the minority government, as it is seen to oppose the recent agreement that made the new government a reality\.
