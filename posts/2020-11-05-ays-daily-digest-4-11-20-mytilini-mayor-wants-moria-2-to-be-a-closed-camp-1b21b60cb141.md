### FEATURE: Mayor of Mytilini wants to make Moria\.2 a closed camp

**LESVOS** — [Local media](https://www.lesvosnews.net/articles/news-categories/ygeia/aitima-gia-pliri-apokleismo-toy-kyt-ston-kara-tepe-ayxisi-diasporas) reported on the Mayor of Mytilini’s meeting on Tuesday and gathered the following: “The purpose of the meeting was to assess in its true magnitude the situation with the coronavirus, as it has been formulated at the Municipality of Mytilene over the last 24 hours and for this reason the following was decided:
1. EODY was immediately asked to provide the competent Committee of the Municipality of Mytilene with the exact results of the tests and the positive cases, even from the private laboratories, always respecting medical confidentiality\.
2. Expansion of the Commission’s tracking team \(up to seven people\), in order to effectively trace the contacts of positive cases\.
3. **The Ministry of Immigration and Asylum will request for the complete and effective control of the immigrants in the temporary KYT in Kara Tepe\.**
4. The Commission, with the participation of competent bodies, will meet at regular intervals, in order to take the necessary decisions, as the situation develops\.”


[Dunya Collective](https://twitter.com/DunyaCollective/status/1324016158429925377?fbclid=IwAR2w-tq2rR5qRcRkeeiIjQlI5QUDU-Nj9rnQu9H2UeQUpnBTYTVEnZTXj3c) and others are viewing this as a municipality wanting to “lockdown” the camp\. [Leave No One Behind](https://enoughisenough14.org/2020/11/04/lesvos-mytilini-mayor-kyteli-wants-to-close-moria2-completely/) elaborates:


> “As a result, inhabitants will no longer be allowed to move in and out under any circumstance but urgent medical need\. Covid should not be used as a tool to discriminate against people seeking protection\. Already now the camp is locked completely on Sundays\. No one can exit, no one can enter\. Human rights workers stand behind locked doors\.” 





In an update from [UNHCR](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/documents/details/82668?fbclid=IwAR3cIfYM3-Uoo1ZkuwkLKh7IF74N8uzHDDuouMlTUnjoDIOg2ML1ixo4dV0) about Moria\.2, they said “The groundwork was completed for the installation of 46 bucket showers provided by IOM\. \* An
additional 152 IOM bucket showers will be available soon and are expected to be installed in the coming weeks\. This is a temporary solution as the site is not connected to a water supply system\. In the longer\-term, more WASH facilities suitable for the winter season will be needed to cover the hygiene needs of the entire camp population\.”

Cold water is finally coming in “buckets” to the people who have been without for almost [two months](https://twitter.com/DunyaCollective/status/1323994299915259904?fbclid=IwAR1YEJXtNOQUR_BSDNC547WFI6hBs_UZVA0v_5nn9p1Ud6Ogc7Ihi3oVsU8) since the Moria fire…

### “Samos was raised by 18–25 cm after the earthquake”

**SAMOS** — According to reports by [Samos24](https://www.samos24.gr/%ce%ba%ce%b1%cf%84%ce%ac-18-25-%ce%b5%ce%ba%ce%b1%cf%84%ce%bf%cf%83%cf%84%ce%ac-%ce%b1%ce%bd%cf%85%cf%88%cf%8e%ce%b8%ce%b7%ce%ba%ce%b5-%ce%b7-%cf%83%ce%ac%ce%bc%ce%bf%cf%82-%ce%bc%ce%b5%cf%84%ce%ac/) “ _Impressive elevation of Samos by 18–25 cm was observed after a strong seismic tremor of 6\.7 on the Richter scale that occurred on Friday, 30 October at 13:51, focusing on the sea area 16 km northwest of the island…The research continues and a more complete report will soon be published in the Newsletter of Environmental, Disaster, and Crises Management Strategies, of the Postgraduate Program “Environmental, Disaster & Crisis Management Strategies” of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens\._ ”

[Samos Chronic](https://samoschronicles.wordpress.com/2020/11/04/plague-earthquakes-and-fire-what-next-for-samos/?fbclid=IwAR3flWK9TgsVl5unZ-anY8V38fQMoYdkSZwAARboEf3qLkvkK7RwwpM5r2g) les elaborated that everyone is in a state of shock and the after shocks aren’t helping\. There have already been over 240 of them and some measure 5 on the Richter scale\. Even though most measure 3 or 4, they are still frightening\. In regards to those in Vathy’s camp:


> “Although the earthquake has brought out an immense sense of solidarity as people care for one another in so many ways, it does not feel as though this solidarity embraces the refugees here\. It is rare to find any expressions of sympathy for those who were not only frightened by the quake but then 36 hours later faced a terrifying fire\. There have been no grassroots\-support initiatives created for the refugees who lost everything in fire comparable to those for the quake victims\. The hotel accommodation secured by the municipality is not open to the fire victims\. We are \(thankfully\) witnessing a rapid mobilisation of resources to support those made homeless by the quake, including the relocation to Vathi of empty accommodation cabins from the new, yet\-to\-open refugee camp near Mytlini\. All of this is in stark contrast to the experiences of the refugees both in terms of the speed and extent of the assistance provided\. The Jungle has endured two major fires this year, destroying the homes and possessions of hundreds of people and in neither case did we see such a speedy mobilisation of essential resources\.” 





**LESVOS** — Update from [Lesvos Solidarity — Pikpa](https://www.facebook.com/pikpalesvos/posts/2800221866919893) :


> “We will continue to play our role even stronger to fight for human rights and dignified living conditions in Lesvos, one of Europe’s borders where people’s freedom has been constrained, where some children don’t have access to education, where people escaping from war are forced to stay in a former shooting range in summer tents\. Pikpa has shown for the last eight years that a model based in solidarity can work if people join forces towards a common idea of respect and mutual support\. 





> We believe that in these dark times for European policies pertaining to asylum seekers and human rights, the “Pikpa way” is more relevant than ever\. We were evicted because under these policies solidarity is criminalized all around the continent\. We will continue fighting for a world in which the children that were evicted from their homes last Friday can grow while playing, without fear; where families separated by war can be reunited; where people escaping from torture don’t need to be retraumatized in concentration camps in order to achieve their right for asylum\. 





> The time to act is now\. No more evictions\. No more discriminatory policies\. No more criminalization of solidarity\.”

**CHIOS** — Update from [Solidarity in Chios](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1508309029486384/permalink/2706539509663324/) :


> “ **The new suicide attempt in Amygdaleza prison was made by a young Congolese woman, who was raped by a Greek citizen in Chios last summer** , and whose case we published on 14 August 2020 in our article entitled: COMPLAINTS ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND RAPE IN AMYGDALEZA\. The woman then went repeatedly to the General Hospital of Chios, first to the emergency room with bleeding and then to scheduled appointments \(we have the relevant documents available\) and finally left the island, no longer able to endure the fear and trauma\. The tragic thing is that at the moment she is being held in Amygdaleza to be sent back to the island due to a decision about traffic restrictions in Chios\! ” 





**KOS** — Update from [Global Roots](https://www.facebook.com/GlocalRoots/posts/1852167548279743) :


> “Despite the chaos of the past few days, **we are happy to share some positive news with you today\!** We are very excited to announce that we are opening a new safe space for refugee women and their babies on the island of Kos\. Our start\-up team arrived on the island in early October and they have been busy preparing the space\. We plan to open in early 2021, and will keep you updated on all developments\. But for now, here are some snapshots of our progress so far\!” 





**ATHENS** — Update from Khora Kitchen \(donate [here](https://www.facebook.com/KhoraAthens/posts/1610205599152042) \):


> “‘In Greece whether someone is unregistered in the asylum process or recognized as a refugee, they do not have enough support and people are going hungry\. That’s why the Khora kitchen is so important\.’ Everyone is welcome for free food at Khora Kitchen\.” 





**HEALTH AND COVID** — [First](https://www.facebook.com/apostolos.veizis/posts/10224754628313991) , it appears that Chalkida Hospital is using different rules for patients from Oinofyta and Ritsona refugee camps and for the local Greek populations\. They refuse to see any refugees without them taking a COVID 19 negative rapid test, but they don’t need the local population to do so\. Reports have been filed to the Ombudsman, Ministry of Migration and Asylum , Ministry of Health\.

[Second](https://www.facebook.com/apostolos.veizis/posts/10224754684995408) , there is reporting that there are no doctors currently at Grevena, Katsika, Lavrio, Vaiochori, Veria, Volvi, Pyrgos camps and Chios RIC\. How is this possible during the middle of a pandemic?

### 52 people accuse the Maltese authorities of breach of rights

According to the Times of Malta “ _The asylum seekers have filed constitutional proceedings against the Maltese authorities, calling for an effective remedy for the alleged breach of rights they suffered in a pushback to Libya last April\. The fifty applicants, together with two siblings of two other migrants who died in the operation coordinated by Malta, are claiming that it was the state’s failure to observe international, European and local laws which resulted in the migrants suffering inhuman and degrading treatment_ \.” More [here](https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/migrants-demand-payment-of-damages-after-pushback-to-libya.829552?fbclid=IwAR01hL7cujmsjenn29aUsmqqfAmov0fEUZN3SDhwXGz73uRsCWM-7I35N3c) \.

### Eight organizations in Calais are taking legal action against the “flagrance” procedure

**CALAIS** — In reporting on Street Press, the “flagrance” procedure is the basis for how police are evicting the slums of Calais\. The problem is that in the procedure there is no process for appeal\.


> “On 29 September 2020, at six in the morning, nearly 800 people were evicted by the police from a slum nicknamed Hospital Jungle, located in the area of ​​the moor of Virval\. Gendarmes, CRS , national police and border police that day executed an order to “shelter” the exiles\. 





> Eight migrant aid associations \(L’Auberge des Migrants, Cabane Juridique, Fondation Abbé Pierre, Help Refugees, Project Place, Salam, Secours Catholique and Utopia 56\) and 11 exiled people, represented by lawyer Eve Thieffry, contest the legality of the procedure\. On 27 October, they assigned the Pas\-de\-Calais prefecture for assault\.”

#### UK
### High Court rules: Unaccompanied minors cannot be housed alone in adult hotels

According to the Guardian: “ _The high court has ruled that unaccompanied child migrants cannot be placed in adult hotel accommodation after three young asylum seekers won the right to be placed in the care of social services in the first case of its kind\. The three, who cannot be identified, say they are 17 years old\. They arrived in the UK in July and August 2020\. Hillingdon council in west London has accepted that an age assessment for all three is required\. However, while current rules state that asylum seekers who have such assessments must be treated as children, the council argued that they should be placed in a hotel along with more than 400 adult asylum seekers_ \.” More [here](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/nov/02/lone-child-migrants-cannot-be-put-in-adult-hotels-high-court-rules?fbclid=IwAR3mN5HYd_9QTGqtj9LbKJIkkMXXPSHlJgZ75bB1E0nNGIDmmr9VnhwtbdQ) \.
### Government votes down effort to reunite children refugees with family in the UK

This is the second time the government has failed this initiative after the UK leaves the EU’s immigration rules on 31 December\. This time the margin was 333 to 264 votes\. Lord Dubs told the Independent that this was “very disappointing” and “It’s going to come back to the House of Lords and we will have to see what we can do…It is under discussion as we speak\.” More [here](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/child-refugee-migrants-dubs-amendment-immigration-bill-b1595914.html#Echobox=1604517786-migrants-dubs-amendment-immigration-bill-b1595914.htm) \.

Discover Society reports on the first UK migrant camps in Penally \(the Welsh government stands opposed\):


> “Enclosed within chained\-linked fencing topped with barbed wire, the UK government has created its first ‘migrant camps’ at two former army facilities; one is a training camp in Wales, the other is Napier Barracks near Folkestone in Kent\. The move has caused waves of local tensions as well as serious health and legal concerns since the middle of September\. 





> The camp in Penally is reportedly expected to hold around 230 asylum seekers, all males aged between 18 and 35, and while this number is tiny by international comparisons, the facility is tiny too, and in proximity to a local village that’s also tiny, with a population of slightly over 800, many said to be retired\.”
