#### FEATURE: Moria, the Aftermath

Two days after the fire that destroyed Moria, people are still trying to salvage what they can out of the wreckage and find a place to stay\. Another fire started in the night [near Kara Tepe camp](https://www.facebook.com/MoriaWhiteHelmets/posts/184390186537382) , although there is no word yet on the extent of its damage\.

The Greek government is [blaming people on the move](https://twitter.com/lk2015r/status/1303992300754726913?fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) for starting the fire in a press release that was sent out before an official investigation was finished\. In fact, the government press release is directly contradicted by the Public Order Minister, who says [there is no evidence](https://twitter.com/dgatopoulos/status/1303792429221511170?fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) that the fire was started on purpose\. The government’s racist narrative that people on the move started the fire only enables fascists [to continue their street violence](https://www.news247.gr/koinonia/akrodexies-peripolies-xana-gyro-apo-ti-moria.7851920.html?fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) and is [a cynical ploy](https://twitter.com/VassilisTsarnas/status/1304124837661736962?fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) to push the plan of building more detention centers\.

As more details about the fire come out, we are reminded again that this is a disaster that could have been prevented easily\. For years people have been warning that the unsafe conditions in Moria could cause a disaster such as a fire\. There were deadly fires in the camp before, [as recently as March](https://solomonmag.com/on-the-move/the-time-bomb-exploded-at-greeces-largest-refugee-camp/?fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) , but nothing was done about the overcrowding or unsafe living conditions\. Regardless of who sparked this latest blaze, the conditions were created by the negligence of the Greek government and the EU, which makes the insistence that it is the fault of people on the move even more appalling\.

The government is also still pushing the narrative that there were no casualties or serious injuries, even though witnesses report [at least two deaths](https://euobserver.com/migration/149385?fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) \. Why are injured people being blocked from treatment at the hospital, and why hasn’t there been a full investigation to find out how many were killed?

Right now, [about 12,000 people](https://www.facebook.com/refocusmedialabs/posts/3022323694664506) on the move are still forced to sleep rough on the roads and [even cemeteries](https://greece.greekreporter.com/2020/09/10/destitute-migrants-sleep-rough-at-local-cemetery-after-fire-at-greek-migrant-camp/) surrounding Moria, two days after the fire, with no access to bathrooms or other sanitary facilities\. Some are saying the situation is “ [worse than 2015\.](https://www.stonisi.gr/post/11309/xeirotera-ki-apo-to-2015-pics?fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) ” They are vulnerable to hostile actions by some locals\. A group prevented a team from Medicins Sans Frontieres from accessing [their medical facility](https://twitter.com/MSF_Sea/status/1303984049900392449?fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) inside the camp and some people also [blocked construction equipment](https://twitter.com/imlavin/status/1303968094130515968?fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) from entering or exiting the camp\. Fascist vigilantes are also attacking people on the move—they attacked one group that included several children [near Panagiouda](https://www.facebook.com/MoriaWhiteHelmets/posts/184388499870884) \.

Aid from the government and international organizations is slow\. [Water distributions](https://www.facebook.com/282059189113208/videos/948058022354947/) were eventually done in a chaotic, not socially distanced manner and businesses such as [the local Lidl](https://twitter.com/DunyaCollective/status/1303981974512635904?fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) helped pick up the slack\. [Some food distributions](https://twitter.com/daphnetoli/status/1304109688179523585?fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) also took place, however many people including young children went without food [for several days](https://twitter.com/daphnetoli/status/1304014065489121282?fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) \. International organizations like IOM have been [promoting their role on social media](https://twitter.com/IOMGREECE/status/1303934634187722752?fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) , but people on the ground have reported that their absence is conspicuous\. The [Greek government announced](https://twitter.com/g_christides/status/1304119669276766209?fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) that food, water, tents, and sanitation materials will be distributed, but so far these distributions have been sporadic at best\. However, there has been a steady supply of [riot police](https://twitter.com/katymfallon/status/1304144937924153344?fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) coming to Lesvos from Athens, because tear gassing children is more important than housing them\. Police are not helping but instead are blocking NGOs [from distributing aid](https://www.facebook.com/pawelcezary.kolodziej.9/posts/354413142609907) \.

There is no concrete plan for providing people with permanent housing or evacuating them\. A Greek government spokesperson said that only [unaccompanied children](https://www.ekathimerini.com/256792/article/ekathimerini/news/only-unaccompanied-children-will-leave-lesvos-says-govt-spokesman?fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) will be evacuated from Lesvos to the mainland, even though thousands more need shelter\. In the same speech, he also said that “some people do not respect the country that is hosting them\.” What, exactly, are people on the move supposed to respect? The fascist vigilantes threatening them in the streets? The police tear gassing them? The government, that did not do anything to stop the spread of a deadly pandemic and left them languishing in an overcrowded camp for years on end?

Throughout this, the EU has mounted a sporadic response that is not up to the problem at hand\. Some European countries have agreed to take in asylum seekers from Moria\. The Dutch government offered to take in [100 people](https://www.barrons.com/amp/news/dutch-offer-to-take-100-moria-fire-migrants-government-01599758705) , mostly minors, but only [after extended pressure](https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2020/09/pressure-mounts-on-minister-over-greek-island-refugees-following-fire/?fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) on the governing coalition and is a pathetically low number for such a wealthy country\. The German response is still hamstrung by a political divide—Interior Minister Seehofer does not want to take in people from Moria until an EU\-wide distribution mechanism is agreed on, despite pressure from [Members of Parliament](https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/moria-unionsabgeordnete-fordern-nach-brand-aufnahme-von-5000-fluechtlingen-a-8ff654fe-6d58-478e-8849-d92912e90b8a?fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) [and advocacy groups](https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/moria-brand-109.html?fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) \. However, the closest thing to an EU\-wide resettlement agreement was the decision by several EU countries to accept a grand total of — [400 unaccompanied minors from Moria\.](https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/nach-brand-in-moria-initiative-zur-aufnahme-von.1939.de.html?drn:news_id=1171455) Several countries, [including Austria](https://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2020-09/moria-oesterreich-niederlande-aufnahme-fluechtlinge?fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) , have outright rejected any plan to redistribute asylum seekers across Europe\. The Foreign Minister went as far as calling the debate “too emotional,” because the proper response to thousands of people rendered homeless overnight should be one of cool, rational detachment apparently\.

As our friend Eric from Latitude Adjustment Podcast points out, Europe [absolutely has the capacity](https://www.facebook.com/latitudeadjustmentpodcast/posts/706840843248256) to take in more people\. It has half a billion people across the continent, the economic capacity to provide a social safety net, and plenty of unused structures that can be turned into housing\. It just chooses not to do more\. He is not alone in this sentiment—people [from Germany](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/27190/thousands-of-protesters-call-on-germany-to-take-in-moria-refugees?fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) to [Thessaloniki](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1304040881272520704?fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) are urging their governments and the EU to do more and showing solidarity with those stuck in the hell that is Moria\.

The fire at Moria was a tragedy that has left countless people unhoused and even more vulnerable to violence than before, but it is not an anomaly\. Moria is characteristic of the rot that is at the center of EU border policy, a rot that does not care how many people die in the name of border security, whether they perish at sea or in overcrowded camps\.

Europe Must Act made a masterpost of organizations that need donations [here](https://www.facebook.com/europemustact/posts/172314817714554) \.
#### GREECE

Even as Moria smolders, cruelty and forced returns elsewhere in Greece continues\. Aegean Boat Report [reported](https://twitter.com/ABoatReport/status/1304122324149559297?fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) that a group of people who arrived on Samos on Wednesday were pushed back to Turkey\.

Finally, some good news\! Hamza and Mohamed, two people wrongfully [accused of smuggling](ays-daily-digest-1-9-20-freedom-for-hamza-and-mohamed-ed3414d23867) , were [released from prison](https://twitter.com/BorderlineEurop/status/1304098590982377475) on Thursday\!
#### BALKANS

The University of Gottingen interviewed over 500 people on the move that crossed the Balkan route between 2013 and 2018\. The report showed that with increased border surveillance and control, there was also increased risk of life\-threatening conditions\. It also challenged the idea of what we call the 2015 “refugee crisis”: for many people on the move, it was not a crisis but a rare window of opportunity where crossings were relatively safer and there was more public goodwill\. You can read the report [here](https://respondmigration.com/blog-1/press-release-five-years-later-the-balkan-route-of-2015-as-exception?fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) \.

Croatian border police continue to perpetrate violence and conducted several [illegal pushbacks yesterday](https://www.facebook.com/NoNameKitchenBelgrade/posts/1069122886819328) \. People, including underage children and women, were beaten until their bones were broken, and parents were separated from their children\.


> “We were taken out of the group one by one and beaten up with sticks and metal bars\. I had to listen to each person’s screams of agony until it was my own turn”\. 




#### SEA

[Mediterranea Saving Humans](https://twitter.com/SavingHumansUSA/status/1304058687955312644?fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) set sail for the Central Mediterranean—we’re always glad to see more rescue ships patrolling as there are so many people in distress\. AlarmPhone [reported 75 people](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1304130813517352960) in distress off the coast of Libya during the night, but there is no word on their condition\.

Meanwhile, the rescue ship Open Arms currently has [83 people on board](https://twitter.com/openarms_found/status/1304139435920044033) that they rescued from distress\.
#### LIBYA

The UNHCR updated its services at the Community Day Center and its hotlines\. You can find the updated information in various languages [here](https://www.facebook.com/UNHCRTripoli/posts/1088525054878458) \.
#### SPAIN

IMPORTANT: if you are currently applying for asylum in Spain, you may also request a Residence Card as asylum procedures have changed\. Learn more [here](https://www.legalizados.es/noticia-ahora-puedes-solicitar-residencia-estas-tramites-asilo/?fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) \.

Are the Canary Islands Europe’s latest hotspot? It seems that way, as over three hundred [people](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1304104718134915073?fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) , including several children and [one pregnant woman](https://cadenaser.com/emisora/2020/09/10/ser_las_palmas/1599746966_798433.amp.html?ssm=tw&__twitter_impression=true&fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) , are forced to stay in a dock in Gran Canaria, in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions and no prospect of transferring to the mainland\. Many have been there for over two weeks, with no protection from the sun or heat\. The authorities are starting to relocate people elsewhere on the island, where hopefully conditions will be better\.

Meanwhile, [this report](https://elpais.com/espana/2020-09-08/no-salimos-de-la-guerra-para-vivir-en-una-prision.html?fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) \(in Spanish\) highlights the terrible conditions in the CETI in Melilla\. Over a thousand people are crammed together, facing bureaucratic hostility and the spread of a deadly pandemic\. They also have little chance of transferring to the mainland\.
#### ITALY

Italian Minister of the Interior Luciana Lamorgese [insisted in an interview](https://it.euronews.com/2020/09/09/trieste-lamorgese-contraddice-viminale-non-si-respingono-richiedenti-asilo-in-slovenia?fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) that Italy “respects the rules” and international procedures when it comes to asylum seekers\. However, her own subordinate Achille Variati admitted in parliament that “informal readmission procedures” have been used for months\. This is hardly the first case of European officials baldly lying or contradicting each other about their country’s usage of illegal pushbacks\. As always, people on the move pay the price\. Many expelled from Italy become victims of chain pushbacks that land them all the way back in Bosnia & Herzegovina\.
#### FRANCE

Everybody should read [this article](https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/people/arid-40046051.html?fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) by Holly Hughes, a volunteer with Care4Calais, about the situation in the northern French city\. People are sleeping outside with no protection from the weather, no access to basic supplies such as clothing for their children, and subject to violent evictions from police every 48 hours\. People are traumatized by the psychological violence enacted on them by police long after they leave the camp\.
#### GERMANY

On Thursday, members of the Bundestag [appealed to Malta](https://www.evangelisch.de/inhalte/175582/10-09-2020/hafen-fuer-etienne-bundestagsabgeordnete-appellieren-malta?fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) to grant the people in distress on the cargo ship Etienne, which has been at sea for over a month, a safe port\.

Meanwhile, [64 cities and municipalities](https://www.facebook.com/NewsfromtheMed/posts/1032950340491895) have joined the alliance “Cities of Secure Ports,” led by Potsdam, saying that they would accept people rescued at sea\.
#### EU

The fire at Moria set off a mini\-reckoning of sorts about the role of the whole European community in border violence, albeit a belated one\.

Ylva Johansson herself [admitted](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/10/eu-official-says-asylum-policy-impasse-part-of-the-problem-at-moria?fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) that the EU’s failure to come up with a common asylum policy contributed to the problem \(although the new migration pact due on September 30th does not inspire advocates with much hope that the rights of people on the move will be respected\) \. Others were quick to point out that the EU’s positioning of Greece as [Europe’s “shield”](https://theconversation.com/fire-destroys-moria-refugee-camp-another-tragic-wake-up-call-for-the-eus-asylum-policy-145899?fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) helped enable the dehumanizing conditions that led to this fire\. Writers such as [Jack Sheehan from Ireland](https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/refugees-eu-mairead-mcguinness-5198971-Sep2020/?fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) wrestled with how complicit their own nation’s MEPs were in creating the hell that is Moria\.

[This article](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/twec.13017?HootPostID=5165b1fa-8242-4b47-a715-3d0861609509&Socialnetwork=twitter&Socialprofile=wileyeconomics&fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) unpacks the theory that more development aid will stop migration, using Italy as a case study\.
