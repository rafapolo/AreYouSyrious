### FEATURE — What is in the European Union’s New Pact on Migration and Asylum?

The much anticipated new pact, consisting of 11 documents that you can read [here](https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/migration-and-asylum-package_en?fbclid=IwAR3TjZa_qOMzL01vHQ7SoCTqZG4KsEw5IMeQ4P6kPaFuRbFJc9oLU2GPCMk) , was finally published\. Advocates are already saying that the measures will hurt people on the move and impede their human rights\.

The pact will continue externalization of the EU’s borders through agreements with countries such as Turkey and Libya\. The EU will continue to send money to third countries whose human rights records are dubious at best to either entice their people to stay home or force them to stay put through border security measures\. The union has already spent millions of euros on schemes like this, even when [papers have proven](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/twec.13017?HootPostID=5165b1fa-8242-4b47-a715-3d0861609509&Socialnetwork=twitter&Socialprofile=wileyeconomics&fbclid=IwAR227eakvl8s-DCnDNM0Oq00womn4Za7UpK6aBGOvGBVNB87or-PfnzOS48) that development aid does not stop migration\.

No more containment camps at EU borders
No more violence at the borders
No more abandoning people at sea
No more deals with unsafe third states
No more suffering

■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 


The pact will create a [compulsory pre\-entry screening](https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/promoting-our-european-way-life/new-pact-migration-and-asylum_en?fbclid=IwAR2kwYySrCUjTk_JDucu2dyIPKEAbSLmWOJgg_zkcMuqj_UT6U9WYVyT0X4) where EU officials work with local authorities to quickly take data, including biometric data, within five days\. There is no word on how the union will guarantee that a person’s rights will be respected during this process\. For example, they state that “the information provided during the screening shall be given in a language which the third\-country national understands or is reasonably supposed to understand\.” Organizations including BVMN have reported that there are no interpreters during many pushback procedures even now when the timeline is less rushed, but the pact does not specify how it will solve this problem\.

There is also no mechanism to ensure proper medical care to people arriving at the border during these fast\-track procedures\. While the pact says vulnerable people will be protected, the text [says,](https://twitter.com/RShilhav/status/1308733664407191558) “If \[…\]the overall condition of the person appears to be very good, the examination should not take place\.” Who knows how many people will be denied vital medical care because a border officer decided they looked “very good”?

While the report mentions that special care will be taken to protect unaccompanied minors, there’s no mention of age verification processes that probably will still be used\. In the past, age assessment policies have been criticized for their inconsistency in different member states, their lack of scientific basis, and their invasiveness\.

This is a Quote from @[EU_Commission](https://twitter.com/EU_Commission) today on the #MigrationEU Pact

This is their interpretation of access to fair asylum procedures.

■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 


The second major change in the pact is the mandatory solidarity process where member states can either accept to relocate people on the move or pay for the deportation of people whose asylum claims have been rejected\. Essentially, this rewards the most racist European governments that have blocked any kind of meaningful action on resettlement by allowing them control over the deportation proceedings of the people they hate so much\.


■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 
> **[Andrew Stroehlein](https://twitter.com/astroehlein) @ Twitter Says:** 

> > EU's new #MigrationPact pushes bizarre "return sponsorship" idea - governments that hate refugees the most would end up having additional responsibility for deporting them. 

As my colleague says: "It's like asking the school bully to walk a kid home."

■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 


If governments will not pay up for deportations within eight months, then they must accept asylum seekers as “punishment\.” Treating people on the move as instruments of punishment dehumanizes them and feeds the right\-wing propaganda machine that portrays “migrants” as an imposition by the EU\. This also does nothing to solve the existing problem, which is that not enough member states will accept relocations of asylum seekers\.


■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 
> **[Begüm Başdaş](https://twitter.com/BegumBasdas) @ Twitter Says:** 

> > Solidarity scheme of #MigrationEU:
Member states can chose between supporting relocation or supporting returns.

-What if all member countries prefer to support returns?
-What if again the same system continues, only few same countries accept relocation?

This is NOT balanced.

■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 


The pact contains a clause that allows member states to suspend the ability to apply for international protection for four weeks in a “situation of crisis,” which the state can renew [for up to twelve weeks](https://twitter.com/Balkanizator/status/1308771505401212930) \. A situation of crisis is defined as an exceptional scale of arrivals that overwhelms the national asylum system\. However, [as the coronavirus has shown us](https://twitter.com/EleniKonstanto/status/1308857114048290818) , states are experts at using crises as an excuse to violate the rights of people on the move\. By creating a mechanism that allows member states to simply stop granting asylum, this does not incentivize countries to fix their broken asylum systems\. This retroactively justifies Greece’s decision to suspend asylum [for four weeks in March](https://twitter.com/lk2015r/status/1308834925634822146?fbclid=IwAR0k6OmVkIvKULJimq0YW4C7QVqNgNca_oJy9OQkYkBXYcrmtJaWSRiza4E) , which was widely criticized at the time for violating EU and international law\. This clause is a clear violation of [people’s right to seek asylum](https://twitter.com/marsemavi/status/1308846569626664968?fbclid=IwAR0k6OmVkIvKULJimq0YW4C7QVqNgNca_oJy9OQkYkBXYcrmtJaWSRiza4E) —a right that the intended host country cannot deny simply because it feels overwhelmed\.

The pact also does not do enough to address violent pushbacks or deaths at sea\. It calls for an independent monitoring mechanism for pushbacks, but [does not detail](https://twitter.com/lk2015r/status/1308823503701979136) how the mechanism will work or how its independence will be protected\. While lip service was paid to acknowledge the deaths of people who drowned in the Mediterranean, many [criticized the decision](https://thecivilfleet.wordpress.com/2020/09/23/ngo-refugee-rescuers-unimpressed-by-eus-proposals-for-a-new-migration-and-asylum-pact/) to not establish an official search\-and\-rescue operation in the Mediterranean\. Several search and rescue organizations, such as Sea\-Watch, banded together to publish [an open letter](https://sea-watch.org/open-letter-european-pact-on-migration-search-and-rescue-recommendations/) sharing their recommendations for an EU Pact that would actually save lives:


> **1\. Establish a European search and rescue program** 





> **2\. Support civil search and rescue operations** 





> **3\. End returns to Libya and the cooperation with the so\-called Libyan Coast Guard** 





> **4\. Facilitate an automatic redistribution system**

> **[Jeff Crisp](https://twitter.com/JFCrisp) @ Twitter Says:** 

> > EU Migration Pact:
"Since 2014, attempts to reach Europe on unseaworthy vessels have increased, with many lives lost at sea. This has prompted the EU, Member States, and private actors to
significantly step up maritime search and rescue capacity in the Mediterranean."
Really???

■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 


Another troubling aspect of the pact is that it enshrines discrimination by nationality into EU law\. The procedure will be different if people are coming from countries that historically have low recognition rates: “Asylum claims with low chances of being accepted should be examined rapidly without requiring legal entry to the Member State’s territory\.” Of course, this creates a self\-fulfilling promise: if people from country A had a low acceptance rate in the past, and the EU continues to deport people from there almost automatically, the asylum acceptance rate will never rise, even if people are in need of a place of safety\. There is no guarantee that people’s cases will be examined completely in these accelerated processes\. According to [Judith Sunderland of Human Rights Watch](https://twitter.com/sunderland_jude/status/1308745995812044800) , “These kinds of procedures are usually unfair and rarely that quick\.” There is no way to guarantee a fair assessment will be done, especially when the message from the highest of circles is to prioritize efficiency over humanity\.


■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 
> **[Judith Sunderland](https://twitter.com/sunderland_jude) @ Twitter Says:** 

> > It is wrong to think that chance of drowning at sea, or prospect of detention upon arrival, or possibility of quick deportation will deter people from trying to reach Europe. People take dangerous, risky migration journeys because they have to, not on a lark.

The pact talks about preventing “abuses” of the asylum system\. The dastardly abuses they touch on are the actions of people on the move trying to survive in a hostile asylum system by conducting “abuses” like—appealing asylum rejections\. Barely any space is dedicated to the abuse that the system perpetuates against people on the move, from the deaths in the Mediterranean to the inhumane conditions in camps like Moria\. Of course, that drives home the core point of this pact—the lives of people on the move, many displaced by tragedies indirectly caused by European colonialism, do not matter\. The only thing that matters is protecting the ramparts of fortress Europe\.
#### AFGHANISTAN
#### 81,000 People Return to Afghanistan From Iran

Thousands of Afghan people returned to their home country in August, including about [81,000 from Iran](https://menafn.com/1100846060/Afghanistan-81000-refugees-returned-from-Iran-in-August?fbclid=IwAR22mi74H9VT8cTJ2MCRo5ItlUY5Wsa-85YiR7VGNA4Zu466uYEHSioI3IY) \. Authorities estimate that about half were deported against their will\.
#### TURKEY
#### “Forgotten” People in Turkey

Refugee Biryani & Bananas shared some of the stories of people on the move in Turkey, who receive little to no support\. Many work 12–14 days in hard jobs for little pay, and are unable to receive justice when an employer refuses to pay them\. Many are crammed in small apartments shared among over a dozen men\. To read more about their situation and to donate so they can buy food and winter clothing, go [here](https://www.facebook.com/RefugeeBiriyaniAndBananas/posts/1750484628442929) \.
#### SEA
#### Alan Kurdi Heads to Marseille

In an all\-too\-familiar tale from the Mediterranean, no country responded to the Alan Kurdi’s request for a safe port after the ship rescued 125 people\. [For four days,](https://twitter.com/seaeyeorg/status/1308683143856230400?fbclid=IwAR0Wq2a7tUUAzDbTI_4JpjrgGh7L2N-OQSs6dEMUiHsTL7L3GdCLo8WeV2k) the crew sent requests to Malta, Italy, Germany, France and even Libya, but most of their communications were ignored, although the Italian Coast Guard did take eight people in medical distress\. Now, the Alan Kurdi is heading [hundreds of nautical miles to Marseille](https://thecivilfleet.wordpress.com/2020/09/23/alan-kurdi-refugee-rescue-ship-heads-to-france-after-italy-refuses-to-help/?fbclid=IwAR1V-y75q8qlYbQ-yKtC_i64BTTF3xFvTSmLLYrXQGCq9Uv97zru_KOEOr8) , where the ship is based\. There, the crew hope to find a safe port for the people in distress and [avoid another administrative blockade](https://sea-eye.org/en/alan-kurdi-sets-course-for-france/) in Italy\.

#### GREECE
#### Save Pikpa\!

With no explanation, the Greek government announced that by 31 October, everybody living in Pikpa on Lesvos “ [will leave](https://twitter.com/Lesvosolidarity/status/1308755462351978501?fbclid=IwAR0k6OmVkIvKULJimq0YW4C7QVqNgNca_oJy9OQkYkBXYcrmtJaWSRiza4E) under the responsibility of the Ministry of Immigration and Asylum\.” [About 100 people](https://www.stonisi.gr/post/11642/kleinei-to-pikpa-o-mhtarakhs?fbclid=IwAR38LrfeqhWIfzA1TaGWse8U-GX_X8pLvAXtVKs9Nvs__-Q5wa-7ZU3THxI) will be displaced\. Mitarakis claims this decision was done to satisfy the local community, but advocates suspect that the goal is to force all people on the move into closed camps such as the inhumane one replacing Moria by [attacking all dignified alternatives](https://www.facebook.com/pikpalesvos/posts/2761067164168697) \. The European Union is fully supporting the Greek government’s usage of the Moria fire [to push closed camps](https://www.dw.com/en/after-moria-eu-to-try-closed-asylum-camps-on-greek-islands/a-55032182?fbclid=IwAR3srag_y5FyWUJoy5j2gjKn3Xgj88IFqq4Qkz2b3LgTLI942Dus5f9NXwM) that effectively segregate people on the move, and Pikpa is the latest casualty of this movement\. Ironically, the sin of Pikpa was that it was too humane, and one cannot have humanity in Europe’s current asylum system\.

The push for closed camps and the targeting of humane alternatives like Pikpa is vehemently opposed by people on the move and their allies\. A group [entered the migration minister’s office building](https://www.ekathimerini.com/257318/article/ekathimerini/news/migration-ministers-office-targeted-by-anarchists?fbclid=IwAR2ye9lHampsOgf0_rB8_CY_Epui3cTDse7L5b9kGF4fw5WoZLVV36wYz68) and spray\-painted a slogan that translates to “No to Modern Dachaus\.” The NoBorders collective [explained the intervention](https://www.facebook.com/nobordersnetwork/posts/3363025770431958) , ending their message with:


> The dominant people want to turn poor against the poorer\. We must not fall into the trap\. They must not pass\. Solidarity to refugees and migrants, solidarity with our class brothers\. To close the disgrace of Kara Tepe\.

#### More Coronavirus Cases, Greek Government Blames People on the Move

The second wave of coronavirus is hitting Europe, and Greece is no exception\. [358 new cases](https://twitter.com/BrunoTersago/status/1308803230198124546?fbclid=IwAR01dWjN6daiacPTu8r5km2vHkPAgfOdK2GpH9dPLvX_TGBPcD83Ngeb-28) were reported today, including seven [new cases on Samos](https://twitter.com/samosvolunteers/status/1308735013983313921?fbclid=IwAR12Q7b1xyBmfHfVgmoAMEyk0JFru3-oKI0vH45rvBDKuO6X868DYQDuj9Q) \. Even though the vast majority of new cases were not related to people on the move, the Greek government blamed the “ [high number of immigrants](https://twitter.com/Hibai_/status/1308364368548110338?fbclid=IwAR0Wq2a7tUUAzDbTI_4JpjrgGh7L2N-OQSs6dEMUiHsTL7L3GdCLo8WeV2k) ” for its failure to curtail the pandemic\.

The government’s fear\-mongering has fueled the flames of xenophobia and caused tense situations like the one in Kamena Vourla\. Residents [blocked the highway](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/greece-highway-protest-migrant-health-fears-73198412?fbclid=IwAR3rGsLE628KJiKJwjP_0hhbVf416bJFm45M2fRBloN-ezbGgbcZPazOPj4) northwest of the town for about an hour to protest the arrivals of unaccompanied minors in their town\. The mayor announced that all schools in the municipalities will remain closed tomorrow as a sign of protest as well\. Many were motivated by xenophobic fear that the children would spread COVID\-19 and hurt the ongoing tourism season\. However, some people also expressed frustration over the lack of communication from the national government and with the conditions that the children would be housed in\. [“It’s not even fit for mice](https://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2020/09/23/kamena-vourla-refugee-children-protests-local-community/) ,” the mayor said of the hastily renovated hotel the children were placed in\.

Activists criticized the Greek government [for its inaction](https://www.facebook.com/nobordersnetwork/posts/3362987403769128) regarding the Chalki island shipwreck, which happened 30 days ago\. At least five people died, including a father and son, but the government hasn’t provided an explanation of what happened\.
#### SLOVENIA
#### People in Postojna Say “It’s Like a Prison”

The people published an open letter criticizing their conditions, which they say are to degrading and dehumanizing\. They described the restrictions on movement, lack of access to the outdoors, deliberate intimidation by police with dogs, and more\. You can read the full report on conditions in Postojna [here](https://www.mladina.si/201399/prosilci-za-azil-postojna-je-zapor-v-katerem-smo-priprti-proti-svoji-volji/?fbclid=IwAR3srag_y5FyWUJoy5j2gjKn3Xgj88IFqq4Qkz2b3LgTLI942Dus5f9NXwM) \(in Slovenian\) \.
#### SERBIA
#### What Happened to Solidarity in Belgrade?

A recent academic paper analyzes solidarity with people on the move in Belgrade\. As the Serbian government used vast amounts of EU funding to push people on the move in institutionalized camps, spontaneous, politically motivated solidarity groups were pushed aside\. You can read the full paper [here\.](https://movements-journal.org/issues/08.balkanroute/05.cantat--the-rise-and-fall-of-migration-solidarity-in-belgrade.html?fbclid=IwAR0uDgsQvv6-4zJfisqVhF8zJ2V_3M1sYS3DHijFEnDrvGnQbfAzV2a5zws)
#### ITALY
#### Six Men Found in Refrigerated Truck

Six men from Afghanistan were [found by Italian authorities](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/27480/italy-six-migrants-found-in-refrigerated-truck-one-covid-19-positive?fbclid=IwAR1587VlIAMRS1YLgjIR4FG0NxBA3VaV6uj8ODb8slKnjeQ9kM-eMf2RJf8) in a refrigerated truck in the Bologna area, that had come from Greece via the port of Ancona\. The driver was not aware that they were in his truck and called the police after he heard screams\. The men were almost frozen to death and were taken to a hospital for treatment, where one of them tested positive for COVID\-19\.
#### SPAIN
#### Almost 200 People Rescued Near the Balearics

[Almost 200 people](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/27501/more-than-190-migrants-in-13-boats-rescued-off-spain-s-balearic-islands?fbclid=IwAR3jeh3cN_5XXFIizgRznItulF2j51LULYE3R2IgtAOsIv3BHCIkFHU1niU) traveling in 13 pateras from Algeria were rescued near the Balearics in the largest number of arrivals recorded in a single day for the islands\. They were rescued by French Navy ships as well as the Maritime Search and Rescue authority\.

Several fires in housing for seasonal workers broke out in Huelva over the summer\. The APDHA Malaga produced a video report on this event \(in Spanish\) that you can watch [here](https://www.facebook.com/apdha/posts/3824236144272856) \.
#### FRANCE
#### More Evictions in Paris

Last night, the Parisian police again [evicted vulnerable families](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1543239169210183&id=598228360377940) who were sleeping rough\. The group of about 100 people, including 44 children, were forced to pack up their belongings and move to the suburbs, continuing the French policy of pushing people on the move out of sight to render the situation invisible\. They were finally allowed to rest near the Saint\-Denis canal, but only under the bridge and only until 6 am\.

During the eviction, families staged a sit\-in to protest their treatment and the fact that they were forced to march with no information as to their destination\. The police responded by [charging the group](https://www.facebook.com/U56ParisIDF/posts/2483830925249686) and beating a 16\-year\-old girl\. During the eviction, another child was hurt as well\. A neighbor was able to [capture the eviction on video](https://www.facebook.com/598228360377940/videos/338544434057282) , showing the swarming mob of policemen and frightened cries of children\.

Evictions are a widespread intimidation tactic in France\. In Calais, observers estimate that [750 expulsions](https://twitter.com/HumanRightsObs/status/1308827071754502145?fbclid=IwAR1SHjEB1A69EAtDaS3wTLAw3xaHHCBW42WmFzADV3ZE2v80Q32UQkdp4_8) have taken place since 1 January, at a rate of several per day\. The government recently publicized that they will [take 500 children](https://twitter.com/AFP/status/1308836782516178949?fbclid=IwAR1a-Y2r9nnpYevsu-fmnAK60-rlzwSuPN5Tu4ESSTTrEEYSIUHFwYLmU5w) from Moria—soon, will they wind up on the streets, chased by police, as well?
#### France Deports Kurdish Man to Turkey

Violating his rights to asylum, French authorities arrested Mehmet Yalcin in his house in [Bordeaux on Tuesday](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1542781872589246&id=598228360377940) and put him on a flight to Turkey on Wednesday\. He was immediately arrested by Turkish authorities\.

Yalcin has lived in France [since 2006](https://www.legrandsoir.info/macron-livre-le-kurde-mehmet-yalcin-a-erdogan.html?fbclid=IwAR1LxRN--ORJq04p6NiDiMmV3sC-Jj7w_uJoz4vxugNYXUjqhAIBy5BHS9A) after fleeing an unjust jail sentence and has a wife and three children\. He was waiting for a response to his asylum decision when a dozen police officers showed up at his house last week and whisked him off to the airport\. For a week, French authorities refused to tell anybody what had happened to him, not even his lawyer or his family\. Unfortunately, Yalcin is just another casualty in the trend of European states deporting enemies of the Turkish state back to the Anatolian nation, even if they can clearly prove that they would be in danger\.
#### GERMANY
#### Presence of People on the Move Doesn’t Impact Xenophobic Attitudes

In a study conducted amongst East German communities, which tend to have higher rates of xenophobia than their western compatriots, researchers found that levels of xenophobia or [voting behavior didn’t change](https://phys.org/news/2020-09-refugees-strongly-xenophobia-east-german.html?fbclid=IwAR2ye9lHampsOgf0_rB8_CY_Epui3cTDse7L5b9kGF4fw5WoZLVV36wYz68) after refugees were resettled nearby\. These results can be interpreted to show that xenophobic attitudes often have little to do with actual lived experiences\.
