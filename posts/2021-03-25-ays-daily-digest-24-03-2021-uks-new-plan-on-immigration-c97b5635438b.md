### UK

The government of the United Kingdom is planning A ‚ÄúNew Plan for Immigration‚Äù, the Home Office published a 52\-page bill\. Among humanitarian organizations, this draft raises concerns over future policy, as it is already mixing asylum and illegal immigration\. ‚ÄúThe asylum proposals are mostly irrelevant to the real needs of a creaking system,‚Äù [summarizes](https://www.freemovement.org.uk/a-first-look-at-the-new-plan-for-immigration/?fbclid=IwAR25UdAnF3HKfvdK5sO8kKtLIPvhACWIiD5-XefxpXbtGr0uT6G_qgqaCng) Free Movement\.

‚Ä¢ no returns agreement in place with any 'safe' country to take back asylum seekers
‚Ä¢no agreements in place with any "alternative safe third country" https://t.co/vroNXhZq3W

Further, the bill tries to separate ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúbad‚Äù refugees ‚Äî the ones who wait for relocation and those who try to do it by themselves\. For the first group, the Home Office wants to provide some minor bonuses\. But for the ones who enter illegally, the punishments will be even more stringent\. The Home Office wants permission to deny access to the asylum system, if someone could have claimed asylum in another country\. In consequence, people would be deported to the EU and other countries\. Others would only get temporary protection for a maximum of 30 months instead of refugee status, and no access to family reunion\. In detail, Free Movement finds many more problematic aspects, cutting the rights of those in need and putting them at risk of not finding a safe place\.

The British Refugee Council [criticizes](https://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/latest/news/refugee-council-responds-to-the-home-offices-new-plan-for-immigration/?fbclid=IwAR2bmkRSexcV9Phc4AnNyhLQBX4MrjBf-WNiQY2C9yqyoA0yhl0vgEwjzoQ) , that the Home Office provides no details or targets on resettlement programmes: ‚ÄúThe document commits to exploring ways in which the UK can assist people to reach safety from dangerous situations in their home countries, but offers no details on this\.‚Äù

Home Secretary Priti Patel already gave a [statement to Parliament](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/home-secretarys-statement-on-the-new-plan-for-immigration?fbclid=IwAR2HNp4aobvjvcmyspf4dhp39hcZu0lNKAGmp5YsuTsNqZsglGYKPJY1Qvk) , the Home Office has further published the full [Policy Statement](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/972472/CCS207_CCS0820091708-001_Sovereign_Borders_FULL_v13__1_.pdf?fbclid=IwAR0Bj536et2WPwd22LahDo-KaiODOZdFanNEbwTvROSvRRay_hO1PCcUtsM) \.
### Lebanon

Lebanese security forces detained and tortured Syrian refugees on arbitrary counter\-terror charges, reveals Amnesty International\. They used the same torture techniques that are used in the infamous prisons in Syria\. Between 2014 and 2021, AI documented cases of 26 people, among them four children, who were beaten with metal sticks, electric cables and plastic pipes\. ‚ÄúDetainees also described being hung upside down or forced into stress positions for prolonged periods of time\.‚Äù In most cases, the torture happened at Ablah military intelligence centre, the General Security office in Beirut or at the Ministry of Defence\. According to the interviewed victims, the security forces showed support for Syria‚Äôs dictator Assad\. ‚ÄúThere have been no investigations into any of the torture allegations Amnesty International documented, even in cases where detainees or their lawyers told the judge they had been tortured,‚Äù AI criticizes\. Even after the anti\-torture law from 2017, complaints rarely reached the court\.

More than 9000 people on the move are living on Lesvos at the moment\. The majority‚Äîalmost 6800‚Äîare at the Mavrovouni site, better known as Moria2, reports journalist Franziska Grillmeier\. Most of the people, some 70 percent, are from Afghanistan\. Of these, 35 percent are children, many of them younger than twelve years old, five percent are unaccompanied, and 23 percent are women; more than half of the residents belong to vulnerable groups\.

Following a statement by Mytilene‚Äôs mayor that the original Pikpa camp run by Lesvos Solidarity was handed over in ‚Äúhorrible condition‚Äù, the organization reacted to the accusations, saying: ‚ÄúPikpa‚Äôs shelter was recognised at a universal level and was awarded numerous times as a model example for hosting refugees and supporting the local community\. For eight years Pikpa stood as an example and demonstrated what people can do when allowed, by creating a space of solidarity, respect and dignity, equality, and non\-violence\.‚Äù

The team further points out that they had been given the site in 2012 after it had been abandoned for several years before that ‚Äî and there was massive damage\. Additionally, they were forced to remove all mobile units and some of the mentioned damage \(from earlier\) was about to be rectified through the support of international partners\. But with the much criticized eviction, the project came to an unwanted end\.

Meanwhile, EU‚Äôs Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johannson, is [visiting](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2019-2024/johansson/blog/spring-best-time-prepare-winter-why-i-am-visiting-lesvos-now_en?fbclid=IwAR1yCvRxtbHMNzrE4mn_JUa9lCP9PSNIBCZxJlEKjk48k6wBIDQdZTseRSU) the island at the end of March\. ‚ÄúAll responsible authorities must double their efforts and play their part,‚Äù she demands, so that further acts of inhumanity will not be repeated\. At the same time, she thinks 155 million euros for Lesvos and Chios and 121 million for the other islands will be enough for humane facilities and areas for families and children\. Considering that Greece has enjoyed the benefit of [3\.15 billion euros](https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-migration/202103_managing-migration-eu-financial-support-to-greece_en.pdf) of EU support since 2015, we should prepare for the situation to become even worse\.

Reporter and author Rory O‚ÄôKeeffe initiated a call to MEPs to stop illegal deportations and pushbacks from Greece, after dozens of reported incidents during the last days, weeks, months and years:


> The EU can and should be a beacon of legal and decent behaviour towards people in need, and a protector and promoter of international law\. But it will only be this if it acts to make it happen\.

### General

Amnesty International demands FIFA put pressure on Qatar, host of the football World Cup 2022, to stop violating the human rights of migrant workers\. The organization recognizes progress in term of reforms in the previous years, but they have not been properly implemented\. ‚ÄúThousands of migrant workers continue to be exploited and abused‚Äù, said Amnesty according to [InfoMigrants](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/31066/amnesty-fifa-must-protect-migrants-in-qatar-for-world-cup?fbclid=IwAR2yU-nfcjkV_Bc_uGh70vljBLa2bQsFtObGEzEikBb7kCAaqOD2FwffQa4) \. It is estimated that more than 6500 guest workers have died since the country was selected to host the World Cup\. Several fan groups are supporting a boycott of the World Cup\.

The Pulitzer Center will host an event with reporting fellow Angelica Ekeke on 31 March\. ‚ÄúHighlighting the Resilience of Refugee Girls in the Shadows of Europe‚Äù tells the stories of refugee girls in her project, _The Forgotten One∆µ\._ Here she will follow a 16\-year\-old girl from Nigeria on her way to Europe\.
