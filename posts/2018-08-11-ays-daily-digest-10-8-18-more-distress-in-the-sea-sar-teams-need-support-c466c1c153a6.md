#### FEATURE

“Last night the Aquarius overheard a radio conversation between the Libyan coastguard & offshore supply vessels about a possible wooden boat in distress\. After alerting the Libyan Joint Rescue Coordination Centre \(JRCC\) via email of our ability to help, we conducted a search\.
 Despite searching all night we had no sighting\. The JRCC did not respond to our radio calls & only answered the phone in broken English after several attempts\. We continued our normal patrol in int’l waters off the coast of Libya\.”

### Repression and violence against people continues

The hundreds of migrants arrested yesterday in Tangier and returned by bus were expelled to an area approx\. 5 km away from the city of Tiznit, [Association Marocaine des Droits Humains — Section Nador](https://www.facebook.com/AmdhNador/?hc_ref=ARRqS1xfJsyi6kgOCEatrjc-NmeLOL079dqwhgKqVnNXqjEwfzmjqyy-XtJ21vq4XE0&fref=nf&hc_location=group) reports\.

_It’s 17:30h\. Two buses on which more than 60 Sub\-Saharan migrants leave Nador, Morocco\._ 
_Arrests and refoulement continue\._ — [_Association Marocaine des Droits Humains — Section Nador_](https://www.facebook.com/AmdhNador/?hc_ref=ARRqS1xfJsyi6kgOCEatrjc-NmeLOL079dqwhgKqVnNXqjEwfzmjqyy-XtJ21vq4XE0&fref=nf&hc_location=group)

Along the way, in the bus, according to local volunteers, the people were handcuffed by the authorities, thus preventing basic movement of those who were literally being moved away from the area\.

> “The buses stopped at 3 a\.m\. in a campaign area\. We knew later that we were 5 kilometres from Tiznit\. Throughout the journey that lasted a day in a very hot climate, the police gave us one bottle of water\. We’re trying to hitchhike or have the money sent to those who can, to be able to return to our homes“\. 





Some intervention and forced expulsions were registered in Nador, against those staying in the provisional camps in the forest\. “This morning, the auxiliary forces attacked us\. They destroyed it, and destroyed it\. The few migrants who were still there have saved themselves, leaving in all directions\. Others have been stopped\.”

#### Collection of emergency aid for survivors of wildfires and those in solidarity

After our visit on 23rd July to areas affected by fire in eastern Attica, we call for a collection of EMERGENCY NEEDS for the people who are trying to re\-establish their lives there and those who are there in solidarity every day, skipping protocols, charities and assignments\.

We will go back there on Sunday and deliver necessities to the solidarity doctors and distribution teams\.

EMERGENCY NEEDS are:

\- Alcohol \(rubbing/medical\- for pharmacy kits\)

#### BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA

The European Commission has adopted a special measure for the amount of € 6 million to support Bosnia and Herzegovina in managing the migration flows\.

The EU funds will improve the capacity of Bosnia and Herzegovina for identification, registration and referral of third\-country nationals crossing the border, provide accommodation and basic services for refugees, asylum seekers and migrants and strengthen the capacity for border control and surveillance, hence also contributing to the prevention of and fight against the trafficking of human beings\.

These funds complement the € 1\.5 million already made available to Bosnia and Herzegovina in June to address the immediate humanitarian needs of refugees and migrants\. In addition to humanitarian assistance, since 2007 the European Commission has been providing assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina in the area of migration and border management in an amount of € 24\.6 million\. Since January 2016 Bosnia and Herzegovina also benefits from the regional programme ‘Support to Protection\-Sensitive Migration Management’ worth € 8 million\.
#### ITALY

A common protest by the exploited workers in the south of Italy is a part of the story unfolding to the rest of the country and Europe, telling the story of abuse, exploitation and slavery practices\. People have joined forces in the fight against such a system\.


> The project Fuori Mercatoof, solidarity between natives and migrants, shows every day that another way of producing is already possible, and allows us to fight racism and exploitation at their roots\.

### Demonstrations held in Amsterdam

People are gathering across Europe to point to senseless policies of the EU member states who support forceful deportations to dangerous countries where people have fled from threats, war, poverty and despair\.

One such protest was held in Amsterdam\.

> After the most recent eviction on Monday, when French authorities confiscated hundreds of tents, and with the additional pressure of heavy rain and storms, conditions have been challenging and undignified for the 500 displaced people settled in Grande\-Synthe\. 





> The evictions have become increasingly more savage, with reports of personal items being taken and people being left without shelter higher than ever\. Despite the constant upheaval and degradation, our friends in the camp are admirably resilient in the face of hostility\. Yet the desperation for shelter is undeniable, with large groups of people sharing tents, using just plastic tarpaulin for shelter or left to sleep outside and endure the elements\. 





> Yesterday, we found shelter from the persistent rain in the forest, and wove string around the trees for blind\-fold games and other sensory play activities\. Even at the most difficult times, the children never fail to bring positive energy and smiles to everyone’s faces\.

#### GERMANY
### Whom does the deal with Spain apply to?

According to [Handelsblatt](https://app.handelsblatt.com/politik/international/migration-regierungszahlen-schueren-starke-zweifel-am-fluechtlingsabkommen-mit-spanien/22901516.html?ticket=ST-1240344-qLhvPaLHI5s3PUbnkIdg-ap6) , the deal with Spain to deport people who are registered there already, within 48 hours, is quite useless\. It will come into force on Saturday\. Data from the interior show, that during the last two months, no deportation would have happened on this basis\. It is because the deal only applies to people who cross into Germany from Austria, which is a detour when coming from Spain\. 
In overall, there were only Eurodac matches with Spain for 8 people, who were stopped at the border with Germany\. But none of them at the border with Austria\.
German authorities have broken down data to see in which country there are matches and found 150 cases since then\. Of these, 1/5 are from Italy and 1/5 from Austria\. Still, the German government says it sees the agreement as a strong sign against secondary migration\.
### Gatherings across Germany
