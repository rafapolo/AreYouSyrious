Two years ago today, we were patrolling in the Central Mediterranean, the deadliest border of the world. We didn't know it yet, but we were spied on by an undercover cop. Now we risk 20 years in prison. This is what really happened on 18 June 2017: 

(THREAD) https://t.co/uAn4YcGIlj 

> **Tweeted at [2019-06-17 21:24:01](https://twitter.com/iuventa10/status/1140731849939046402).** 

■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 


The above thread continues to explain the events of the 18th of June\. Iuventa was 12 to 50 nautical miles off the Libyan coast when the phone rang at 4:20am from MMRC Rome\. Hundreds of people are in distress inside Libyan territorial waters but heading towards international waters\.


> “MRCC Rome, run by [@guardiacostiera](http://twitter.com/guardiacostiera) , is the competent authority to coordinate sea rescues in the Central Med\. Seafarers are bound by the duty to assist boats in distress\. The MRCC can deploy ships of every kind\. \.” 





At 5:44am Iuventa approaches the interception point, but instead of one boat, there are **three** **boats** , **each carrying approx\. 150 people** \. The Libyan Coast Guard is also there\. They remove the engines from two of the boats and presumably bring them back to Libya\.

Iuventa continues to hand out life jackets to boats A and B and secures/disembarks boat C\.


> “7:19am Captain Dariush orders two team members onboard Lilly to cast off and catch the empty Boat C, so the crew can destroy it later on\.” 





> “No NGO has the capacity to recover empty refugee boats, so the crews often **set them on fire to sink them\.** State actors and NGOs have agreed on this as best practice in order to avoid floating ghost targets and prevent smugglers from using the boats again for their dirty business\.” 





Yet an under cover Italian Police officer is hiding in a vessel close by\. A picture is taken of Iuventa and boat C and used as evidence that Iuventa was taking the boat back to Libya so smugglers could reuse it\.

This is the evidence the Italian prosecutors are using against Iuventa in court; a photo taken completely out of context\.

**_“This is how Italian police started criminalizing sea rescue\.”_** AYS stands in solidarity with all life savers on the deadliest border in the whole world\. Please learn more about Iuventa [here](https://www.facebook.com/iuventa10/photos/a.214639972584901/352619775453586/?type=3&theater) \.
### Egypt

[An interesting report](https://www.dw.com/en/is-egypt-using-syrian-refugees-as-a-bargaining-chip-with-europe/a-49237428?fbclid=IwAR1Y0oQYfxtrhq9dA4W_NWkMjbqjeAoQG1F674C6N3ISm8ABhk8vWvMp6bM) citing Ramona Lenz, the public relations representative for migration at medico international, talks about how Egypt might be using Syrian refugees in negotiations with Europe\.


> “Under current President Abdel\-Fattah el\-Sissi, the government is well aware of the negotiating power that the country’s refugees provide when dealing with Europe\. It knows how to take advantage of Europe’s fear of refugees\. So Cairo presents itself as a reliable partner to Europe in terms of migration policy and ensures that hardly any refugees in Egypt are able to head for Europe\. The EU’s efforts to “stop the causes of migration” are primarily aimed at easing its own financial woes\. And it is the refugees stranded in Egypt who are now paying the price for this power game\.” 




### Sea

On Tuesday, Dunja Mijatović, Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights issued 35 recommendations, explaining the deficiencies in EU policy to deter migration instead of saving lives on the Mediterranean\.


> “ They articulate around five main subject areas: **1\)** ensuring effective search and rescue coordination; **2\)** guaranteeing the safe and timely disembarkation of rescued people; **3\)** co\-operating effectively with NGOs; **4\)** preventing human rights violations while co\-operating with third countries; and **5\)** providing accessible safe and legal routes to Europe\.”

The 75 people stranded off the coast of Tunisia for two weeks agree that if they can disembark, they will be returned home\. Representatives of the International Organization for Migration hope to meet them and figure out what they want before IOM intervenes to finance their potential return\.

### Greece

IN Aegean Boat Report’s weekly stats, 41 boats with 1117 people were stopped by the Turkish Coast Guard for the week of June 10–16th\. 338 people were transferred to the mainland as well\. Find it [here](https://www.facebook.com/AegeanBoatReport/photos/a.285312485325196/595839290939179/?type=3&theater) \.

From yesterday’s digest, [the death toll](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1140728828790288385) of the shipwreck near Turkey has risen:


■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 
> **[Alarm Phone](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone) @ Twitter Says:** 

> > The death toll has risen to 12, among them 3 children. When the #Turkish Coastguard arrived at the scene, the boat had already sunk. According to #Aegean Boat Report, survivors were from several places, including #Palestine, #Syria, #Somalia and #Yemen.

RSA came out with a report on Tuesday called [**STRUCTURAL FAILURE: Why Greece’s reception system failed to provide sustainable solutions**](https://rsaegean.org/en/why-greece%CE%84s-reception-systems-failed-to-provide-durable-solutions/?fbclid=IwAR25V01GEQYUL5MSzp9cVK9ebDGb2lqS_7Vuv5D1TcxYp4MYiox151SF9lQ) \.


> “First, this study looks into the reasons why the Authority responsible for the management, implementation and control of the National Programs \(NPs\) of the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund \(AMIF\) and the International Security Fund \(ISF\) **has not delivered satisfactory results\.** 





> Second, it examines the national medical response project PHILOS since its inception and up to today\. 





> Third, this study analyses the Aegean islands’ decongestion strategy supported by the short\- term FILOXENIA \(Temporary Shelter and Protection for the Most Vulnerable Migrants in Greece\) project run by International Organization for Migration \(IOM\) \.” 




### Bosnia and Herzegovina

Human Rights Watch warns that a plan to relocate hundreds of people to a tent area near Bihac \(that we wrote about [here](ays-news-digest-16-6-19-dispersion-of-responsibility-at-the-cost-of-lives-in-biha%C4%87-235e7ad10a68) and [here](ays-daily-digest-17-06-19-postcards-of-desperate-conditions-in-montenegro-and-bosnia-9f11b8da4175) \) poses “a significant health and safety risk” for the people moved\. They are mostly concerned with the lack of the move’s adequate housing\.

> “The camp where humanity died\.
 

> First they transported people to this barren\. Then they started setting up tents and water tankers, without toilets \(there are enough forests, who cares that a place is crawling with snakes that are 1\.5 m long\)
 

> Clothes not changed for two, three months\. Footwear is a big problem to many\.
 

> They mostly complain about the police relationship\.They don’t understand why they treat them this inhumane and why they don’t let them go to try\.
 

> Stuck without any rights, many who have not spoken with families for days\.” 




### Germany

### Denmark

Activists finished a 24 hour demonstration in front of Ellebæk Prison; a deportation center for rejected asylum seekers, practically works like a prison\.

The demonstration was peaceful, and it succeeded for the humans in front of the fence to get contact with the humans imprisoned behind it\. The group “Close Ellebæk” Will continue support the inmates by giving hope, saying that they are not forgotten and informing politicians and populations in general about of the inhumane conditions humans beings are being kept in\.
