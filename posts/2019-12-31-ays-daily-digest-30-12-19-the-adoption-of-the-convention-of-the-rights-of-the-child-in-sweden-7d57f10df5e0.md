[On the 1st of January 2020 the UN’s Child Convention will be upgraded to law in Sweden\.](https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=83&artikel=7374800&fbclid=IwAR2HQTAS_xIkN8SC1TRGxIFe7ueC3XjIULpM0UIaKUR_AuNJinFet79mrjM) It will not affect all children though\. Asylum seeking children will not necessarily benefit from this, since they fall under the Aliens act\.

The network Liv utan gränser \(Life without borders\), consisting of families from Afghanistan, have been protesting against this since the summer, saying that the new law should apply to ALL KIDS — also theirs\.

Carl Bexelius, deputy legal chief at the Migration Agency, says that even if upgrading the UN Child Convention to Swedish law won’t affect the asylum procedure — but it could still benefit children since implementing the Child Convention as a law will extend the focus on children’s rights and well being\. The staff at the Migration Agency has undergone training and education ahead of the 1st of January in order to learn more about how this may affect their work\.

Worth noting is that Sweden prolonged a “temporary” and very strict, almost EU minimum level, law during the summer\. This minimizes the rights of asylum — also for children\. The “temporary” asylum law is valid until the 19th of July 2021 and during the summer of 2020 a committee will present a suggestion for a long term migration policy in Sweden\. The work and mission of the committee was announced during the summer of 2019 and representatives from ALL parties in the parliament participates in the work, which includes the right\-wing Sweden Democrats\. It’s not likely that Sweden will go back to the generous asylum policy’s it had before the fall of 2015 when the so\-called migration crisis happened\.
### Turkey

[Turkey just deported 33 asylum seekers to Iran\.](http://kurdistanhumanrights.net/en/turkey-deports-33-asylum-seekers-to-iran/?fbclid=IwAR1IjxGNF_YMkOkGByd2g03zrZZssR6LDdLaquzCUEjL4g7jqDbebOYf6cM) One of them was the Iranian Kurdish asylum seeker Adel Bahrami, who was registered with UNHCR\. According to Bahrami’s friend: “ _UNHCR transferred him to the city of Amasia in North of Turkey after registering his asylum application_ \.” Kurdistan Human Rights Network elaborates:


> “Bahrami had not received any ID cards for months after registering for asylum and staying in the city of Amasia, so he decided to leave Turkey “illegally\.” He was detained on 14 December in Antalya and held in prison until 24 December\. His case was also referred to court and the court ruled deportation in both instances\.”

### Greece

[Salam Aldeen](https://www.facebook.com/sk.aldeen.3/videos/1567204310104726/) , founder of Team Humanity, was live on Facebook Monday evening to talk about how this might be the last time he is allowed in Moria\. After being in jail for 16 days, he has been released for 3 only so he can pack up his things and leave the country\.


> “The authorities don’t want me to speak or document what is going on here so that’s why they are deporting me from Greece without any evidence or explanation that I did anything wrong\. Greece is suffering and we all know that but by deporting the volunteers and organization out of Greece will not make anything better, this will just make situation harder for refugees\.”

Police are denying people access to certain areas after numerous tents have fallen to bad weather conditions on Chios\. Solidarity groups are calling on Chios’ prosecutor to intervene and protect people from the extreme winter weather\. There is an adjacent area in which people could find shelter if not blocked by police\.
