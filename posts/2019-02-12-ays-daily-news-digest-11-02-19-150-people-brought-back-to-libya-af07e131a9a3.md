#### FEATURE

Alarm Phone says it was called by a boat coming from Libya with 150 people including 50–60 women and 30 children\. Their engine stopped working and no rescue was in sight\. The group has since then lost contact with the boat and as feared, they have been picked up by the Libyan Coastguard and taken back to Libya according to [Times of Malta](https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20190211/local/new-crisis-looms-as-150-people-drift-at-sea-in-the-central.701736) \.

A new [Time article](http://time.com/5510517/facebook-smuggling-libya-ransoms/?utm_source=emailshare&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=email-share-article&utm_content=20190210) shows once again why bringing people back to Libya is not the solution\. The article shows how people are being tortured, sold between trafficking gangs and held for ransom, forcing their families back home to resort to Facebook to collect donations from friends and family\.

Alarm Phone also says that, with no rescue vessels operating in the Mediterranean, the current situation disproves the myth that rescue vessels are pushing people to try the route\.

Meanwhile, [Avvenire](https://www.avvenire.it/attualita/pagine/immigrazione-open-arms-e-i-sindaci-spagnoli-dal-papa-poi-il-patto?fbclid=IwAR1bdg2WUqK52waBVNHm952tzLQ-_7w5xpcg4Kaf9TcbrYBd3niteh6tixU) says the founder of Proactiva Open Arms has been received by the Pope, together with the mayors of Madrid and Barcelona, to discuss the situation at sea\. Representatives of Sea Watch, Proactiva Open Arms and Mediterranea also met with the mayors of Valencia, Zaragoza, Palermo, Milan, Bologna, Napoli, Siracuse and Latina\. Together they asked for support for NGOs involved in helping migrants in the Mediterranean and hope to challenge the current policy of blocking ports\.

Two boats landed on Lesvos in the early hours of this Monday, with a total of 87 people according to [Aegean Boat Report](https://www.facebook.com/AegeanBoatReport/?__tn__=%2CdkCH-R-R&eid=ARB8JYbW36ObaXSauKTHh7EPtwEXKVWfuM6Dbv14XHo5TLojHgcIUhEwtKi5-VzpuL3nEv5RMwsir6aF&hc_ref=ARRCLk08wxN0CQ81QoAkpQWjVhHFzg9E7I5Ux5h-_G-TtlEwMbcPas3AqUEmR7Kmauw&fref=nf) \. The first boat landed on northern Lesvos with 48 people\. Refugee Rescue describes it as a “close call” as the dinghy had started taking on water early in the journey and people were freezing by the time they arrived\. A second boat with 39 people also arrived on northern Lesvos a bit later\. 
The second boat landed in Kalo Limani, Lesvos north west 06\.20\.
39 people

The group has been working in Greece, including in Chios and Athens, since 2016, distributing more than 700,000 food portions\. You can find out more on how to volunteer or donate directly on their [website](http://www.zaporeak.eus/) \.

Volunteer teachers and youth workers are needed on Chios for Action for Education, which provides the largest voluntary run education service on the island, as young people over 14 are denied public education there\. Volunteers are also needed on Samos were Action for Education set up a safe space for children and youth\. More information can be found [here](https://www.actionforeducation.co.uk/volunteer/?fbclid=IwAR1Gger8g4KdkCIvScEf5B59GiSq4qkBPob2sQJLlQkuqKLR3_MDA4M0tXI) \.

[No Name Kitchen team is now in Patras](https://www.facebook.com/NoNameKitchenBelgrade/posts/669523553445932?__xts__[0]=68.ARAZmH2BNNRrDaNSrMOJxbXy3DKfK6BlRLJbBX_JBC0p_qQF8CjY2Zq9AD5ITY5QH3p6vdevms02GHi3wlDywnok7rhlod4P8DRyfPtEoGCQ2dpxT8VwVtSLJUnuwmxWvDuxwvG883qKISmhqIFZBw9ELyUQXBL-9G3LcsL41zgN-TDnA_miZvkFV0DcaanaJD5dy5dKwbX5JINbE6u_CUmeEG3_5oI49WuxYp6xDEqHHAni41SclPc1RispoVFEX59fo9hCvQJh09WV5wl5q0jgLJiQB6QQZCKadu5ljdP3khyIwvLXVNn_0sGAfVvPFiZ0f3_IDjy05LVjvjav99k&__tn__=-R) \. They arrived 11 days ago, but they are already offering 140 daily meals, a number which has grown due to the amount of people in need living in the city\. A nurse has also joined their group to provide basic medical care and treatment\.

“All these people we are assisting come to Patras to play a “Game” which allows them reaching Italy\. This is yet another version of the sinister game which refugees are forced to undertake as a result of the closure of borders and the silence following their requests for asylum\. These people — the vast majority consisting of very young boys — hide for hours inside trucks which will be crossing the sea in ferries\. They tie a bottle of water to their backs with a rope to try minimizing the risk of dying in their attempt to reach the other side\. 
Even with the huge risks entailed, this is not a free “Game”\. Smugglers charge for this trip between 1,000 euros \(when paid in advance, with no guarantees\) and 1,500 euros \(when paid when reaching Italy\) \.”
### Serbia
#### 320 people in downtown Belgrade

Info Park has counted 320 refugees in the parks and nearby streets of downtown Belgrade as part of its regular evening headcounts\. The group adds that Hungarian authorities recorded a total of 107 unsuccessful attempts of irregular entries into the country over the weekend, out of which 94 were intercepted within Hungarian territory\.

In Serbia, the lowest temperatures will hit 0 degrees\. The situation is worse in Bosnia and Croatia, where the lowest temperatures will hit \-4 degrees and in Montenegro, where the lowest temperatures will range from \-6 to 7\.
### Slovenia

There 646 persons with recognised International Protection Status, most of them are from Syria, in Slovenia now\. Slovenska Filantropia groups offers advice, information, psychosocial aid, but also doing advocacy, and a three\-month orientation programme for refugees who have come to Slovenia on the basis of quotas\.

More information about where people are coming with this status, where they are housed, how many are involved in education and on the labour market, can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/Slovenskafilantropija/posts/2111408478940983?__xts__[0]=68.ARB73AY9o4dYm9CepZXB0XX_ARzMxFQbQIqT226udF1nz37tBrnokLgNb8NNpde441GLMyDKrD3iArrcrPQJYedWQU9j06bzRGZcwnKPDXP936qCUYoaCYUwNM5PAAw0n5wLG0rBiwT8mLkEm8tmsSOW6Ayc_KibGKa8dfdejnRs_IRopPZ4-kK-i-CrJtUSJ0B4cPd8zWJKtuWznFr4RTH_YqXBD2IA0rLGQRHdPQMxk5bVAZkZ3NUD6YCMIWYLQh2A9QPwht772nvRKQmP9tViU0fYGOrfec3wGLrRbLYzHO37t4Tf2y7G2l3d_wM4LeJcK8dXnHTZkgV05LNVGeXZsQ&__tn__=-R) \. \(In Slovenian language\)

[Refugee Protest Camp Vienna](https://www.facebook.com/RefugeeCampVienna/) says around 19 of February, many Afghans will be deported from Austria, partly on chartered planes\. The group advises people who are possibly under a deportation threat not to go to a police station if you are informed to go there for “gelinderes Mittel”\. It also advises avoiding places were police controls are common, such as railway stations or underground stops\.

People at risk include those who are undocumented or had a second negative decision in their asylum case\. An [event](https://hdb.dibk.at/Termine/negativer-Bescheid-was-nun?fbclid=IwAR2MxudEyFguyrKUf-XgTj2dqU7vsnqdrW5OZv0zWJfs4pn5GQ8wjbKEeb0) will take place today in Innsbruck for volunteers, to discuss how they can help migrants after a negative decision\.
