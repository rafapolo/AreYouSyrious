#### Leaked recordings show Italian officials aware of Libyan Coast Guard’s indifference, cooperated anyway

For several years, people on the move and advocates have been sounding the alarm about cooperation with Libya\. Despite evidence of torture in Libyan camps, despite evidence of brutality on the part of the so\-called coast guard, EU governments continue to send people back to Libya and share resources with local authorities\. Ever since the Italy\-Libya deal in 2017, which ceded responsibility for rescues in the Mediterranean Sea to the Libyan authorities, countless people have died as a result of the Libyan Coast Guard’s brutality and indifference\.

[New leaked recordings](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/16/wiretaps-migrant-boats-italy-libya-coastguard-mediterranean?fbclid=IwAR0FgQUEuxG8y8oLVDhtXImvqoctTLnSb8Q7PcFvrWmbQzTIbkNXqJ1eg7w) show that the Italian authorities were aware of the indifferent attitude their Libyan counterparts had towards rescues\. In one phone call, coastguard Col Massoud Abdalsamad responds to information that ten boats are in distress in Libyan waters by saying, “It’s a day off\.”


> It’s a day off\. It’s a holiday here\. But I can try to help\. Perhaps we can be there tomorrow\. 




In the spring of 2017 alone, several hundred people died at sea because Libyan authorities would not answer distress calls, even when Italian authorities themselves made the call\.The EU has officially known about the Libyan authorities’ inability to conduct rescues since 2018, according to an internal report, but the deals continued\.

One of the sad ironies of this story is that these conversations were only recorded because Sicilian prosecutors were looking for evidence to pin bogus charges on NGOs for smuggling\. Instead, they uncovered evidence of their own government’s complicity in hundreds of deaths in the Mediterranean\. Despite the Italian government knowing that Libyan authorities would not or could not rescue people in distress at sea, making NGOs the only actors preventing people from drowning, they chose to go after the rescuers\.

Just ten days ago, new PM Draghi made his first visit abroad of his term to Libya, where he [praised the government’s efforts](https://apnews.com/article/europe-africa-italy-libya-middle-east-14fde11cc7caf013e34f67c17cae90d7) in rescues at sea\. Of course, truth or humanity has never succeeded in blocking the wheels of politics before, and it will not stop them now\.

The Guardian broke the news of the transcripts the same day that a shipwreck killed [at least 40 people](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/least-21-african-migrants-die-boat-sinks-off-tunisia-2021-04-16/?fbclid=IwAR0CG_8U1QMpYe2UhuYqPW89O9dvM3gRXxSIqn1LZnOkIuWUBCxAlpLUYXc) off the coast of Tunisia\. Although this incident happened in Tunisia, not Libya, it still highlights the failure of the European response to the situation in the Mediterranean\. Since the 2017 deal with Libya, European authorities have [virtually ceased](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/criminalization-search-and-rescue-operations-mediterranean-has-been-accompanied-rising) their own search\-and\-rescue activities, happy to cede that responsibility to the Libyan Coast Guard, knowing that rescues would not happen\. They also simultaneously lay the rest of the responsibility on NGOs while severely limiting the scope of their operations and criminalizing them\.

Perhaps if there was a robust mechanism for search\-and\-rescue in the Mediterranean, the 40 people who died [would still be alive today](https://www.unhcr.org/news/press/2021/4/6079c76f4/unhcr-iom-40-people-drown-shipwreck-tunisia.html?fbclid=IwAR3ahGN7ydMyozbHL59jzhVp0L7djeRi4qTVFCbmdNwagGVDBtV5FEGVVa4) \. Instead, European governments are knowingly funding institutions that leave people to die\. Instead, 40 families will now spend their days grieving\.

This tragic loss of life underscores once again the need to enhance and expand State-led search and rescue operations across the Central #Mediterranean.

#### LEBANON
#### Putin and Hariri talk about returns to Syria

Russian president Putin and Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri discussed cooperation to “ [create favourable conditions](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20210415-putin-talks-with-lebanon-pm-on-syria-refugees/?fbclid=IwAR1o84Lhx8rhYIW55rfrIf5Ai6-XfmtziTeL0t9tykfg_2f-R6Cm-Om7Y3U) for the safe return of Syrian refugees living in Lebanon\.” Increased discussion about returns to Syria in multiple states, without consulting the wishes of Syrian people themselves, is troubling\. Instead of focusing on returns, perhaps resources could go towards improving the situation for Syrians, including the many children that are de facto [excluded from school](https://www.pri.org/stories/2021-04-15/syrian-children-lebanon-are-being-robbed-their-futures?fbclid=IwAR2iBtr7p6ktdJ1qPqHLHy88-5sjPHgc9rpr5_GLClf7aTV5aYCduWfDlr4) in Lebanon\.
#### GREECE
#### Numbers without explanations: the story of the Greek Migration Ministry

In a report on migration data released by the Migration Ministry, and [uncritically reported by the media](https://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2021/04/16/migrants-departures-arrivals-first-quarter-2021/) , the government said that “a positive balance of departures relative to arrivals continued in the first quarter of 2021\.” Migration and Asylum Minister Notis Mitarakis said that the migration “crisis” was over\.

Neither the report nor the transcription in the media examined why the numbers are the way they are\. What is the explanation for the departures, where are the people going? The government said that fewer than 60,000 people were living in accommodation facilities, but is it counting the people that were expelled and are now sleeping rough? What about the role pushbacks play in decreasing arrivals? If the government cannot be honest about why the numbers are the way they are \(and recent history has shown that it is difficult to expect the Greek Migration Ministry to be honest\), then it is the job of the media to ask these questions, not uncritically copy the government’s reports\.
#### End of cash assistance for people outside official structures

From July 1, the Ministry of Migration and Asylum will [end its cash assistance](https://twitter.com/rspaegean/status/1383129085803646976?fbclid=IwAR2DhNYJpwq6dFa3eQwdE3hGn67_yPQ779xLOIh_tRsV4zTWOP3dw43BurE) programme for people not living in structures under the ministry’s control\. This would affect about 25,000 people, mostly in Attica, and would only increase street homelessness among people on the move\. The Ministry helpfully suggested that people who need the cash assistance apply for state housing—which has months\-long waiting lists for the little housing that is actually available\. In the face of this news, it is hard to disagree with those who say [impoverishment is a deliberate strategy](https://twitter.com/aktuelle_stunde/status/1382773498783883265) \.

**Updates from Lesvos:**

Dr\. Martin Binder from Germany has been volunteering in the Kara Tepe camp for several months\. He [gave an interview](https://taz.de/Arzt-ueber-das-Lager-Kara-Tepe-auf-Lesbos/!5760664/) about his experience, where he talked about the sheer number of patients he had to treat, the lack of psychological care on the island, and the indifference of the camp management to conditions in the prison camp they run\.

Starfish Foundation is hosting a library in the camp\. Learn more about their work [here](https://www.facebook.com/starfishfoundation.org/posts/1420985121569674) \.

#### BALKANS
#### BVMN March report is out

Border Violence Monitoring Network has published [the March report](https://www.borderviolence.eu/balkan-region-report-march-2021/?fbclid=IwAR2DhNYJpwq6dFa3eQwdE3hGn67_yPQ779xLOIh_tRsV4zTWOP3dw43BurE) on the situation in the Balkans\. In this month alone, the network recorded 31 pushback cases, including our 1,000th testimony\. Other stories include increased surveillance technologies along the border and litigation\. We are proud to be part of the network, along with many colleagues from the region\.
#### ROMANIA
#### More arrivals, worse conditions

Because of pushbacks in Croatia and Hungary, more and more people passing through Serbia are turning [to the Romanian route](http://sinopsis.info.ro/2021/04/16/more-migrants-arriving-to-romania-and-to-worse-conditions/?fbclid=IwAR1qpzzxfADH7YVTTOnI-n0NUg91OB8bKCvuh1hguekneW40FyJOjYD4hMA) \. However, the resources are not there to meet the needs of people on the move\. Although conditions in the quarantine centre are relatively good, people in the overcrowded official Timișoara camp are living in horrible conditions\. Rooms are at double occupancy and the surfaces are filthy and mouldy\. Besides the people in the camp, there are hundreds sleeping rough\.
#### SERBIA
#### Updates from Sid

No Name Kitchen has published an update on the situation in Sid, where people are dealing with volatile, cold weather and police violence while attempting to celebrate Ramadan\. Their full statement can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/NoNameKitchenBelgrade/posts/1219528321778783) \.


> Beyond Ramadan\-related issues, we are beginning to perceive certain signs that follow from the agreement between the Serbian government and the European Border Guard Agency, commonly known as Frontex, we mentioned last week\. While no one has yet mentioned anything about agents with EU armbands on Serbian territory, we are receiving an increasing number of testimonies of violent and illegal pushbacks\. In this regard it is vital to highlight the massive joint work that people on the move are doing with us to carry out the Border Violence Monitoring Network’s Violence Reports\. It is not easy to achieve the level of trust necessary to open up and talk about all these repressive and traumatic experiences that happen time and time again\. 




#### SPAIN
#### Are the Canary Islands the new Lesvos?

It seems that we ask this question at least once a week, and conditions are showing that the answer is probably yes\. The Spanish government, either through inaction or deliberate neglect, is turning the archipelago into another hotspot on the Mediterranean\.

After arriving, instead of transferring to the mainland, people are trapped in overcrowded camps such as Las Raices, which [hosts 1,800 people](https://taz.de/Gefluechtete-auf-den-Kanarischen-Inseln/!5760627/) \. The organization that manages the camps cuts corners where it can, meaning people have inadequate medical care and their basic needs are not met\. [In El Matorral camp,](https://www.efe.com/efe/canarias/portada/varias-ong-de-fuerteventura-denuncian-que-faltan-comida-y-abogados-en-el-campamento-matorral/50001319-4513721?fbclid=IwAR35TVxc1QKJUzf5xs93WOtz5GfnlruPCaPdQpyJPOieqQQkEbvzkDGVdoI) people are not given enough food and have no access to medical care\. Most people have no other options—if they stay out of the camps for more than three days, they lose their access card and could be deported\.

Of course, many people do not make it to the Canary Islands at all\.

#### GERMANY
#### Confusion for people coming from Greece

For many people, once they receive recognized refugee status in Greece, their next stop is Germany\. The lack of support and threat of homelessness in Greece leaves them with no choice\. The Greek government indirectly encourages this movement\.

Right now, there are [11,200 cases](https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/europa/griechenland-deutschland-fluechtlinge-101.html?fbclid=IwAR2gcw6gQzcCp1yvGF_WKX4GxvGJhx2Ob0RAFO1MIynW_hvHIxNcAOsVjT8) on hold in the German court system of people with Greek residency, while the government decides what to do\. Although secondary asylum claims are supposed to be illegal under the Dublin Agreement, the courts have ruled in several cases that people cannot be deported to Greece because their basic needs will not be met\. This means that thousands of people are in limbo, although most prefer the uncertainty to the awful conditions they first witnessed in Europe\.

A new multilingual project aims to collect resources for people on the move in Germany who need access to mental health support\. Read more about the project [here](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/31581/developing-projects-to-improve-psycholocial-health-of-migrants-and-refugees?fbclid=IwAR3UZIsJIaSggEd2JpslXLnomugalCJ_elaG_7BRFL5QNmBthPocKIrpi9U) \.

Berlin\-based friends\! There is a demonstration tomorrow against companies profiting from the deadly border regime\. Read more [here](https://noborderassembly.blackblogs.org/agenda/?event_id1=1532&fbclid=IwAR0r4c4Kx5caeb8myrO4uqhEkkbj7hci1l63t_bxXzTxzZv4JbB4vSmgcwI) \.
#### DENMARK
#### Denmark’s “Return to Syria” policy popular among—white supremacists

For all that the government pretends its decision was made with rational, humanitarian concerns in mind, the dog whistle has found its target\. The far\-right group “Generation Identitaire” put up [posters in Copenhagen](https://twitter.com/WafaMustafa9/status/1382808475575717892) saying “Good News—You Can Now Return to Sunny Syria\. Your Country Needs You\.” This happened after the Danish government decided to revoke the residency permits of many Syrians because it decided that Damascus was safe for returns \(but not safe enough for its embassy\) \. The Syria Campaign is [collecting signatures](https://act.thesyriacampaign.org/sign/syria-not-safe-denmark?fbclid=IwAR11pMCZfC5SVIqNoAfA0VtqkGj1xJvGwXsbD15SznD_OQpQMdgpsNSTM0E) to oppose this move\.
#### GENERAL
#### Confusion about refugee caps in the United States

Despite campaign trail promises that he would undo Trump’s policies that almost ended refugee resettlement in the United States, President Biden might [keep the cap on 15,000 people](https://twitter.com/jeneps/status/1383095990048133121) in 2021\. His administration initially announced that they would only rearrange the allocations to include countries previously affected by Trump’s bans\. Later, the government issued a clarification saying that they might raise the cap on May 15\.

Even if the government increases the caps as promised, the number of people resettled will probably be nowhere near what was promised in the campaign, or what the USA as the richest country in the world could comfortably host\.

This past month, Italian authorities have stepped up their prosecution of solidarity workers, especially those conducting rescues on sea\.
