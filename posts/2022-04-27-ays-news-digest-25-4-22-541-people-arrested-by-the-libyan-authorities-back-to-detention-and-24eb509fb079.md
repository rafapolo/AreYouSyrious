#### FEATURE

On April 24, Libyan police arrested 541 people on the move in the city of Misurata, east of the capital Tripoli, according to the [media](https://english.news.cn/africa/20220425/96b93b378af34323aee3112368864064/c.html) \.

As reported by the director of the centre, Abdussalam Alewan, the arrested people, whose nationalities are unknown, have been taken to the Tariq al\-Matar detention centre in Tripoli, where they will remain until deported to their countries\. More on this [here](https://www.thestatesman.com/world/libya-arrests-541-illegal-migrants-1503064109.html?fbclid=IwAR1XpbqNW69EgSQ4r_YQGPtGDKVqCac9NsdQ9DGAXTgjZfiiiqCme6DxTJk) , but we didn’t hear about this in western headlines\.

And the ones who do, face danger and prosecution, mentions Sally Hayden, journalist and author of ‘My First Time, We Drowned: Seeking Refuge on the World’s Deadliest Migration Route’, in an article on [Open Democracy](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/refugees-rwanda-libya-uk-eu-boats-mediterranean/?utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=Echobox&utm_source=Twitter&fbclid=IwAR3vCdI1Xg-0L9TZ9kHpxf48jn37JJbbhdIZ98Ruj8iaDv7IiHdJUU_zYmc#Echobox=1650544526-2) \.


> “I was placed under a year\-long criminal investigation myself by German prosecutors, and received death threats and security warnings from government intelligence agencies”, she states\. 





Hayden discusses the real situation in Libya and Rwanda, and the support the Libya’s coast guard has received from the European Union to prevent people sailing towards Europe\.

As of April, **4,013 people have been returned to Libya, 167 of whom are minors** , according to IOM, despite an alarming [report](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2022-03/A_HRC_49_4_AUV.pdf) released by an Independent Fact\-Finding Mission appointed by the UN Human Rights Council indicating that the country may have committed crimes against humanity, as we have been reporting earlier\.


> “ _Up to October 2021, the Mission’s investigations concerning the deprivation of liberty primarily concentrated on seven facilities, believed to hold thousands of inmates, in three areas of Libya\. The Mission selected these seven for a combination of reasons including the vulnerability of the persons deprived of liberty and the variety of regions and actors concerned\. The Mission concluded that acts of murder, torture, imprisonment, rape and enforced disappearance committed in these facilities may amount to crimes against Humanity\._ ” \(pg 6, §26\) 



#### **SEARCH AND RESCUE AT SEA**

Sea\-Watch crew memb reports first\-hand the rescue of people drowning in the Mediterranean, on Twitter on April 22, after rescuing 38 out of 55 on a sinking rubber boat\.

“I knew we wouldn’t be able to save them all, and we didn’t”, he says in one of the tweets\.

A sinking rubber boat, with over 50 people in the water had been spotted by a plane. It was over 10 miles away. https://t.co/cXFIeGSUML

### **On the Ionian side**

On the same day, Alarm Phone reported that 86 of 90 people who were in distress two days ago in the Ionian sea off of Methoni in the Peloponnese made it safely to Italy on April 24\.

### **Survivors of a shipwreck facing up to 18 years of prison in Greece**

A shipwreck that [took place](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/37506/three-suspects-charged-with-murder-following-boat-tragedy) near Paros island on Christmas Eve has led to three survivors being charged with murder in Greece, risking up to 18 years in prison for causing an accident at sea, manslaughter, and joining a criminal organization\. 16 people died in the shipwreck while traveling from Turkey to Italy\. The suspects, aged 31 to 40, were among the 63 rescued after the tragedy\. Borderline\-Europe has organized lawyers and contacted their families in preparation for the upcoming trial on the Greek island of Syros\.


■■■■■■■■■■■■■■

> > ⭕ We have found them! Their names are Abdallah, Kheiraldin and Mohamad. They are traumatised survivors who are now facing 18 life sentences. We have organised lawyers and are talking to their families. Their trial will take place next week on Syros. We'll keep you updated.

### **Lesvos: Camps still suffering poor living conditions, despite EU promises**

Despite EU promises, the Mavrovouni camp — the newest one in Lesvos after the fire that destroyed the Moria camp in 2020 — still provides poor\-living conditions and limited access to services, says in a tweet by the grassroots movement Europe Must Act\. The Mavrovouni camp and the construction of the new MPRIC are going in the opposite direction of what has been stated by the EU Commission\.

### **Less than half of the people in Kara Tepe camp expected to “leave for Europe”**

The Kara Tepe so called “reception centre” in Lesvos currently has around 1100 people staying there, half of whom have reportedly been provided with asylum status and passports and are expected to leave for other European countries, as is expected by the local [media](https://www.stonisi.gr/post/20269/pasxa-me-adeio-kyt?fbclid=IwAR27FZz-ZewFqgdBrefKmBah4YV9_YcJCzqhQt6s7zNkVy_xYRRF1axBd3A) estimations\. The Greek Ministry of immigration and asylum has stated that there will be less than 700–800 people in the camps by the end of May, which is likely working in their favor of gathering funds for providing asylum and protection, but “getting rid” of people at the same time, a system that works against the people it should serve\.
#### SWITZERLAND
### **Bern saying “NO to Frontex”**

With the referendum against Frontex’s future and Switzerland’s contribution to take place on May 15, people chanted on the streets “NO to the Frontex expansion on May 15th and beyond — safe migration routes and freedom of movement for everyone\!”, on April 24\.

#### SPAIN
### Deportations continue

“Every Thursday a deportation flight departs from the Canary Islands to Western Sahara\. After more than a year with the borders closed, Spain resumed a month ago the weekly flights of Royal Air Maroc that depart from the airport of Gran Canaria to Saharawi territory occupied by Morocco, El Aaiún\. Since then, dozens of Moroccans and Saharawis have already been expelled from Spain, some of them without having fully fulfilled their right to legal aid,” it is [reported](https://www.eldiario.es/canariasahora/migraciones/grupos-semanales-20-migrantes-derecho-segundo-abogado-son-deportaciones-canarias-sahara_1_8934471.html?fbclid=IwAR1L5rehdlmtFrKIdWtJ1eSfOMH6QqIbfjZ9qE--iksX3b1TiYr9Oq8BQPY) \.
#### **BELGIUM**
### Afghans ordered to leave

Belgian authorities ordered 680 Afghans to leave the country last month\. Apparently, only asylum seekers who would personally be in real danger in Afghanistan have received an authorisation to remain in Belgium\. These include human rights advocates, journalists, and people whose sexual orientation is not tolerated by the Taliban, it is reported\. What this means in practice is yet to be seen\.
#### BELARUS
### Four people stuck on the Belarus\-Poland border severely injured

The four people on the move that we reported about previously, remain stranded for the second consecutive week at the border area between Belarus and Poland\. They are facing severe injuries and being prevented from moving back or forward\. They have been pushed back twice and physically assaulted by both Polish and Belarusian border guards\. Authorities on both sides are aware of their terrible situation and despite that many NGOs have reported it, however, they still remain in distress\.

Ms Patel is already facing legal challenges to Rwanda plans\.

### Frontex equipment requirements for 2023 include “lethal and non\-lethal weapons”

Frontex can now use its own, co\-owned, acquired or leased technical equipment, as well as equipment acquired by member states co\-financed under the [Internal Security Fund](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32021R1149) \(ISF\) \.

Member states are expected to provide all “off road” mobility, and all car diagnostic tools \(to detect cross border crime\) \. Seaborne surveillance vessels will all come from member states, while remotely piloted aircraft systems will all be provided for by Frontex\. Other aircraft for surveillance will come from both Frontex and member states\. 100% of the equipment for return operations will be provided by Frontex, Statewatch [reported](https://www.statewatch.org/news/2022/april/eu-frontex-equipment-requirements-for-2023-include-lethal-and-non-lethal-weapons/?fbclid=IwAR0ECNw-qd0hHAKGwT7ojSPGwnL9_DsvT6CaTjki4KP-TipcmBVgLiZE4ig) \.
