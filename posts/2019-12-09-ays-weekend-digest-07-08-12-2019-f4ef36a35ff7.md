### One deportation on the weekend and one “delay” but the man is still held in detention? For months\! Dignity and life is not a priority

The cycle of deportations and protests continue in Sweden\. The Minister of Energy, Anders Ygemen posted on twitter in regards to current rising anti\-Semitism about how we must stand against it\. Someone brought to his attention the ongoing deportations of people to Afghanistan, many of whom are facing life and death situations upon return\.

Ta ditt ansvar! #afghanskalivräknas

One man has been trapped in a seemingly endless cycle of deportation and delay, resulting in his holding in a detention facility since the end of September\. He keeps being notified that he will be deported soon, and then that deportation is delayed, but he is not freed, so as to ensure that he will not “disappear\.”

On Sunday, in spite of great effort to prevent the deportation, a 20\-year\-old man was deported to Afghanistan\. He has numerous death threats on his life and now people are deeply concerned about his fate\. People attempted to protest and blockade the deportation, to no avail\. The man is a Christian and was a Sunday school teacher in Afghanistan who was threatened for his faith\.

It is difficult to reconcile the projected “warmth” and “cheer” of the holiday season with the horrific realities faced by so many\. As some members of the religious right in the US generate false conspiracies about there being a “war on Christmas” as more and more militarized police are deployed to protect festive markets, it is impossible for it not to feel surreal and to be seen as the spectacle it is\. Endless holiday advertisements snip up before and after segments on people freezing in humiliating circumstances in Bosnia — you should care enough to feel informed, but not so much that you do anything\. Unfortunately, although many agencies report in order to “promote awareness” there remains the steadfast undercurrent that “being informed is enough\.” Being informed is an important first step, but knowing without action is simply self\-congratulatory\. “I’m a better person than these other people here because at least I know what’s going on\.” How does your knowledge help those who were just deported, who wait in fear at being deported? Action without knowledge and organization is harmful, of course\. But knowledge without action eventually cultivates either burnout \(“I can’t do anything”\) or worse yet, callousness\. In this way, the desire to “be informed” can sometimes backfire, serving to inoculate people against meaningful engagement\. From the perspective of the author, the next step from being informed is to sit with the discomfort of being informed\. Don’t brush it away or flinch from it\. And then start to reach out\.

The information on these cases is from a group focused on preventing deportations in Sweden\. To get involved, please contact us on our facebook page and we will direct you to the appropriate group\.
### Government complicity with Horrific Violence against Protestors in Iraq

Those demonstrating in Iraq are facing wave after wave of horrifying violence, from massive knife attacks to attacks with guns\.

“December 6th\. A new list by the US representatives was announced, including sanctions for four actors: Qais Al\-Khazali, Laith Al\-Khazali, Hussein al\-Lami, \(accused of giving direct orders to shoot protetors with the intervention of snipers, from October 3 to 15\), and Khamis al\-Khanjar\. That evening, in al\-Khulani square, **armed men in civilian clothes, carrying automatic weapons and RBG7 weapons, created panic as they drove cars towards the crowd on the streets, attacking the protesters in one of the public garages on the square and burning the upper floor of the garage\.”**

Although the attacks happened within 6 minutes of the Ministry of Defense, nothing was done by security forces to prevent the attacks\. Later, a leaked document show that a major in the security forces was _aware of the gathering of the militants\._ For the full update read our [exclusive special](ays-special-updates-from-baghdad-1-caf4159ce913) \. The original coverage can be read [here](ays-special-updates-from-baghdad-1-caf4159ce913) and we will release updates as they are made possible\.

Hard to believe, right?

What is harder to believe is that this bathroom where 3 young children have shower 🚿 in is in Europe. 
This is the reality of about 2,500 children living in #Vathy camp in #Samos, #Greece. https://t.co/Fdi5ZQwJWQ

In an interesting note, a member of the Greek government has stated that they will send back [“10,000 illegal migrants”](https://twitter.com/BrunoTersago/status/1203648442280611841) in 2020…this statement came from the…minister of agricultural development? Interesting how agriculture is weighing in on a domain that is not theirs\.

#### In Italy, German rules are blamed in enabling lack of care to people

_“Our friends in Sicily write that they did not freeze the first night\. In the camp, they only get food, nothing else, because Germany is responsible, but does not bend a finger to retrieve the rescued & integrate\. Boredom is the worst, they say\.” Translated from below\._

#### More people are being rescued in Spanish waters

26 people were rescued near the Grand Canary Islands in Spanish waters\. The rescued were taken to a small town of 2,500 to await the next step, so as to get them off of the precariously overloaded vessel\. Additionally, the 126 people rescued on Thursday from the Alboran sea had been kept on the island of Alboran due to inclement weather\.

#### Protests on the intersections of climate change, war, and migration in Stuttgart and a stay of deportation remains in place for Syrians in Germany

500 people gathered in Stuttgart to protest against the myriad of factors that are resulting in the disenfranchisement and abuse of millions of people around the world\.

“An Alliance of 40 organizations had called for this\. “For a world where no one has to flee — time to act\!” was the motto\. Climate, peace and sea rescue movements were represented\. On Posters, banners and umbrellas, it read: “no man is illegal”, “ escape has causes”, “Sea Rescue is not a crime”\. with a view of the dangerous escape routes to Europe, the demonstrating crosses at the central castle square for the Refugees drowned in the Mediterranean\.’”

A recent proposal by the Federal Ministry of the Interior of Germany to end the suspension of deportations for “dangerous offenders” back to Syria will not go through as the ban on deportations will be continued until mid next year\. Earlier members of the Ministry of the Interior at various state and federal levels met and proposed to enable the deportation of Syrians who had committed “serious offences” and who had been found to have visited their home country\. This was sharply criticized by the Federal Foreign Office which reaffirmed that there remain dangerous circumstances for Syrians returning to Syria, with high numbers of arrests and disappearance under suspicious circumstances\.

For now the ban on deportations will continue through the first half of 2020 for certain\. Additionally, there is more needed specificity on what the criteria of “serious offenses” constitute\.

#### Drones in the UK and France to enhance “interception”

The British Coast Guard will be employing drones in monitoring the channel for irregular migration, according to news from the BBC\. In a “cross border collaboration” move, drones have also been delivered to France in order to aid intercepting people in French waters, presumably so as to prevent additional snarls regarding illegal pushbacks and return\. The sourcing of these drones is not yet known\. For more, go [here](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-kent-50673241) \.
