### GREECE
#### Over the weekend, human rights organisations and individual activists on Lesbos [protested against the illegal pushbacks of asylum seekers](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/41673/activists-on-lesbos-slam-greece-for-pushing-back-migrants?preview=1656942387474)

Several ministers continue to deny that the coastguard is conducting pushbacks despite the vast amounts of evidence\.
### SERBIA
#### One person has died and another six left injured after a shootout between migrant groups near the Serbia\-Hungary border

It took place roughly 1km from the Hungarian border, after they had been stranded there while trying to reach Hungary\. It is still unclear what triggered this event and police have not yet released a statement\.

### ITALY

96 **asylum seekers have reached Libya on a UNHCR charter flight**

The group came from detention camps in Libya and have experienced trafficking, torture, and other forms of abuse\.

This flight was the third one since the implementation of a protocal in April 2021 by several institutions, such as, the Italian ministries of interior and foreign affairs, the UNHCR, and the Community of Sant’Egidio\.

Chiara Cardoletti, the UNHCR representative for Italy stated:


> “It is an important sign of solidarity and humanity\. In an increasingly uncertain and unsafe world, where over 100 million people have been forced to flee, we hope to be able to continue working together to widen safe pathways — including resettlement — allowing refugees to rebuild their lives safely and with dignity\.”

A spokesperson for the UK Home Office stated:


> “We remain committed to our world\-leading migration partnership with Rwanda, which will see those arriving dangerously, illegally or unnecessarily into the UK relocated to rebuild their lives\. This is vital to prevent loss of life in the Channel and break the business model of people smugglers\. Preparations for the next flight are under way\.”
