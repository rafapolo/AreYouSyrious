### AYS DAILY DIGEST 5\.1\.17\- Additional homeless shelters available in Greece
#### Feature

With this winter proving to be a particularly cold one, those who find themselves without a roof over their head will be particularly at risk\. Among many of the homeless in Greece are, of course, refugees\. The infrastructure to keep the homeless warm has been expanding for a few weeks now, and it is exciting to see that more places are opening to keep people safe from the elements\. With snow expected to fall soon, these shelters may be vital to peoples‚Äô survival\.

### Protest following the death of a refugee leads to pledges to deport those whose asylum applications were rejected

Following the death of a refugee woman as the result of a blood clot on Monday, the 500 residents of the Cona refugee center in Veneto staged a protest\. They claim that the center‚Äôs staff would not call an ambulance for hours, despite it being clear that the woman was in need of medical assistance\. Objects were set on fire, but nobody was injured in the course of the demonstrations\.

The woman‚Äôs death seemed to have been the last straw which pushed refugees to the edge\. When a parliamentary delegation visited the camp, they drew attention to the dreadful conditions, with one representative warning that the camp, a former military barracks, was a ‚Äúticking time bomb\.‚Äù Refugees also protested the subpar conditions here in the early months of 2016\.

Far\-right politicians have used the incident to their advantage\. Matteo Salvini of the Northern League said, ‚ÄúWhen I‚Äôm in government, there will be mass expulsions, centre closures, and the navy ships will send people back after saving them\.‚Äù

### UNICEF report shares the agency‚Äôs efficacy for 2016 and targets for 2017

The group‚Äôs report, which may be read [here](http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/2017_Crisis-in-Europe_HAC%282%29.pdf) , shows that in many areas, the agency fell far short of its targets\. The group had received less funding than it had called for, $22 million rather than $31 million\. For 2017, the group has set a goal of $47\.5 million\.
