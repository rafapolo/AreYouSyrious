#### GREECE
### Trying to be a child in Idomeni camp


> _The Flying Seagull Project is trying to make a childhood for refugee children possible, even in the worst of the environments, such as Idomeni\. This is what they say about their work in Idomeni:_ 





> “Another extremely challenging week has come to and end and we have shared laughter with over 1500 children seeking refuge on the Macedonia border\. 





> It is so difficult to describe the situation her as it is one of complete contradiction\. The hardship and lack of structure has made the children at times very aggressive and impossible to communicate with and at other times so affectionate and heartbreakingly beautiful\. 





> We have been visiting four camps every day and feel like we are finally making progress\. With structured games and masses of positive encouragement they are responding well and starting to play well together\. 





> The environment is tough, the atmosphere can be toxic and oppressive but with just a little hope the day can turn around for these kids\.”

### Interview with S\. who is living in the camp in Chalkero


> **Moving Europe: Can you tell us about you the situation in Chalkero?** 
 

> We are loosing our hopes day by day\. And people get more and more angry\. The situation is very difficult\. Only very few people reach the asylum service via Skype, the option of relocation seems to be a trap and the conditions of living are bad\. We all are running out of money\. 





> **Moving Europe: Do people have to spend a lot of money?** 
 

> The food is so bad, that most families buy groceries to cook their own food on small fires\. We cannot eat the military food anymore\. Macaroni pasta for weeks and weeks just makes you sick\. That means that a family has to spend around 20 Euro a week for food\. Al lot of people have to ask friends and families for money in Syria and ask if they can send money by Western Union to Kavala\. But 20 Euro is a small fortune nowadays\. Because of the war the inflation skyrocketed\. Now you need around 600 Syrian Pounds for 1 Euro\. But the average monthly salary is just about 16’000 Syrian pounds\. This is now just around 25 Euro\.

### End detention now\!


> _The May 7th is a Transnational day of solidarity with detained people and protest against detention centres\. May 7th is part of a wider transnational campaign to shut down detention centres and end the inherently abusive and violent system of immigration detention that criminalises, detains, and imprisons people simply because they have chosen or been forced to migrate\. Actions also take place in solidarity with wider struggles against borders and migration controls and with people who are living in detention without walls, from Calais to Idomeni\. So far actions have been planned across the UK and in The Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and Iceland\._ [Find out where protests are happening](https://shutdowndetentioncentres.wordpress.com/find-out-where-protests-are-happening/) \!
