On Friday night, the SeaWatch 3 entered the port of Santa Pelagia Bay, north of Syracuse and is now anchored there, according to [Mediterranea](https://mediterranearescue.org/en/news-en/immediatedisembarkmentseawatch3/?fbclid=IwAR2TXIQMvfI4eKQ-V5zhU_KzfuxawjVjGdeJB7iY2MQZTRwSKGK3a3EAO4s) n Rescue\. The Italian government and Interior Minister Salvini in particular, say that the SeaWatch 3 will not be able to disembark in an Italian port, while Francesco Italia, mayor of Syracuse, says “the city is ready to welcome the 47 people on board”\.

Mediterranea now demands that the Italian government assigns to Sea\-Watch 3 the port of Syracuse as a “Place of Safety” and immediately authorises the disembarkment of the 47 shipwrecked and rescued people\.

SeaWatch meanwhile has launched a [petition](https://www.change.org/p/eu-commission-sea-rescue-is-non-negotiable-open-the-ports-for-sea-watch-3) , calling on the European Commission to put an end to the undignified haggling over people’s lives and the establishment of a sustainable solution under which similar cases in future will be allocated a safe harbour without delay\. The people have been aboard the ship since last Saturday\.

The Libyan coastguard says it has intercepted and brought back a total of 473 migrants to its shores over the course of 72 hours, according to [Infomigrants](http://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/14705/nearly-500-migrants-brought-back-to-libya-in-72-hours) \. [Corriere Della Sierra](https://www.corriere.it/foto-gallery/esteri/19_gennaio_25/torture-gabbie-immagini-centro-detenzione-libico-f3b035e6-20a7-11e9-926b-daa18cae285e.shtml?fromArticle=true&fbclid=IwAR0hMd1xo4OKD-mS9gKesswgTRBNcYzQ8nbRVveed_W8_GJVrCNAJ3HGARU&refresh_ce-cp) has published photos, showing clear evidence of torture and disgraceful living conditions in Libyan prisons\. On Monday already, [Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/01/21/no-escape-hell/eu-policies-contribute-abuse-migrants-libya) had published a report, showing how EU Policies contribute to the abuse of migrants in Libya\. In July 2018, Human Rights Watch researchers visited four detention centers where they documented


> “Inhumane conditions that included severe overcrowding, unsanitary conditions, poor quality food and water that has led to malnutrition lack of adequate healthcare \(…\) and disturbing accounts of violence by guards” 





It adds that the EU is providing support to the Libyan Coast Guard to enable it to intercept refugees at sea, after which they take them back to Libya to arbitrary detention\.
### Turkey
#### Girl killed in hate attack

A child has lost her life in a hate attack on a Syrian family in Gaziantep\. The family, living in the Vatan quarter of Gaziantep, were attacked by unknown persons in their home, [media are reporting](https://www.gazeteduvar.com.tr/gundem/2019/01/25/suriyeli-aile-saldiriya-ugradi-1-cocuk-hayatini-kaybetti/?fbclid=IwAR08NpzC9crgA-SEODYWTOcic0z0f-3Fj2ZOGdAkrx6PNR5d_qKB1V5EWBo) \.

**The victims, Ayşe Farmeti and her three children Hanan, 15, Nur el Nude, 11, and Raman Elalawi, 8, were beaten and hit over the head with a heavy object\.** Hanan Alalawi lost her life; the mother and two younger children were taken to the hospital with life threatening injuries\. The victims were found by the father, who had been out of the house, running an errand\. An autopsy will be conducted on Hanan; a police investigation is ongoing\.
### Italy
#### Salvini admits acting illigally

There is a possibility that Interior Minister Matteo Salvini could be charged with kidnapping, after he prevented refugees from disembarking an Italian coast guard ship in August\.

This is the rulling made by a court in Sicily this week\. So far, Salvini has not appeared to find this in any way worring for him\. In a post on Facebook he said: “I confess, there is no need for a trial\. It’s true, I did it and I’d do it again\.”
### Greece
#### Living conditions in Moria have not improved

The power cuts in Moria continue\. Refugees have to live in the same miserable situation, despite the promises\. From 14–20 January 640 people reached the Aegean islands, the majority of whom arrived to Lesvos, according to UNHCR\.

The average daily arrivals on all islands was 91 in this time\.

In the hotspot of Moria, children are still not attending formal Greek education\. Children account for 30% of the refugee population on the islands, of whom more than 6 out of 10 are younger than 12 years old, according to UNHCR\.
### Bosnia
#### Violance under the UN watch

On Friday night, we recived a very disturbing video from Miral, one of the IOM run camps in Bosnia, showing a security guard in this camp beating up one of the residents\.
