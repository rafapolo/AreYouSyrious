> _Share the truth about Samos hot spot and hit the authorities hard:_ 





> _\- 4500 people live imprisoned in a structure built for 650\._ 
 

> _\- of these 4500, over 1500 are children\._ 
 

> _\- of these, 300 are unaccompanied minors\. They should be the most protected persons in the field, yet they live in numbers of 30 in a container built for 8, sometimes without doors and windows, without electricity or running water\. Some live even in camping tents_ 
 

> _\- to over 1500 children the right to education is denied: local schools do not accept them, despite being a constitutional right of every child on Greek soil\._ 
 

> _\- girls take many risks with families fearing assaults letting them come to our school\. Even when reported, the police don’t raise a finger regarding abuse cases\._ 
 

> _\- to over 1500 children the right to nutrition is denied: the tail for meals lasts up to 4 hours\. You often go to bed without dinner\. Food quality is inadequate to development\._ 
 

> _\- to over 1500 children the right to security is denied: police brutality on minors is on the agenda\._ 
 

> _\- over 1500 children the right to shelter is denied: dozens of families are forced to live in camping tents, exposed to the weather, in the woods adjacent to the field\._ 
 

> _\- there are only two doctors for 4500 people\._ 
 

> _\- it’s estimated there’s 1 shower for every 200 people\._ 
 

> _\- the bathrooms are broken and the sewage drains directly onto the curtains where people sleep\._ 
 

> _\- police hold and beat minors, sometimes without apparent reason, often asking them to sign statements in a language they do not understand, in order to be released\._ 
 

> _\- authorities separate families\._ 
 

> _\- the sanitation and waste disposal system is insufficient\. People collect trash, but a system is missing in order to remove it\._ 
 

> _\- Parasites and infections are common\._ 
 

> _\- thousands of human beings every year are forced to live for an average of six months in a place that worsens their psychological state, and this was confirmed and reported by the MSF \(Doctors without borders\) in 2018\._

### Athens

After a week doing emergency coat distribution in Samos, the Pampiraiki team is back in Athens\. In their weekly report, the team reports a great number of actions needed to be able to face the harsh winter of this year\. They expanded the aid provided within the Attika area, as well as on the islands and mainland Greece\.


> We are currently in need of contributions, both monetary and in kind\. At present we are very low in funds needed in order to : 
 

> provide food to at least the 2,000–2,500 people living
 

> in squats and other residences in Athens and 
 

> for the transportation of goods and other operating 
 

> costs\. 





They also need volunteers to help, whether for a few days, or in a constant manner\.

[Azadi Squat Athens](https://www.facebook.com/AzadiSquatAthens/) , hosing about 50 people at the moment, reports also needing donations, particularly in food:


> We are around 50 people living peacefully together\. Most of us are woman and children\.
 

> We are on the way to set up the house in a good living standard for everyone who is having a room in the building\.
 

> Currently we are not able to take new people in the Squat\. But we are able to take care of those who are living inside\! 





> What we need:
 

> Blankets
 

> Pillows
 

> Lamps
 

> Fridge
 

> Soap 





> and urgently we need food donations\!
 

> We are happy to get dried food donations from Pamperaki \!
