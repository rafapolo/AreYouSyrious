#### FEATURED STORY
### Europe Day?\!

Yes, this week was \(is\) amazing for all football fans and for the EU\. When it comes to football, borders do not count anymore\. And now it’s even Europe day\! So, let us start with some positive things\.

Yes, we should value the efforts that have been made since the end of World War II\. Let us celebrate that the EU is a 70\+ year old \(ongoing\) project of peace; that we can cheer for football all across the continent; that we can argue about which party to vote this month \(please vote\! \) \.

Yes, we — the civil societies of Europe, not only the EU, — and politics achieved many positive things\. Nevertheless, we should not forget our responsibilities and talk about some other topics\. It’s a long way to improvement\. We must do bettter\. There is still too much injustice within our system and even more around us\.

While European, and especially EU citizens, are able to ignore the current situation regarding Human Rights and other basic questions, to celebrate a common day of ‘peace and wealth’, most cannot, because they are suffering the repressions caused by the very system\. **Due to the EU\-Turkey deal, more than 20,000 people are trapped on the Greek islands in dire living conditions** , Samos volunteers [remind](https://www.facebook.com/samosvolunteers/photos/a.567427800102051/1236662756511882/?type=3&permPage=1) us\. Thousands more are in countries like Italy and Spain\. Tens of thousands are **stuck in Lybia or Morocco,detained and tortured,** hoping to find refuge in Europe\.

Unfortunately, it is unavoidable today to once again to critically inspect the Mediterranean situation and beyond\. MSF stresses that the camps in Lybia are helplessly overcrowded: “Prospects for evacuation are so limited that some detainees with \[internal\] protection needs have spent up to a year stuck there\. A DC shut down 4 months ago by the Libyan DCIM \[because\] of severe protection concerns has now reopened\.”


> More than 3000 people are trapped in detention centres in and around Tripoli\. Only 455 were evacuated\. 




Almost 400 have been killed, 2100 wounded, and 60,000 displaced\. One man says:


> We are like a ball that they are playing with\.

While the country is in a war, the so called Libyan Coast Cuard is still intercepting and pulling back people, who try to leave the country towards Europe\. MSF [counted](https://twitter.com/MSF_Sea/status/1126548794877804547?fbclid=IwAR3_RRD9GPe2RqCPdTijlGW9kV7E-0zayOWYKtJrTcyqsAF-u0KayEROfTE) 213 people who disembarked in Khoms, whild [Alarmphone](https://www.facebook.com/watchthemed.alarmphone/photos/a.1526182797655958/2362827043991525/?type=3&theater) recorded a pullback of 150 people\. Meanwhile, rockets are [hitting](https://mobile.twitter.com/i/web/status/1126611425663881216?fbclid=IwAR1nIRGCIh5s9Zwd0PpQbPOEhTyT9ysA3-m64ihbba-VxAf4eNfCSe6DDtg) close to camps\.

Back in Europe who celebrates its day and supports such ongoing atrocities, the situation regarding children and unaccompanied minors is absolutely unacceptable\. Many parents, teachers and school staff can not accept either the situation or the silence regarding the treatment of unaccompanied minors in France, many reports and stories confirm\.

In France, 341,000 minors were the subject of a child protection measure in 2017, more than half of whom were placed in institutions or with foster families\. Problem: the vast majority of these young people find themselves on the street and without resources, once they reach the age of 18\. Only one third of young people leaving the ASE \(20,900 people\) are offered each year a “young adult contract”, intended to allow the continuation of studies or better integration into the active life\.

However, nowadays, **even more minors are in the streets and unprotected all across Europe\.**


> According to the collective Jamais sans Toit, nine children attending school Michel Servet, are now out on the street in Lyon, after the cold winter days are behind us\. 





This is the real result and the real state of things in the European society, regardless of the drugs for masses disguised as sport and amusement\. 
While securitisation is still a policy decoy for nationalists all across the continent, especially ahead of the upcoming elections and particularly everyone living within the European Union, should look around themselves to see that for most of the people on the move this week only prolonged the troubles and added to the existing obstacles in the way to simply live their lives like anyone else\.
### Syria

For two weeks now, Russian and Syrian forces have targeted the rebel stronghold Idlib\. The air strikes and artillery shelling, including barrel bombs, a said to be the worst in months\. Hospitals and schools have been bombed deliberately, after the UN send these coordinates to Russian forces in order to not target them\. This, “is an unacceptable violation of international law\. Far too many lives have been lost, far too much suffering has been inflicted to the Syrian people,” [denounced](https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/62082/statement-high-representativevice-president-federica-mogherini-escalation-northwester-syria_en) Federica Mogherini, High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs\. Out of the population of three million people, one million are children, half of whom are considered Internally Displaced People \(IDP\) \. 150,000 have already left the region and analysts [say](https://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2019-05/syrien-idlib-eskalation-voelkerrecht-faq) that up to one million could try to go to Turkey if the shellings do not stop\.
### Greece

Following the protests on Lesbos in April 2018, more than 100 people went on trial this Thursday, AFP [reports](https://www.france24.com/en/20190509-asylum-seekers-trial-greece-over-camp-protest?fbclid=IwAR23mEGH6q465z7e_rppB9zmRtMnCF4McABdTbeLyHdpgjANXJ1ssifnYl8&ref=fb) \. According to the Legal Centre Lesbos, they face up to two years in prison \(which might be more comfortable than the conditions in the camp\) \. The organization criticizes, “a continued policy of the police and courts of Lesvos, Greece of criminalizing migrants who protest against their imprisonment on the Greek Islands, and the inhumane conditions in Moria camp, denying them their right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly\.”

The protestors had staged a sit\-in that was intercepted by far\-right militants who threw stones and flares\. Riot police kept both sides apart\. 26 protestors will have a seperate trial, which is not scheduled yet\.

There is also some good news: after seven days of being denied disembarkation on Lesbos, Open Arms can now deliver their aid\.

> I would like to give my heartfelt thanks for all the effort you are making in favour of my cause and above all the Mediterranean — and that people around the world become aware that migration is not a problem, it is our mission\. 





> When a person flees from their country because of a civil war or an extreme famine, conditions that make it impossible for them to SURVIVE, it is our obligation to reach out to them\. And to not build walls at the borders so that these people have to throw themselves into the water as the only form of escape\. 





> Between us all we can change things\. This is not a quick fix problem but by looking the other way we are letting these people die\. 





> Let’s fight for a better world in which we are all more empathetic\. Thank you very much brothers and sisters for your support, I am very proud of you\. A hug to you all\! 





Powerful words from Miguel Rolden, a Spanish firefighter who now faces 20 years in prison for the crime of saving lives in the Mediterranean, C [are4Calais](https://www.facebook.com/care4calais/?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARBSt9ss3pcRyOaNrW1oggNWC63p9FyJAirLIC2obG2afoO6LCRTfOwPb_f_Z5NCSKpgMcuunxWN4Xfkc2KKzX8OVRTrk4O3z7ZhWiAbfX9gNKtnDd9p-FL_7OsxMmdc7S3Yobvq6pCuZWsBtGaWXUgTFVzI-HXpJGLqkaVEclhzRKhHjfmKe6rbn6lIJ8f_97Uog3-7z_z28Ey_-kZC9WaW-58dWe45Ab9kdxHdfK1NJXWJf62v0d1Cv7k1qOyIsqWRzhBAoO2H0knC-fKpLSBx4KpD5kOCOK25-kIcBrcCvuL1lubfZ87oVruVGyt1mS2lvMKneTzOeB7z_PwqId0ZRBZs&__xts__%5B1%5D=68.ARCVhreAosAl01nc-m3Fk0Td7qtSDzNYfEWEaSIupf4HgNVJRx-EdwCwJHiR02VdOFpET00h5tVBZQqgr9XJUODneHICMP2kkKOSRvxrrcP0wfan6Eh8_iDeQ9J0dfvJ8kN628toml6TTyWOGPmqmfPI099rPIDo70QQX4i9K8aGQCAcYpr2hpruejG8PY1gIYaZt-QsQzHaCGwgO8rbcSCIZDYnssMb9lcc-lyZMDsqIAlxVfFXVgTHqrTcNcwy8B61rOPFcKV4Xxjzx_P_qahOrsxC9f2zaqU-KGYCA_W0bihWV-N2TJeYU1uox573p7epWtLcKZ8ayfO5_8oXgVY40ueA&__tn__=kC-R&eid=ARCndst5vCEyzkW0kuYYDWDsHPwrGMGRNV2cRFvHQZl65_DTTIlCEOe0ae45lBMrKSjbsD1gmO8jTuTU&hc_ref=ARTI8SYqKiDVOHP4nYf5BkSxsgiE8pxnY7WzoXDvkpbNhcMQw3BV6o5NMK4HqQRDzhM&fref=nf) reported\.
