### FEATURE:

In the last three days, 292 people in distress in international waters off the coast of Libya were saved by Aquarius, a search and rescue vessel chartered through a partnership between MSF and SOS MEDITERRANEE\.

After receiving authorisation, in its latest rescue, from Rome to engage in a rescue mission of a rubber boat in distress carrying approximately 122 people, the Aquarius, was ordered to stand down and give priority to the Libyan coast guard which was yet to arrive on the scene\. Following this incident, [MSF and SOS MEDITERRANEE have called on](http://sosmediterranee.org/three-days-of-complex-operations-in-the-central-mediterranean-sos-mediterranee-calls-on-european-and-international-authorities-to-urgently-clarify-framework-underlying-libyan-coast-guard-intervention/?lang=en) European and international authorities urgently to review and clarify the framework underpinning Libyan Coast Guard \(LCG\) intervention in international waters\.

■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 

#### A review of the incident:

At 10:32 a\.m\. on Saturday, both the Aquarius and the LCG were alerted about a rubber boat in distress carrying 122 people in international waters, 23–24 nautical miles from the Libyan coast by the Italian Rescue Maritime Coordination Centre \(IMRCC\) \.

The Aquarius arrived first on the scene at around 11:00 a\.m\. Despite initially being instructed to undertake the rescue operation, once on the scene they were instructed by the IMRCC that the LCG would be in charge of the rescue operation and that the Aquarius should remain on standby and not engage\.

While on standby waiting for the LCG to arrive, the situation of the seriously overcrowded vessel began to deteriorate as water began to seep in\. MSF and SOS MEDITERRANEE were able to negotiate with the IMRC and the LBG to allow the Aquarius to stabilise the situation by providing lifejackets and assessing the medical conditions of all the people on board\. Thirty\-nine medical and vulnerable cases were determined and given permission to board the Aquarius, including one newborn, pregnant women, children and families\. The Aquarius was prohibited from rescuing the remaining passengers\.

At 1:52 p\.m\. the Aquarius was ordered to move away from the scene, leaving dozens of people on the rubber boat\. The remaining people were picked up by the LCG and taken back to Libya\.

Following this incident MSF and SOS MEDITERRANEE have released a statement denouncing the current conditions of rescue operations at sea as unacceptable\.
#### Statement from MSF:


> MSF reiterates again that Libya is not a place of safety and under no circumstances should refugees and migrants be returned there\. MSF continues to call on European governments to prioritise the safety of refugees and migrants rather than actively enforcing policies of deterrence and containment in Libya\. MSF refers to the Dutch minister of foreign affairs who after her visit just last week stated that the situation in the detention centres is inhumane and they should be closed as soon as possible\. 




#### Statement from Sophie Beau, vice president of SOS MEDITERRANEE International:


> **_“The conditions of rescue operations at sea are ever more fraught with complications, as well as confusing and risky transfers of responsibility, which is unacceptable_** _\. Rescue vessels are forced to negotiate the evacuation of people in distress, the sick, injured and exhausted to a safe place on an arbitrary case\-by\-case basis, and in a tense and dangerous emergency situation on the high seas **\. Life\-saving assets at sea are becoming increasingly scarce and operations,at the same time, are being delayed, human lives are put at risk and rather than prioritizing their safety, people in distress are being returned to Libya,”**_ 





> _“We are neither lawyers nor political decision\-makers\. We are a European civil association of sea rescuers aboard an ambulance ship, which helps where people are in danger of death\. Since the very beginning of our mission in March 2016, we have consistently respected international maritime law, the maritime authorities, and worked while respecting the principles of humanity and solidarity on which Europe was founded, the DNA of seafarers\. **In the absence of a clear, public and transparent protocol governing the intervention of the Libyan Coast Guard in international waters off Libya, we urge the relevant European and international bodies to clarify the framework governing the actions of the various actors in this maritime area, which is the deadliest in the world\.** If this framework has recently changed and no longer allows us to save all lives in danger, if we can no longer carry out our mission safely, we believe that we and all other European citizens should be the first to be informed\.”_ 




#### SYRIA:

A video has surfaced showing the belongings of Ghouta residents being sold on the roadside by Syrian regime forces in parts of Damascus\.

#### An Easter message from Sea Watch:


> Easter weekend a year ago became a symbol of the failure of European Union assistance, as two civilian lifeboats had to make an emergency call themselves because no support came, although thousands were in distress\. The captain of the IUVENTA had to decide to let people drown or overload their ship\. Meanwhile, from omission, sabotage\. Today rescue vessels are seized for doing their duty under international law: to rescue people in distress and bring them to safety\. We urge the European states to respect fundamental human rights, including the _non refoulement_ principle, there is a right to salvation\!

### EU:

[In leaked documents, it has been revealed](https://m.theblacksea.eu/billions-for-borders/article/en/eu-turkey-meeting-leak) that major European Union member states have expressed dismay at having to pay their share of the six billion Euro Deal to Turkey to maintain the EU\-TURKEY agreement\. Instead of financing the EU\-Turkey agreement from their national coffers, they have requested the option of using pre\-accession funds or diverting cash from the EU budget to pay for the deal\. Originally negotiations were being made for the EU to pay three billion dollars to Turkey, however Erdogan insisted that the sum be raised to six billion euros\.


> The ‘agreement’ approved two tranches of funding at three billion euros each, as financial aid to the Syrians\. The first was to be spent by the end of March 2018, when a second three billion Euro would be available for a further two years\. 





> Pleased with the situation in Turkey, the EU announced this month that it is ready to release the further three billion Euro of its taxpayers’ money, the majority of which was due to come from EU member states’ individual budgets\.

According to Aegean Boat Report, 4977 people attempted to cross the sea from Turkey to the Greek Islands in March of 2018\.

59 boats made the trip = 2526 people

57 boats were intersected by the Turkish Coast Guard = 2451

#### FRANCE:
#### More cases of police violence against asylum seekers in Calais:

The French police have been accused of forcibly and violently ripping out a man’s hair as they took him out of the truck he had managed to jump in to try & reach the UK\.

**Faces Before Numbers warn:** “we can all imagine the degree of force that was used by the police to reach that result\. Direct & disproportionate use of force\. There IS violence in Calais & it is NOT an isolated incident\. It happens daily & it also happens across France as a whole \(Paris, French/Italian border…\) and our government, by refusing to denounce & condemn it, is allowing it to continue\.”

L’Auberge des Migrants reports that the number of refugees and displaced people in Northern France is steadily increasing\. In addition, emergency centres that were opened over the colder months are no longer accepting people and are planning to close\. This is pushing those who found shelter there over the winter onto the streets or into the woodlands\.

Furthermore they report that during the evacuation that occurred in March 31, the police had two water tanks removed from the street\. This means that refugees are forced to come to the state distribution of meals to access water which is far from the places where people are living\.
