### Feature


> No more EU\-Turkey Deal? 




[Ankara](https://www.dailysabah.com/eu-affairs/2019/07/23/readmission-agreement-with-eu-no-longer-functional-ankara-says?fbclid=iwar3bkygisvmcresrr2dirlpq0ctp4vlaahafuyxnjaa9ayzb2lfmx5vaadm) announced on Monday that the readmission‚Äôs deal signed with the EU in April 2016 **\(aka the EU\-Turkey Deal\)** is no longer functioning due to the EU‚Äôs inability to guarantee visa\-free travel for Turkish citizens\.

‚ÄúWe will not wait at the EU‚Äôs door\. The readmission agreement and visa\-free deal will be put into effect at the same time,‚Äù Foreign Minister Mevl√ºt √áavu≈üoƒülu said in a TV interview on Monday\. He also stated that Turkey will suspend its commitments to the deal\.

This deal has taken a toll on the functionality of Greece‚Äôs asylum procedures and the people stuck in between\. Refugees and asylum seekers must prove why Turkey is not a safe third country for them, more than explaining why they fled their country of origin, in order to stay in Europe\.

The EU\-Turkey Deal was criticized from the start, considering the multitude of human rights abuses and modern slavery tactics used in [Turkey‚Äôs informal labor market](https://www.refugeesinternational.org/reports/refugeesemploymentinturkey) \. Racists attacks on Syrian neighborhoods in Turkey have only increased with [the growing racist political rhetoric](http://www.yeryuzupostasi.org/2019/07/22/call-for-solidarity-against-increasing-attacks-on-syrian-migrants/) used against them\. Along with the intensity of [Syrians being forced to leave Turkey](https://twitter.com/InfoMigrants/status/1153645314764627968?fbclid=IwAR2t4593ZuM4lroW7o3s5HKQBnxwJ1jLVLzBYUnmGTCsilIYpG5judPhfN8) \( _more in yesterday‚Äôs AYS Digest_ \), Turkey remains as an **unsafe** third country for many people fleeing warn torn parts of the middle east and elsewhere\.

The Turkish government is making this decision from their critical foreign policy perspective of being the country hosting the most refugees in the world: [3\.7 million](https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/refugees-asylum-seekers-and-migrants/global-refugee-crisis-statistics-and-facts/) \. Yet this could also be a sign to European countries that their most self\-acclaimed deterrence policies, are not actually working\.

### Tunisia

[An update](https://www.lexpress.fr/actualites/1/monde/la-tunisie-peine-a-enterrer-les-migrants-morts-en-mediterranee_2091046.html?fbclid=IwAR3TznDBnB3E0B327L5x5kb0DOFXiCfXYg7nazOxNgGJOW5SyOc90eK4qUc) on Tunisia‚Äôs coast:


> ‚ÄúIn recent weeks, more than 80 bodies have been recovered on the Tunisian coast, between the port city of Zarzis and the tourist island of Djerba in the south of the country, a few tens of kilometers from the border with Libya\. All of these bodies were sent to the Gabes hospital, the only one in the region capable of taking DNA samples\.‚Äù 





This comes with the news that the number of refugees in Tunisia has doubled in just one year, according to a Tunisian NGO\. Most of the new arrivals have crossed over from Libya\.

> ‚ÄúAs we were informed about the inspections beforehand, we would tidy up the place\. We would remove the blankets of the ones sleeping on the floor\. The number of refugees kept in that center is well above the normal\. 





> ‚ÄúThey were keeping a woman with AIDS on a floor that they call ‚Äòhigh\-security floor‚Äô\. No one wanted to give her food because of her illness‚Ä¶She was not allowed to meet or see anybody, either\. They deported her afterwards, but I do not know which country she was sent to\. 





> ‚ÄúBut, generally, wardens would batter refugees in places where there were no cameras\. The battery could not be proven there, either\. The working hours of wardens are quite bad as well\. As they would work for long hours, they also became mentally depressed\.‚Äù 





There were many attempted suicides\. Some deaths were never investigated\.

> ‚ÄúAuthorities in the Western Balkans, namely Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania and Montenegro, have observed a significant increase in arrivals in 2019 and have registered a total of 11,461 migrants and refugees as of May 2019\. This is 40 per cent more than the 8,242 registered in 2018 in all three coutnries and nineteen times the 578 registered between January and May 2017\.‚Äù 





[A key source](https://www.facebook.com/groups/144469886266984/permalink/383852178995419/?hc_location=ufi) also tells us:


> ‚ÄúChallenges continue with regard to access to asylum\. After entering BiH, migrants have the right to register their intention to seek asylum ‚Äî doing so allows them to stay legally in the country for 14 days before they either formally apply for asylum or leave the country\. So far, since the beginning of 2016, only 1,600 asylum seekers have managed to register their claim, less than 5% of total arrivals\. \(Source: UNHCR in BiH\) \. The requirement of registering a temporary address in BiH is a key obstacle to this\.‚Äù
