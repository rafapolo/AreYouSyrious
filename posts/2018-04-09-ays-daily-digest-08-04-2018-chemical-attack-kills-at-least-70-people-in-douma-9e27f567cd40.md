#### FEATURE: Chemical Attack in Douma

[Over 70 people have been reported dead](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/04/suspected-chemical-attack-kills-dozens-syria-douma-180407202906316.html) in a chemical attack in Douma, the last rebel stronghold in Eastern Ghouta, near Damascus\. The actual number of fatalities is estimated by the white helmets to be closer to 100\. The death toll is expected to continue to increase as many people remain in critical condition in understaffed and undersupplied medical facilities\.


> “We are currently dealing with more than 1,000 cases of people struggling to breathe after the chlorine barrel bomb was dropped on the city\. The number of dead will probably rise even further\.” — Moayed al\-Dayrani, a resident of Douma and medical volunteer 





Most of the deceased were women and children, who at the time of the attack were hiding in basements and cellars from air bombardment, where poisonous gases are readily able to seep in\. Bombardment by Syrian and Russian forces increased in intensity last Friday after 10 days of relative calm\. The Syrian government has said they increased the offensive in response to shelling by Jaish al\-Islam on residential areas in Damascus\. However this claim has been denied by the Jaish al\-Islam rebel group, currently in control of Douma\. Douma is the last rebel held area in Eastern Ghouta\. Other neighbourhoods in the region have been evacuated after agreements were reached between rebel groups and Russia\. Just last week over 19,000 people became internally displaced and were evacuated to Idlib\.


> At 8:30 p\.m\. on Saturday, 7 April 2018
 

> A helicopter with the code \(Dika 427\) took off from Domeir airport and headed towards [\#Douma](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/douma?source=feed_text) in [\#eastern\_Ghouta](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/eastern_ghouta?source=feed_text) , carrying Sarin gas, and had been preceded by three helicopters\. It began to circle until the other three helicopters dropped all their weapons and entered the area of ​​Douma and dropped their load, which was sarin gas at 9:00 p\.m\. on Saturday 7 April 2018 





> It was a crime against our people from Douma, where about 100 children, women and men were killed and the number of injuries was close to 1,000 persons — Mahmous Bwedany, Ghouta resident 





The US government has warned of a global response against Syria if reports of the chemical attack are confirmed\. The Syrian Government has dismissed allegations of the chemical attack\.

[Negotiations regarding Douma](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/04/syria-chemical-attack-lungs-shutting-180408123716663.html) were said to be underway on Sunday between Russian forces and Jaish al\-Islam, as reported by thestate media and pro\-Syrian opposition Orient TV\. Currently over 100,000 people are estimated to be trapped there as bombardment continues\.

Syrian activists from Douma as well as activists from other parts of Syria are urging people to amplify their voices and break the silence on attacks against civilians by Syrian and Russian forces\. With very restricted access to the internet and no journalists present in Douma, it is very difficult to bring attention to these war crimes\. The only evidence available currently is coming from videos and photos taken by residents\.

> \+70 people, most of them children, have died and hundreds are wounded in a chemical attack in Syria today\. 





> They died silently\. 





> The world watched silently\. 





> Global teams who are responsible to make sure that this doesn’t happen, watched silently\. 





> When a terrorist attack happens in Europe or America, it is covered by all media\.
 

> They talk about it for many days, but you’ll not see this\. 





> Can you imagine if your child, brother or sister was one of the dead? — Abdulazez Dukhan

#### Advocates Abroad reports lack of sensitivity in asylum interviews by EASO

Advocates Abroad is calling for oversight to keep EASO officers in line, who, they claim, bully asylum seekers during interviews by asking difficult and disturbing questions with complete lack of empathy\.


> Welcome to [\#Moria](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/moria?source=feed_text) [\#EASO](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/easo?source=feed_text) interviews where interviews defy the norm of all humane, reasonable, and necessary questions:
 

> “Did he stab you with the knife in that wound or did he press the knife against the wound?”
 

> This applicant is a rape and torture victim, and sobbing throughout the interview, according to the transcript\. Who wouldn’t be? 





> Another stunning display of insensitivity: “Before you told me that the guard was ripping of \(sic\) your clothes when he forced himself onto you\. Were you allowed to put them on again? how can I imagine it?… What happened after the first guard got off of you?”

### Hungary

Yesterday was election day in Hungary\.


> [“If Jobbik gets into the government](https://budapestbeacon.com/gabor-vona-under-jobbik-the-border-fence-will-stay-and-a-border-guard-service-will-be-set-up/) , it will immediately inform Brussels about its position on migration: the border fence will stay and a border\-guard service will be set up; also, Jobbik rejects both the global migrant allocation quota suggested by Orbán and the mandatory quota of Brussels\.“ 





This morning it was announced that Viktor Orbán, who is widely known to be anti\-immigration, was elected for a fourth time\.
### France
#### **Strengthening protection for LGBT asylum seekers**

The [French parliament has voted in favour of strengthening protection for LGBT asylum seekers](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/04/06/french-parliament-votes-to-protect-lgbt-asylum-seekers-from-persecution/) \. With the new rules, 16 countries today considered as “safe”, won’t be seen as such for those seeking protection due to their sexual orientation\. In many of the 16 countries, it’s criminal to be identified as a LGBT person\. This will increase people’s chances to escape persecution\.

The new legislation is still a proposal, and has gained criticism for not being adequate for the protection of LGBT asylum seekers\. In some countries it may not be illegal or officially lead to a punishment, but may still be dangerous for the person\.
#### Waterproof shoes needed in Calais

Over the last two weeks Care4Calais has distributed 150 pairs of waterproof walking boots, but more are desperately needed\.


> Decent shoes are the prized possession of many refugees\. They live outdoors, they walk long distances every day, and having a sturdy pair of shoes makes an incredible difference to their quality of life\. They all desperately want good shoes but so many don’t have them\.
