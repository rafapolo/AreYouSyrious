### FEATURE 11,000 people are facing eviction in Greece because they are no longer eligible to stay at reception facilities for asylum seekers

According to [Info Migrants](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/25209/why-thousands-of-refugees-in-greece-face-eviction-and-where-they-can-turn?fbclid=IwAR32Eltn2L8TVMkU4JXrkN3gN_xRD-rpCIojmqZJztRGhqAB46LBqfcHyiQ) , _“As of June 1st, all refugees who received international protection before May 1, 2020 are no longer eligible to stay at reception facilities\.”_

Greece does not have enough space to hold these recognized refugees and house people who are still living in refugee camps on the islands who need to be evacuated\. There is huge concern for the looming homelessness for all these people, since Greece does not have systems in place to properly assist refugees once they are given protection\. UNHCR spokesperson Andrej Mahecic said last week:


> “Forcing people to leave their accommodation without a safety net and measures to ensure their self\-reliance may push many into poverty and homelessness\.”

The quarantine lockdown has ended in camp in Nea Kavala, northern Greece after many COVID\-19 tests came back negative\. The quarantine was first imposed after a woman in the facility came back with a positive test\. Doctors Without Borders said a quarantine for this long was unjustifiable and that vulnerable people should be transferred\.

#### MALTA
### France, Luxembourg, Portugal will take in “some of the 425” people who have been stuck outside Malta in ships for over a month

The European Commission made the announcement, but it is still uncertain how many people each country will accept\. The Maltese government had made an urgent appeal to other EU countries to help\. Malta has been breaking international law by not letting the people disembark and instead making them quarantine on ships currently not in use\. Some of the people on the ships have been there since April 30th, when they were rescued after distress calls at sea\.

#### GERMANY

Update by [Mare Liberum](https://www.facebook.com/MareLiberumOfficial/posts/644060972989476) :


> “A recent change of law by the German ministry for transport blocks our ship from operating and practically makes our missions impossible\! LIFELINE and RESQSHIP are also affected\. The official reasoning for the law clearly states that this law change was done specifically to impede the work of humanitarian organisations: yachts and other small crafts, which are operated in the realm of ‚environmental protection, sea\-rescue, including observatory missions or for other humanitarian purposes‘, now have to comply with such unreasonable safety requirements, which are not feasible practically\. 





> The simple aim of this new law is to obstruct our operations\. Apparently, the minister of transport, Andreas Scheuer prefers to see refugees drown, instead of them safely reaching European shores\. We condemn this insidious sabotage of our humanitarian work and demand the change of law to be repealed\!”
