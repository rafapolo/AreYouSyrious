### AYS News 7/12: Closed borders do not stop refugees from coming, but they make their lives terrible


> Closed borders, as research shows, do not stop refugees, but they make their journeys more dangerous\. A Kurdish refugee whose toes and part of the foot were amputated due to frost\-bites he got during his journey receives a prosthesis, yet another refugee showed up in Subotica community centre with bare feet\. New routes are becoming active: Croatia\-Slovenia, Morocco\-Spain, showing that with closed borders the geographical reach of refugee crisis has spread to more dangerous and remote areas

### Is Hungary really Western Europe’s gatekeeper?

In the beginning of November, on 3/11 to be precise, UNHCR reported that Hungarian authorities only let an average of 20 people daily cross the border, later they continued with that\. Before the number was around 30\. In fact the average number for daily arrivals dropped from 34,48 in October to 22,08\* in November\. But what did this mean to Austria? It should be assumed, that when Hungary reduces the number of new arrivals, it should have an impact on the number of new arrivals in Austria\.

In October 3060 made it into Austria, what’s an average of 98,7 daily\. During this period only 1069 had entered Hungary\. Concluding from this number one can assume, that on paper almost 2/3 of the refugees crossing the Balkans and arriving in Austria are not being registered in Hungary\. \* \*

In November the number of new arrivals to Hungary dropped by 40 percent to 641\* \. But this had almost no impact to Austria, where still 2761\* refugees arrived, what’s an average of still 92,04 \(decrease by ~10%\) \. The average of daily arrivals can vary a bit, the highest number on one day in November was 149 \(8/11 and 14/11\), the lowest 51 \(3/11\) \.

This means that on paper November 76,81 percent of the refugees had arrived Austria without being registered in Hungary\. In total the number remained almost stable, seeing that the number of daily arrivals in Austria can vary\. It’s only more people, who can’t try it legally anymore\.

\*UNHCR data for daily arrivals by now is only available until 24/11\. To that point 2209 refugees had arrived to Austria \(average 92,04\) and 508 to Hungary \(average 22,08\) \. If you add the average number to the missing days, you get a total number of 2761,25 for Austria and 640,52 for Hungary\.
- \*UNHCR only gives numbers for refugees along the Balkan route, not from Italy to Switzerland \(and later France\) or Austria\.

### The hotspots: Key findings from Greece and Italy

Almost one year has passed since the first hotspots were established in Greece and Italy\. ECRE published a study with the following key question in mind — whether and how implementation of hotspots is in line with EU asylum law and legal standards and whether it ensures that the fundamental rights of the migrants and refugees are respected\.
#### Key findings on hotspots in Italy

The hotspots approach in Italy has primarily served as a measure to better control migration and ensure Italy’s compliance with fingerprinting requirements\. The implementation of the approach however raises a number of concerns:
- Most disembarkations happen in non\-hotspot areas where practices are less clear and where the possibility to provide information before identification is not always guaranteed\. No mobile hotspots have been set up so far for this purpose, as suggested by the Commission\.
- Migrants are often not sufficiently informed before pre\-identification and identification about the procedures and the possibility to apply for asylum, or the purpose of the ‘foglio\-notizie’ form\.
- Pre\-identification through the ‘foglio notizie’ form is used to “filter” applicants for international protection butfrequently results in impeding access to the asylum procedure\.
- Information about the asylum procedure is provided mostly by international organisations, even if that remains the responsibility of the authorities
- There is significant lack of cultural mediators/interpreters in all languages, especially the Sub\-Saharan languages
- Medical screening carried out on board is not always coordinated with further medical examinations later on, and there is no continuity of medical care; medical information and vulnerability screening are also not always well coordinated\.
- Coercive measures, including physical force and prolonged detention, are used in the case of persons refusing to be fingerprinted\.
- In case of doubt, age assessment is conducted frequently through X\-ray examination and not as a method of last resort
- Clear referral mechanisms in general and specific referral mechanisms for vulnerabilities are not systematically in place\. The nonvisible and non\-declared vulnerabilities are usually identified at a later stage in the regional hubs, and the EASO vulnerabilities tool is not used systematically
- Detention in the hotspots tends to last longer than 48 hours, and is unregulated and arbitrary\. There is no access to effective remedy
- Unaccompanied minors are placed in hotspots despite the fact that this is against Italian law
- Vulnerable cases, including unaccompanied minors and victims of trafficking, end up staying prolonged periods of time in the hotspots as specialised shelter capacity remains limited
- In practice, unaccompanied minors have no access to relocation\. The timeline for appointment of guardian for unaccompanied minors takes longer than the relocation timeline, making the two incompatible
- The slow pace of relocation makes it unattractive as an option, with the result that those eligible refuse to be fingerprinted and prefer to continue the journey to another Member State through irregular means, rather wait\. Lack of transparency also lead to mistrust in the relocation programme
- Reception capacity in Italy still remains insufficient; facilities are often used for mixed purposes, accommodating asylum seekers outside the relocation programme and relocation candidates\.There is a lack of reception facilities close to disembarkation areas

#### Key findings on hotspots in Greece

The implementation of the hotspots in Greece paints a much more confusing and tense picture than in Italy\. This is a result of the EU\-Turkey Statement that came into effect on 20 March 2016 and brought about major changes to the administrative procedures in the hotspots and enormous pressure to the national asylum system as a whole\. While deficiencies and challenges in the Greek asylum system are still multiple, Greek reforms and developments are highly politicised at national and EU level\. This, combined with a tense security situation in the hotspots and legal uncertainty concerning certain practices, has led to substantial confusion and insufficient information at all levels, ranging from the authorities and organisations providing services to the refugees entering the centres\.
- The limited capacity of the Greek Asylum Service to process asylum applications in the hotspots leads to excessive delays and prolonged stay, both of which contribute to the deteriorating situation
- The role of EASO in the Greek hotspots has increased in individual decision\-making processes \(inadmissibility and in merit examination of claims\) and generates greater accountability and liability for the Agency; in practice, the division of labour with the national authorities is sometimes blurred
- The systematic use of the safe third country \(STC\) concept in the admissibility procedure risks undermining the effectiveness of procedural safeguards and access to the asylum procedure\.
- The practice of mandatory detention, applied indiscriminately, even to vulnerable cases, is not in line with legal standards and the EU acquis
- Certain nationalities are prioritised, while the asylum claims of others, such Iraqis and Afghans, are not examined; this differentiation creates frustration and inter\-ethnic tensions
- Reception conditions are inadequate and often below standard in the Greek hotspots
- Prolonged stay in facilities that were foreseen for a period of a few days is problematic and inappropriate, and one of the factors behind the deteriorating situation and the constant tensions
- The most vulnerable, such as unaccompanied minors, are those that stay in the hotspots the longest because the places in specialised shelters remain insufficient
- The lack of proper guardianship hinders the access of unaccompanied minors to the asylum procedure
- There is substantial confusion, lack of information and guidance to the camp residents about the procedures, due to frequent change of practice and the multitude of different and loosely coordinated actors present in the camps
- There is lack of clarity about the duration of their stay and their prospect of leaving the island for the mainland
- The number of interpreters and cultural mediators on the islands still remains insufficient
- Legal information and assistance is accessible, but as the needs have substantially increased, the capacities of local actors delivering such assistance, including civil society organisations needs to be strengthened
- There is no clear referral pathway in the identification of vulnerabilities by FRS/RIS and EASO\. Non\-visible vulnerabilities are often not sufficiently detected, while identification of trafficking victims is not included in the scope
- With the shift of focus of the Greek hotspots towards asylum and return, access to relocation is only possible from the mainland\. Relocation numbers are slowly increasing, but several implementation challenges involving all actors involved — the Greek authorities, EASO and Member States — still render the process slow\.

### Smuggler Gets 63 Years In Prison

A Turkish man has been jailed for 63 years and fined 400,000 euros after being convicted of people smuggling in a Greek court on Lesvos\. The man had been apprehended last year by the Greek coast guard while illegally transporting people from Turkey to the Agrilia coast, south of the main port town of Mytilene\. The severity of the sentence reflects the fact that evidence showed he had transported a large number of asylum seekers before being caught by authorities\. The courthouse in Lesvos is trying a long list of similar cases related to people smuggling\.
### A total of 115 migrants were intercepted by Turkish police Wednesday en route to Greek islands

The migrants, many ill due to the bad weather, were taken to tents near the harbor for treatment, where some of the children who fell sick were taken to hospital for checkups\. The police said that after processing, the migrants will be taken to Izmir’s Migration Management Directorate\.

Today, the closing of the Bicske camp becomes a reality, as 10 people are transferred to the tent camp at Körmend\. We want to draw attention to the miserable conditions in the Körmend camp\. It’s gonna be \-4 tonight in Körmend, and tent is the only thing Hungarian government could come up with for refugees\. This is how the government wants to make life impossible for asylum seekers, and forces them move on from Hungary\. From Körmend, Austria is just a stone’s throw away\.

### Germany fulfils its promise to take a lot more people through the Relocation program

In the last six weeks, Germany made nearly 1000 Relocation places available\. Germany is fulfilling its promise to take from September on at least 500 Relocation applications a month\. Also Spain \(405 new places\) and Norway \(211 new places\) made a big afford since mid October\. In total there are 2200 new places\. In the same time frame more then 1100 refugees have been flown out to their country of Relocation\.

### Afghanistan to continue accepting refugees that were rejected by Sweden

The Afghan parliament last week voted no to a bilateral agreement with Sweden, which said that the country would receive citizens that had been rejected unvolountary/by force from Sweden\.

But after the yesterday’s talk between Morgan Johansson and the Afghan Deputy Foreign Minister Hekmat Karzai, it is clear that Afghanistan will receive its citizens — even if they are expelled by force\. The reason is a general agreement with the EU\.

### Yet another asylum seeker has poured petrol over themselves and ignited it

[Vísir](http://www.visir.is/kveikti-i-ser-vid-husnaedi-utlendingastofnunar-i-vidinesi/article/2016161208992) reports this happened at the asylum seeker shelter at Víðines this afternoon\. The man was taken to hospital, and is reportedly badly burned\.

This is actually the second time today that police were called to the location to respond to an asylum seeker threatening to hurt themselves\. No injuries were reported at the earlier dispatch\.

Most disturbingly, incidents wherein asylum seekers set themselves on fire, due to long waits for an answer from the Directorate of Immigration or due to poor living conditions, have been prevalent in the news over the years\.

### Why Syrian refugees aren’t in Russia: Study shows Government denying almost all asylum requests

A scathing report from a Russian human rights organization says the government has blocked nearly every Syrian refugee’s request for asylum and has even gone so far as to declare the civil\-war torn Middle East country “safe,” [the Moscow Times reported Wednesday](https://themoscowtimes.com/news/human-rights-group-russian-authorities-dont-want-to-accept-syrian-refugees-56448) \.

Civil Assistance, a nonprofit charity [that helps refugees](http://refugee.ru/en/about-organization/) and “forced migrants” navigate Russian immigration and with legal fees, said in a study titled “Syrian Refugees in Russia” that from 2011 to 2015, 2,011 Syrians asked for permanent asylum in Russia and only one request was granted\.
#### EU
### The EU is still not ready to receive refugees in case Turkey fulfills its threat to unleash a refugee flow to Europe

Bulgaria has urged the European Commission to work on an alternative plan in case Turkey fulfills its threat to unleash a refugee flow to Europe, Foreign Minister Daniel Mitov said while attending a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Brussels\.

“We cannot base our policy solely on hopes, we have to be ready for any scenario,” Bulgaria’s foreign minister said\.

Mitov said that Nato should closely monitor the increasing possibility that the migration crisis could escalate again\.
#### Mediterranean
