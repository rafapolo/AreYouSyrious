### **AYS News Digest 18/08/22: 1500 asylum seekers and refugees forcibly displaced by the closure of Athens’ Eleonas camp**

Closure of Eleonas reception centre // further inaction on the Evros border // 17 people in distress near Lampedusa // an EU\-Morocco deal in the same vein as the EU\-Turkey one? // an increase in detentions and departure preventions in Tunisia and Libya // Tripoli’s flight ban violates international law // indefinite detention in Poland // Berlin airport’s deportation centre finds a dodgy donor // Frontex and EUCAP Sahel\-Niger sign an ‘operational partnership’ // Josoor forced to dissolve & much more

#### Residents of Eleonas camp will be forced to live on the streets\.

As reported in [AYS News Digest 07/07/22](ays-news-digest-6-7-22-rohingya-child-challenges-croatia-and-slovenia-over-violent-pushbacks-a12dcf649db8) , the mayor and Municipality of Athens insist that the initial emergency migration circumstances that led to the camp’s opening are no longer present\. What they have deemed necessary, however, is a new soccer stadium which will be built upon the former site of the reception centre\. The permanent closure of Eleonas will deny many individuals access to their schools, work places, and basic services\. Disregarding sustainable solutions to reception and integration, the authorities attempted to begin transfers on 16th August\. Met with protests from residents and former employees of the camp, the authorities are unrelenting and the eviction has been rescheduled for today\. The true logic behind Eleonas’ closure seems to be one of occlusion: an attempt to hide further those marginalised by the asylum system from the public eye, from social responsibility, and to push these people towards pseudo\-detention in more rural parts of Greece, away from Athens\.

#### **GREECE**
#### Greece’s reception of Ukrainian refugees highlights the politics of wilful inequality

About 7000 people have entered Greece from Turkey this year, either across the land border or the Aegean Sea\. Forced to take irregular routes upon which exploitation and abuse is rife, individuals arriving via such routes are met with divergent treatment to those arriving from Ukraine\. As many as 17,000 refugees live in Greek camps, and are reliant upon residence in government structures to access financial aid\. By contrast, 18,000 Ukrainians \(72,000 Ukrainians have entered Greece since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February 2022\) have applied for protection under an EU TPD, which gives people the right to live, work, and access essential services in EU member states for up to two years\. [Greece’s Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi referred to Ukrainians as ‘ _real refugees_ ’ in March](https://twitter.com/nmitarakis/status/1498621457005531140?s=20&t=Kg57eegZuB-4jOeawIN8Pw) , and the discrepancy in the efficiency and humane\-ness of reception in Greece illustrates that significantly different solutions to reception are possible\. Kleio Nikolopoulou, an advocacy officer and lawyer for the Greek Council of Refugees, says that:


> “\[They\] don’t want people \[from Asia and Africa\] to actually enter the country,” Nikolopoulou said\. “It is so frustrating to see how differently \[Ukrainians and non\-Ukrainians\] are being handled\.”

Hopefully BVMN’s prompt actions will prevent another tragedy such as last week’s, forcing the Greek authorities to act\. Indeed, Greek authorities claimed that those stranded on Evros last week had been ‘found’ after their four\-day ordeal— a linguistic choice that suggests the Greek police had no agency over the situation\. [Pushbacks have been reported in both directions](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/42664/migrants-stranded-on-evros-island-found-by-greek-authorities?fbclid=IwAR34v9Is3cery92y8SYDfnXQ3NaBuKb1H_NpsWtMU8Qn8azbHspuxQlpjco) , showing how such language reframes and misleads an understanding of the situation\. This linguistic gaming echoes the evasion of responsibility that both Turkish and Greek authorities justify through the geographical complexity of the Evros border\. Human Rights 360 write that:


> “When life is at risk, to claim that the area right next to your door does not belong to you and you claim that you don’t care for what is happening there, is just a pretext in order to evade your liability\.”

**Tunisia has intercepted 657 people at sea over the weekend**

There have been reports of 46 separate incidents between 12–15th August, with 657 individuals either stopped from crossing or rescued after their boats came into trouble\. As Tunisia’s economic and political situation deteriorates, more people seek to cross the Mediterranean to escape rising unemployment\.

#### Morocco is set to receive €500 million from the EU to control its borders against irregular immigration\. A new EU\-Turkey deal?

**AP/BERNAT ARMANGUE** — Migrants next to the Spanish\-Moroccan border

The majority of irregular entries into Spain come via Morocco, and the increased budget allocation \(2x what it was previously\) is intended to fund border control infrastructure and resources up to 2027\.

This prospective agreement comes just seven weeks after the Melilla massacre on 24th June 2022, [when at least 23 people were killed trying to cross the Barrio Chino fence\.](ays-news-digest-24-6-22-deaths-at-the-border-with-spain-44683109e846) Moroccan authorities have been accused of [instrumentalising migration](https://english.alaraby.co.uk/analysis/spain-and-morocco-new-friendship-inked-blood?fbclid=IwAR3zwquiwj235Dcdtjb-w3LFr_MKmRE3OKfs5_FUmmjIUlWsu5Z7HoX5lFs) by AMDH \(Moroccan Association of Human Rights\) to improve relations with Madrid — On 24th June, over 2000 people walked to the border fence for over an hour, observed but unchecked\. It seems that the excessive violence on the Melilla border has been welcomed enthusiastically by Spain and the EU\.


> “The Melilla massacre highlighted Morocco’s readiness to sacrifice its friendship with its African neighbours to gain the validation of a European state” 





> “The death of those young Africans on the European borders is a warning to us about the deadly nature of the Moroccan\-Spanish security collaboration on immigration” 





Those responsible for the violence and murders on the 24th June have still not been held accountable\.

#### **LIBYA**
#### [On Monday, the Libyan authorities reportedly rounded up and detained dozens of migrants in Tripoli\.](https://www.thenationalnews.com/mena/2022/08/16/libya-detains-dozens-of-migrants-in-home-raids-in-tripoli/?fbclid=IwAR1Xpin-Q_1AqtTbvFBv2DqB6IngiPyNJOQRLxA-7mpvcT10mjWNB-J2kDw) People on the move stuck in Libya are increasingly targeted as scapegoats for the nation’s problems\.

A police statement said that legal measures would be taken against those detained in Tripoli’s Airport Road area, and claimed that these raids are linked to an increase in local crime including prostitution, robbery and drug trafficking\. Proof for such allegations remains absent\.

**5000individuals \(at least\)** , **including women and children, were detained in similar operations last year** \. Human rights activists have long decried such detention centres, which are ‘ _rife with abuse’\._

InfoMigrants reports that the whole operation could be a cover up for the deaths of two migrants at the weekend, who worked as garbage collectors in the Airport Road area\. Tarik Lamloum, a Libyan activist working for the Belaady Organisation for Human Rights, told _AP_ that:


> “Most migrants in the area are workers in workshops and farms, not criminals”

#### Minors are being tried and imprisoned in Italy as adults, “while the real traffickers remain in Libya _”\._

_Il Fatto Quotidiano_ cites an ANSA \(Italy’s National Associated Press Agency\) report, detailing the stories of minors on un\-crewed vessels that cross the central Mediterranean\. The smugglers and human traffickers never board the boats themselves, whilst minors fleeing conflict and persecution are charged\. Watch ANSA’s report here:

#### POLAND
#### The Polish government continues to practice a policy of indefinite detention, often locking up those seeking protection before asylum procedures have begun\.


> “People are detained to prevent an alleged risk of absconding or to carry out an identity check\. Before they are interned, a Polish court must approve it\. But the court decides on the detention based on what the border guards say\. That’s very selective\. Those seeking protection are not asked about their reasons for asylum or about what they have experienced\. Their health situation is also usually ignored\. The judges only ask the refugees to confirm that they crossed the border illegally\. This is usually sufficient for them to establish that there is a risk of absconding and that there is therefore a reason for detention\.” 





Based on this preordained narrative, people are indefinitely held in prison\-like conditions where cameras are banned, valuables must be handed in, and access to the outside world is severely restricted\. Read the full interview with Maria Poszytek below:

#### GERMANY
#### The German government’s plan to build a €150 million deportation centre at Berlin airport has found a dodgy donor

The investor, Jürgen Harder, has criminal record for corruption, and stands to profit significantly from the construction of this joint deportation centre — what Brandenburg authorities refer to as a ‘ _authority centre’,_ consisting of a detention building and transit centre to hold up to 118 people\. The rental cost for a 30 year contract? **€759, 220 per month\.**

#### The Danish government has announced its plans to resettle 200 refugees \(explicitly not asylum seekers\) from Rwanda each year, based on the nation’s economic and social capacity to do so\.

InfoMigrants remind its readers that Danish immigration policies have become increasingly harsh recently\. Not only does this policy explicitly exclude asylum seekers, but in April Denmark sought to instigate a policy similar to the UK’s one of transferring asylum seekers to Rwandan soil\. In June 2021, Denmark passed a law that allows it to process asylum seekers out of Europe\. More [here](http://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/42689/denmark-to-resettle-200-refugees-from-rwanda?fbclid=IwAR0garPb0YiiT2xGK6l1FStawrRpSq8DQ1n3pNkCj9g7Z8yD6iRTY3zfsyA) \.

This follows news that the UK government’s policy advisors warned against its asylum\-exportation policy due to concerns about Rwanda’s human rights record, as reported by the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-62566194) \. A legal review of the UK’s policy will begin on 5th September, and this could well influence whether nations such as Denmark will continue to explore similar options\.

**FRONTEX**
#### EUCAP \(EU Capacity Building Mission\) Sahel Niger and Frontex have signed a new “operational partnership against migrant smuggling” in Brussels

Frontex will now be co\-operating with the republic of Niger along the country’s borders with Libya and Algeria, expanding well beyond Europe and further militarising migration policies through the externalisation of the EU border regime\.

Frontex are also due to set up a ‘risk analysis cell’ in Autumn 2022, in Mauritania\.

Josoor’s position in Turkey has become untenable, and this is a worrying example as actors on the ground become increasingly criminalised, and their residence permits revoked\.

**WORTH READING:**
- **FragDenstaat** — Freedom of information campaigners at FragDenstaat have found a way to make information requests to Frontex more transparent to the public\. Frontex’s online platform \(called “PAD”\) — controlled by the EU border police — is used to respond to information requests: these responses can be changed, and Frontex can revoke access to information, as well as access the data of those who request it\. Fragdenstaat has built a platform to automatically import data from Frontex, making Frontex’s data\-fence much more transparent\. It also identifies Frontex’s use of Captcha security as violating the EU’s accessibility directive\. Read more below\.
