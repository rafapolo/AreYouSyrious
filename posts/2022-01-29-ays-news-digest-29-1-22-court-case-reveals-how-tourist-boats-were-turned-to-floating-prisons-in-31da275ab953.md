#### FEATURE

A constitutional case against Malta’s government members has [revealed](https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/court_and_police/114618/tourist_boat_registration_changed_days_before_it_became_floating_detention_facility__?fbclid=IwAR3JjK0WekxYzXvKesj2GWtlRKXqA3BJMywQ52ioWdOMwlADEZOOSxwdph0#.YfUGYr3MK3I) how four tourist sightseeing boats were turned into quarantine ships described as “floating prisons” in only a few days, after Malta closed its ports in response to the Covid\-19 crisis\. Thirty\-two people have sued the government, saying their detention onboard those ships was illegal and constituted a breach of their fundamental rights\.

In 2020, over 400 people rescued in the Maltese SAR were transferred on three boats chartered by the government from companies Captain Morgan and Supreme Cruises, where they spent weeks in detention without being allowed to come to land\. They had no means of contacting their families or seeking legal advice, and were not informed about their right to apply for asylum, according to the lawyers for the 32 applicants\. The conditions on the ships were dire, with not enough beds and sanitary facilities and little access to medical care\. Finally, 425 people were allowed to disembark in Malta on 6 June 2020, after spending up to 37 days onboard\. They were immediately put into detention\.

A testimony by the general manager of Captain Morgan, Kevin Zammit Briffa, revealed that [people had tested negative for Covid\-19](https://ecre.org/malta-children-released-after-almost-two-months-of-illegal-detention-people-detained-at-sea-in-2020-had-tested-negative-for-covid-19/) before their offshore detention, calling into question the government’s claim that this was a necessary emergency health measure\.

■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 


Briffa also explained that the ships’ registration had been changed from “passenger vessels” to “workboats” just a few days before they became floating detention facilities\. With this new license, the ships could carry passengers beyond Malta’s territorial waters : they received instructions to remain 13 miles offshore\.

#### LIBYA
### New “female migrant center” criticized as a media stunt

The opening of a new so\-called reception center for women and children in Tripoli, run by female guards, is [criticized](https://libyareview.com/20728/opinion-female-migrant-center-opened-in-libyan-capital-a-media-stunt/?fbclid=IwAR3m6fuoOnqqRlweUFAtqnZco_EHzMvttDevauVWCCz39-MnHtvL6zjszzA) as a “media stunt”\. If the ironically dubbed “Abu Salim Shelter Center” was praised as “an improvement” by UNHCR’s Vincent Cochetel, this is seen as a farce in a detention system where half a million people are routinely abused, tortured, sexually violated, sold into slavery, starved and killed\. According to Amnesty International, people on the move in Libya are “trapped in a vicious cycle of cruelty with little or no hope of finding safe and legal ways out”\.


> “All of this is theater, and cheap propaganda for media gain claiming that the Government of National Unity \(GNU\) is interested in migrants,” said an anonymous official who attended the opening ceremony: “They brought media professionals, especially representatives of the international media, to send a message to the international community that the GNU cares about migrants\. They brought about twenty female migrants from African countries, put them in front of the cameras and began filming\. The women seemed to reject what was happening, but they were powerless\. Then they were taken to an unknown place,” he added to the Libya Review\. 





This comes as a UN rights expert has recently [pointed out](https://euobserver.com/migration/154222?fbclid=IwAR2yAIKuqhQk81oShZ-LSI34Zw_Igplqs4eC_QAemoWXFBbwNEvbr8Oyxog) Libya’s practice of forcing people across its land borders and abandoning them in the desert without water\.
#### POLAND
### Border wall cuts through protected forest

The new 186 km\-long wall that will stretch for almost half the length of the border with Belarus [cuts through a protected forest](https://www.thenationalnews.com/world/uk-news/2022/01/28/construction-of-polands-wall-to-block-migrants-cuts-through-protected-forest/?fbclid=IwAR32EKZ67WuyxD0IGIvzBwIgrqJUjCPkGsKdmD1mYuRTFQDLilkkqx71r1Y) and Unesco heritage site\. Activists criticize the environmental impact of this 5\.5 meter\-high barrier that will run through the Bialowieza forest, home to European bison and several endangered species\. The wall will cost 353 million euros\. Unesco and the European commission called for a proper assessment of the wall’s environmental impact\. Grupa Granica, on the other hand, criticized the wall as a useless measure that “stops only the disabled, the weak, the sick” and “doesn’t stop desperate people who are fleeing danger from trying to cross”\.
### A 13 year\-old hospitalized on hunger strike

Tiba, a 13 year\-old Iraqi girl held at the Biala Podlaska Guarded Centre, was [taken to the hospital](https://twitter.com/GrupaGranica/status/1486683197261946880?fbclid=IwAR1f8PaMSVSCAnW7eg6nNfpMt9h3ROVG2wdPPtADQI8LVA73uYZyugUG-y0) after several weeks on a hunger strike\. Even in hospital, while being fed with a sonde, she is being guarded by the border police …

#### GREECE
### Islanders challenge the government on new prison camps in the Aegean

Massive protests of locals on Chios and Lesvos are [putting into question](https://rsaegean.org/en/new-prison-structures-in-the-aegean?fbclid=IwAR2y27evhI9zzPei6TLb8v75Qx7eEKYtIoSD4ftoEa_zItuSb3SGxZrp8DI) the narrative of successful migration management promoted by the government over the construction of new closed camps on the islands\. In its submission to the 2022 Rule of Law Report of the European Commission, RSA has also [highlighted](https://rsaegean.org/en/asylum-and-the-rule-of-law-greece/?fbclid=IwAR2sYWKMP7GmYq5tSbE9ayqu2frKbiQIxBpINB6XR-TT_NsHE0Vz6TRLdzA) serious concerns about asylum and the rule of law in Greece\.

In the camp of Kara Tepe, on Lesvos, yet another fire [broke out](https://twitter.com/daphnetoli/status/1487129202612740101?t=_FwN9_HsLFFy43IVUR4YDg&s=19&fbclid=IwAR2E3tq58aot5FD9to7PkjZp3qiY21WRFm_YhobEIQPQOulsLwvLhFXGlpo) in a big tent housing more than 40 people\. This is the second fire to catch in the camp in two weeks\.

### Winter conditions make life difficult for people on the move

Due to the heavy snow that hit Greece, residents of several camps have found themselves without water and electricity for days\. At Schisto camp, residents had to [melt snow](https://twitter.com/rspaegean/status/1486771686728949762?fbclid=IwAR3Jz_Dj6AtopEpUVIUXOiQKvgKXgJgKQcN7wbF-ZKcxcCkNyPor3h2U1Gs) for drinking water, after the supply was cut for four days\.
### Students beaten in right\-wing attack

Two students of the intercultural high school of Evosmos, in Thessaloniki, were [attacked](https://alterthess.gr/epitheseis-akrodexion-kata-prosfygon-mathiton-ston-eyosmo/) and beaten by member of a neo\-Nazi organization\. One of the students has since stopped going to school in fear of being targeted again\.
### More pushbacks

Twenty\-nine people were stuck for five days on a strip of land on the Evros river, with the Greek government [criticized](https://www.efsyn.gr/ellada/dikaiomata/329603_toys-thymithikan-molis-meta-apo-pente-meres) for its slow response\. Among them were several children and a man with a serious kidney health issue\. Despite being warned early on about the people’s situation, the Greek authorities took so long to act that by the time they searched the island, the people had already been taken back to detention in Turkey\. They were violently beaten, especially four Turkish citizens who were in the group\. According to them, the police visited them on the islet the day before, but told them” that they are not welcome in Greece and that they have to find a way to return to Turkey”\.

At sea, 40 people, including 15 children, were illegally [pushed back](https://aegeanboatreport.com/2022/01/27/15-children-abandoned-at-sea-by-the-greek-coast-guard/?fbclid=IwAR1h6TX1qCeDebMa7s69WB6G6U4Q1HfWTYBh95y9htyrNPQdbV4OwnttIws) to Turkey after landing on the Inousses islands on 24 January\.

Over 117 people have [died](https://thecivilfleet.wordpress.com/2022/01/28/at-least-117-refugees-drowned-trying-to-reach-europe-in-the-last-12-days/?fbclid=IwAR0bCWfATsA8oHlUA-FCTxhG9wZlGvjt_5qRMHgecFA4n7dTHnNoQaypaFA) trying to reach Europe by sea in the last 12 days only\. After eight days at sea, the 439 survivors onboard the Geo Barents finally [received](https://twitter.com/MSF_Sea/status/1487043966973403139) a port of safety in Augusta, Italy\.

400 people have [tested positive](https://www.fr.de/rhein-main/landespolitik/hessen-corona-ausbruch-in-der-erstaufnahme-91264967.html?fbclid=IwAR3L_kpAKRPBjyUBrRlZxfMY1sSDevjT5_6B-12uewqZmldkH5ewz_8Mijw) for Covid\-19 at the reception centers in the state of Hesse\. This has led to [severe criticism](https://twitter.com/FR_Hessen/status/1487011439084720128?fbclid=IwAR3gRLBLYYv4uCdF1hY1idmetEJ_VB24twCEmTfm0-TNkqcIkXyM0YZCZTY) of the accommodation provided to asylum\-seekers and the vaccination strategy of the German government\.
#### EU & FRONTEX
### **1\.1 million people displaced by EU arms exports**

Over **1\.1 million people have been displaced by EU arms exports** , says the [“Smoking Guns” report](https://www.tni.org/en/publication/smoking-guns?fbclid=IwAR10gXqwNBXc1lcRlyy-6CcHqzpnjRNPaTSBjCmGaKbQB7dMb5KI2L1JcU8) published by the Transnational Institute\.

They found that the lucrative industry of arms and military equipment manufactured in Europe is widely under\-regulated and has a devastating impact on populations worldwide, contributing to the destabilisation of entire countries and regions\. European countries comprise 26% of global arms exports since 2015 : France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK are the top five exporters\.

In parallel to this mass displacement caused by European lethal weapons, the EU Agency for Asylum [announced](https://twitter.com/ecre/status/1487058850217922564?fbclid=IwAR3KfeWLgafDd_tU3a4QcX6dOelsvaFO4W-K2mpc0QoJDWbdjh5BpUnLLO0) that asylum applications are approaching the highest level since 2016\. Applications in November 2021 were the second highest in two years, with 71,400 applications submitted\.

Back in Europe, the EU biometrics “Prüm” system will probably be [expanded](https://digit.site36.net/2022/01/27/facial-recognition-and-police-records-european-biometric-systems-to-be-expanded/?fbclid=IwAR1f8PaMSVSCAnW7eg6nNfpMt9h3ROVG2wdPPtADQI8LVA73uYZyugUG-y0) in the coming years, creating a central European biometric repository and making it possible to query facial images across Member States\. Concerns have also been raised about the EU Commission proposal for an Instrumentalisation Regulation, which the [ECRE says](https://ecre.org/ecre-comments-ec-proposal-on-situations-of-instrumentalisation-in-the-field-of-migration-and-asylum/?fbclid=IwAR0LUF880e0oQ7U0f9-2JX7HRspdEk2HfC3cw8M1OtHsIbI3gu2gzYlhZPM) “expands and normalises derogation from EU law” and undermines the right to asylum\.

For a touch of humor : the [EU Commission says](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-9-2021-005530-ASW_EN.pdf) it is “not aware of human rights violations committed by agents of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency \(Frontex\)” …
#### BELGIUM
### Asylum\-seekers still shelterless in Brussels

“People seeking protection are still being abandoned on the streets,” [human rights organizations condemned](https://www.brusselstimes.com/brussels/203704/refugees-still-sleeping-on-brussels-streets-say-human-rights-organisations?fbclid=IwAR3ojFKQGQLlKclO9BRG0RNgZZbm1obYRQ2rFkuBVJi_Jv3fipyGEQqSoIU) in a letter to Belgium’s Prime Minister\. A recent court ruling ordered an obligation to comply with the requirements of reception of asylum seekers, which includes providing shelter and access to the international protection procedure\. Organizations say the government has not respected this ruling, and has gone even farther by refusing to provide housing for people who applied for asylum in another EU country\.
#### SPAIN
### Two alleged smugglers sentenced to nine years in prison

Amadou D\., from Senegal and Kate D\., from the Gambia have both been sentenced to [nine years in prison](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/38170/spanish-court-sentences-two-smugglers-to-nine-years-in-prison-over-migrants-deaths-at-sea?fbclid=IwAR2sYWKMP7GmYq5tSbE9ayqu2frKbiQIxBpINB6XR-TT_NsHE0Vz6TRLdzA) following the deaths of nine people, including two young children, on route to the Canary Islands in March 2021\. They received three years for “crimes against the rights of foreigners”, and one year per victim on counts of “reckless homicide”\.
#### GENERAL

The European vaccination campaign has not been inclusive enough of undocumented people, reveals a survey by Lighthouse Reports and the Picum network\. The survey covering 18 countries found that the United Kingdom and Portugal adopted “open and accessible” vaccination policies, whereas Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia’s policies were “explicitly exclusionary”\.

In an incredible [show of cynicism](https://thecivilfleet.wordpress.com/2022/01/26/fifa-boss-suggests-biennial-world-cups-could-give-hope-to-africans-so-they-dont-need-to-cross-the-mediterranean/?fbclid=IwAR0emIwXRBirTkwwUwpJqQmyXVNCmvZw6WHHyjJdeF2dDMbgcaGaHlS1hn0) , the head of Fifa Gianni Infantino told the Council of Europe that hosting the World Cup every two years instead of four would “give hope to Africans so they don’t need to cross the Mediterranean in order to find, maybe, a better life but more probably death in the sea”\.
