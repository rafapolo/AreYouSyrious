A couple of months ago, a little organisation called [Imagine](https://www.facebook.com/imaginecalais/) set up art workshops in the calais jungle\. [According to the project coordinator Lujza Richter](https://www.facebook.com/groups/refugeeworkexchange/permalink/595723970626040/) the wonderful art work by the residents finally has been used to make cards and calendars\. Have a look [here](http://www.assoimagine.com/shop) \!
### UNITED KINGDOM
#### Help Refugees UK

won a signification first step in their law suit against the British Government failing to take responsibility for 3000 additional unaccompanied children according to [the Lords amendments to the Immigration Bill](http://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2016/may/mps-to-consider-lords-amendments-to-the-immigration-bill/) , the so called “ [Dubs Amendment](http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2015-16/immigration/documents.html) ”\. The British High Court made a declaration in the organization’s legal challenge, which confirms that the number of children to be transferred under Dubs is separate from and additional to Dublin III transfers\.

[Help Refugees said](https://www.facebook.com/HelpRefugeesUK/posts/359639447730068) : ‘The Government already owed legal duties under EU law since 2013 to unaccompanied children with close family ties in the UK\. Dubs is additional to that — it is about the vulnerable and isolated children who have no family ties\. Many of these children are in desperate situations and at serious risk of abuse and trafficking\. With the blurring by the Government of the distinction between Dubs and Dublin, too little was happening on implementing the Dubs Amendment\. We hope that this much needed clarification will ensure more transfers of Dubs children take place urgently\.’
