### FEATURE‚Äî400 People Occupy Gymnasium in Paris to Demand Proper Housing

The number of homeless people in Paris is ‚Äústeadily increasing‚Äù\. The French capital has a brewing housing crisis on its hands\.

Yesterday, Thursday, May 6, at noon, some 400 people, including 350 homeless people and families with children, gathered inside a gymnasium in the 11th arrondissement of Paris to ‚Äúask the State to set up stable and decent accommodation for all the people on the street,‚Äù the activist group Utopia56 wrote in a [press release](http://www.utopia56.com/fr/actualite/cours-occupation-dun-gymnase-avec-350-personnes-sans-abri-a-paris) \.

‚ÄúWe demand shelter for all these people, families and minors who sleep in the street, because our network of solidarity hosts can no longer provide this accommodation‚Äù, Ma√´l de Marcellus of Utopia56 told [media](https://www.infomigrants.net/fr/post/32047/paris-des-associations-et-des-centaines-de-migrants-sans-abri-investissent-un-gymnase?fbclid=IwAR2U6jtFWOwhHY_EXfWJGEx6hx45NV7fhCnQXTMjgOGglcnRsKr6M7NtWhI) \.

The occupation is the fourth action of the [‚ÄúCollectif requisitions‚Äù](https://www.infomigrants.net/fr/post/29836/operation-requisition-quand-les-collectifs-parisiens-investissent-des-logements-vides-pour-heberger-les-migrants) , a collective of various groups organizing ongoing protest actions to raise awareness about the housing crisis during the pandemic\. Activists have carried out several actions over the past months in public squares, schools and gymnasiums, gathering together people experiencing housing insecurity\.

Between 200 and 300 of those now in the gymnasium are people\-on\-the\-move, with or without papers, who face extreme housing insecurity in Paris due to discrimination and the lack of adequate reception facilities\. There are 81 people in families, 26 single women, 22 people in couples, 136 single men and 72 minors\. Many are from sub\-Saharan Africa and Afghanistan, according to media\.

Selon la loi et les engagements d'@[EmmanuelMacron](https://twitter.com/EmmanuelMacron), l‚Äô√âtat doit engager la mise √† l‚Äôabri imm√©diate et p√©renne de 350 femmes, hommes et enfants survivant √† la rue.

In its press release, Utopia56 wrote that ‚Äúthe right to accommodation is a right enshrined in the law‚Äù and reminded the public that President Macron has made [committments](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/france-houses-its-homeless-to-combat-covid-19/1772011) to house the homeless during the pandemic\. The group noted that ‚Äú3\.1 million homes are vacant, including 400,000 in √éle\-de\-France and 117,000 in Paris, not to mention the many vacant premises and offices\.‚Äù

Still, no concerted effort has been made to solve the issue, Utopia56 says\.

‚ÄúDespite our daily alerts to the town hall and the prefecture, the number of homeless people in Paris is steadily increasing: including many exiled people who have crossed borders at risk, employees exploited with or without paper, faced with high prices \[for\] housing and the lack of reception facilities,‚Äù the group wrote in its press release\.

The previous actions of ‚ÄúCollectif requisitions‚Äù were occupations of a former nursery school in the 16th arrondissement at the end of January, the H√¥tel\-Dieu in mid\-February, and the Place de la R√©publique at the end of March\. While hundreds of people were housed as a result of the actions, [many of them have since returned to the streets](https://www.infomigrants.net/fr/post/29085/a-paris-des-centaines-de-migrants-dorment-toujours-dans-la-rue-malgre-les-mises-a-l-abri) \.

Utopia56 says it will remain in the gymnasium until the people have been housed\. The group also released the following list of demands:


> \- Unconditional and dignified accommodation until the rehousing of all homeless people 





> \- The application of the requisition law on housing and premises of large landlords 





> \- With the approach of the end of the winter break of June 1, the end of evictions, of any release to the street of people and families accommodated, and respect for the DALO law 





> \- The end of violence and discrimination by institutions in France and in Europe towards exiled people, the construction of a real reception policy\. 





> \- Respect for everyone‚Äôs fundamental human rights, including the right to decent, stable and affordable housing\! 




### SEA
#### 38 people rescued off coast of Tunisia

The Tunisian navy on Wednesday rescued 38 people from a dinghy ‚Äúon the verge of sinking‚Äù off the island of Kerkennah, in eastern Tunisia, [media](https://www.infomigrants.net/fr/post/32023/trente-huit-migrants-sur-le-point-de-couler-secourus-au-large-de-la-tunisie?fbclid=IwAR1EpLDjE39x6NKPUxv60Upl5CSibr5tZbjYYek0eDSD8RFT9E1pDKKkceo) reported\.

The people on board included six women, and ranged in age from 20 and 35 years old\. According to the Tunisian ministry of defense, the group said they left Tunisia on Tuesday night in a bid to reach Europe\.

[Another media outlet](https://www.nau.ch/news/europa/tunesische-armee-rettet-38-menschen-aus-gekentertem-boot-65922048?fbclid=IwAR2JRBK0X_uwEEh3brB4S1JCSYu8ThjjlLejelLRDkSYjvLqfyPtJCK9YKc) reported that the boat had ‚Äúcapsized‚Äù near the coastal town of Sfax, close to Kerkennah\.
#### Outcome of SeaWatch 4 mission

72 hours, 6 rescues, 456 rescued on board, 3 illegal pushbacks witnessed‚Äîthe sum total? A thoroughly exhausted crew who put everything they had into the mission and saw things at sea that no one should have to witness, let alone experience\.

#### Autopsy from El Hierro tragedy completed

Spanish authorities have [completed the autopsy](https://www.efe.com/efe/canarias/sociedad/las-ultimas-victimas-del-cayuco-de-el-hierro-murieron-la-vispera-que-los-encontraran/50001312-4530032?fbclid=IwAR3Qarjw7AaMgS0jVNExUcjd_MJaeDIHz_ZIUi_ox-z77fLjH0ACcy3wAYc) of the bodies of 24 people who [were found dead](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/31862/death-toll-in-canary-islands-boat-tragedy-rises-to-24) and drifting in a canoe\-like boat off El Hierro, the second\-smallest of the seven main Canary Islands on April 26 of this year\.

Among the 24 dead were two minors\. The few survivors on board said that they had spent 22 days at sea, according to media\.

If the news couldn‚Äôt get any worse: the autopsy results showed that some of those who died aboard perished only a single day ‚Äî at most two‚Äîbefore the boat was found by authorities\. Just 24 hours stood between these people and the whole life they had ahead of them\. 24 hours: that‚Äôs how long it takes borders to kill\.
### GREECE
#### Covid cases rise in Lesvos camp‚Äîand so do fears

The Moria Coronavirus Awareness Team \(MCAT\) has written that people in the Lesvos camp are ‚Äúvery cautious and scared‚Äù about rising Covid infections\.

#### Frontex to discuss Turkish ‚Äòaggression‚Äô at sea

The Frontex board will discuss in a Friday meeting the two incidents of ‚Äúaggressive behavior by Turkish vessels against Frontex boats in the eastern Aegean,‚Äù [media](https://www.ekathimerini.com/news/1160574/frontex-board-to-discuss-turkish-aggression-at-sea/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&fbclid=IwAR1EpLDjE39x6NKPUxv60Upl5CSibr5tZbjYYek0eDSD8RFT9E1pDKKkceo) reported\.

On April 26 and 27, Greek media reported that ‚ÄúTurkish Coast Guard vessels violated Greek territorial waters and made dangerous maneuvers very close to Finnish and a Swedish boats patrolling in the eastern Aegean under the umbrella of Frontex‚Äôs Poseidon operations\.‚Äù Both incidents took place off Chios\.

Officials from both countries described the two incidents as ‚Äúvery serious,‚Äù media reported, and briefed Frontex and EU officials on the matter\.
### ITALY
#### Sicilian mayor calls for European civil rescue to save those at sea

Leoluca Orlando, the mayor of Palermo, the capital of Sicily, told an Italian newspaper that ‚Äúthe time has come to set up a European civil service to rescue migrants at sea‚Äù in an interview on May 4, [media](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/32027/italian-mayor-calls-for-civil-service-to-rescue-migrants?fbclid=IwAR2wQoFVFYV-E_lkk71LNQJwB_htW0TR8abzKko2cvnl6l40y-7AiWcPSHo) reported\.

Orlando said the service could be called ‚ÄúRecs, the Research European civil service,‚Äù and could oversee SAR operations in the Mediterranean\. He envisions a collaboration between ‚ÄúEuropean cities, NGOs and charities, under the sponsorship of the European Union‚Äù and that such a service would replicate Italy‚Äôs Mare Nostrum service\.
### SPAIN
#### 23 people rescued by Spanish mission

News from the Med reported that 23 people were rescued by the Spanish sea rescue mission Salvamento Mar√≠timo off the coast of Almer√≠a, a city in southern mainland Spain\.

The boat, which carried just under two dozen men from North Africa, was located about 14 miles southeast of the Cabo de Gata coastline\. The men all seemed to be in good health and were taken into the Almer√≠a port and treated by the Red Cross\.
#### Joint report: Human rights violations on the southern border: the Canary Islands and Melilla

A joint report prepared by Ir√≠dia ‚Äî Center for the Defense of Human Rights and signed by 50 other organizations has been presented to the United Nations Special Rapporteur for the Human Rights of Migrants as well as to the European Committee for the Prevention of the Council of Europe Torture\.

The document is the result of an investigation carried out by international relations experts, political scientists, lawyers, and communications people and analyzes the migratory situation in the Canary Islands and Melilla in the context of the Covid\-19 pandemic\.


> A context of health emergency such as that produced by Covid\-19 does not exempt the fundamental rights of people from being respected in the framework of an arrest\. However, the Ministry of the Interior and the CNP have generated situations in which they have relaxed, without legal protection, both the conditions and the times of detention\. This fact has generated spaces and exceptional situations in which we understand that there are not only violations of the rights of migrants but it could also be understood that there are signs of crime that must be investigated in depth\.

### WORTH READING

Last September, when a fire destroyed Moria camp, two Germans who had won airtime on a game show used their 15 minutes to bring attention to the terrible situation unfolding on the island\. 18 million people viewed their video\. But little has changed for Milad Ebrahimi, one of its stars\. In fact, he still remains on Lesvos\.
