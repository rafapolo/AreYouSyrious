### AYS Special from Serbia, Turkey and Greece: Cubans on the move

_Though it is seldom reported on, hundreds of Cubans have arrived in the Balkans and Greece in recent months\. Often arriving via Russia, they have faced violence and difficulty in accessing asylum and have even been pushed into Turkey having never before been there\._

#### Cuban Communities Along the Balkan Route

Cubans have been present on the Balkan route for at least a decade, but numbers seem to have increased sharply in the past couple of years\. No data is available documenting this phenomenon, but it is increasingly visible to teams in the field as well as organisations providing legal support to asylum seekers in Belgrade\.

Eduardo Castano, an asylum seeker who arrived 5 years ago in Belgrade and was granted a subsidiary protection by Serbian authorities, states that getting refugee status in Serbia is literally impossible\. He waited for about 2 years to complete the process\. Having applied once and appealed a negative decision, he received another negative decisions and was granted subsidiary \(humanitarian\) protection instead\. He reports a general lack of understanding among the Cuban community in Serbia of what the asylum process is, but a fair number of people would like to stay and settle down in Serbia unlike other communities who use Serbia as a transit country towards the Schengen area\.

In Greece, [Cubans are not recognised as asylum seekers](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/11/30/cubans-struggle-to-apply-for-asylum-in-greece) , and even if they were to attempt to file an asylum claim, they must now do so either at a hotspot on one of the islands or near the Evros border, which is non sensical for someone who is not using any of those routes, or through Skype which does not have a Spanish service and is notoriously difficult to get through on, sometimes taking years\.

[On the 29 October 2021](https://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2021/10/29/cuban-migrants-zakynthos-police-brutality/) , approximately 85 Cubans accidently ended up trying to leave on the same plane from Zakynthos to Milan\. They were beaten, detained, and told to leave the territory without the opportunity to apply for asylum\.
#### Reasons for Leaving and Routes

Their main reasons for leaving [are the crumbling economy](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/11/30/cubans-struggle-to-apply-for-asylum-in-greece) — incredibly high inflation rates have lead to many people being able to buy basic goods at a decent price — and very high unemployment rates also very high\. Combined, these factors have meant hunger and civil unrest, compacted by a lack of political freedom\. After protests in July 2021, people who were filmed during the demonstrations, reported being rounded up, beaten and arrested\.

The infamous [dollar shops](https://www.reuters.com/article/cuba-economy-dollar-idINKBN27T1VR) are still running and fuelling divides among the population\. They tend to sell goods unavailable anywhere else\. Most workers are paid in pesos, thus they are inaccessible to them\. Meanwhile US policies, which shifted under the Trump administration, made asylum claims de facto impossible to file\. Previously, if a Cuban made it to the USA they could apply for a Green Card after one year and thus be able to work\.

Russia and Serbia are both visa\-free destinations for Cubans\. Most people fly into Moscow, and from Moscow take another flight to Belgrade\. Prices for tickets are extremely high: Up to 1200€, according to Eduardo, for Havana\-Moscow\. From there, they can take buses or trains to the Greek border\.
#### Pushed into Turkey from Greece


> They were torturing him…the officer was trying to drown him\. 




[Josoor and Border Violence Monitoring Network reported](https://www.borderviolence.eu/violence-reports/october-31-2021-0000-near-alexandroupolis-around-feres/) a violent pushback of Cubans from Greece, near Alexandropoulos, to Turkey on the 31st of October 2021\. 40 people were involved from the ages of 3 to 35\. They came from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Syria and Cuba\. The group of Cubans had never before been to Turkey\. They experienced multiple forms of violence including beating \(with batons/hands/other\), people being pushed to the ground, exposure to extreme temperatures during the car ride, insults, water immersion, being forced to undress, theft of their personal belongings including jewellery, reckless driving, and being threatened with Electric Discharge Weapons\.

They expressed the desire to seek asylum but were instead detained with no translators present, and were denied food and medical care and provided with inadequate access to water\. Once in the police station a police officer began insisting that one group of young Cuban men had come from Turkey\. They tried to explain that they had come from Macedonia but the officer refused to listen or to allow them a phone call or access to a lawyer\.

Having spent a night in the cells and corridors on mattresses laid down on the floor people were told they could go\. Approximately 30 people were loaded into a van and driven for four hours\. They arrived at another detention site described as a police station\.


> There were 3 vans full of people — one was grey, described as a prisoner transport\. The other two were white, and had seats on the left and right on the inside\. The 11 Cubans, and 3 Syrians \(who were pretending to be Cubans, hence why they were placed with the Cubans\) were put inside the grey prisoner transport\. These Syrians did not speak Spanish, but they spoke English\. The Syrians were explaining to the Cubans that they will all be pushed back to Turkey, as they could tell the Cubans were stressed\. For these three Syrians, it was the 3rd time they had been pushed back\. While the other 20–25 people — Afghan, Syrian, Pakistani — were split between the other two white vans\. 





> In total, there were between 60–70 people in these vans\. 





From here they were driven to a military area surrounded by a cement wall and could see the other people who had been in the vans through the window screens:


> “Everybody was naked” exclaimed one of the respondents\. They had been forced to take off their clothes, and they could see people were hit by officers as they entered the building\. The group … saw a pile of clothes and jackets at the door\. Some of the people in the building who were stripped naked, were also beaten by these officers, as remarked by the respondents\. After people inside the building were beaten, they were ordered to put their clothes back on and put in another van\. 





The vanload of people who were mainly Cuban went through the same process the only exception being the Cuban family with the 3 year old and the Cuban women\.


> “If you were not Christian, you were treated bad\.” 




All of the others were beaten and forced to undress inside a large room\. They were allowed to put their clothes back on afterwards but not their jackets or shoes\. The two women were allowed their shoes\. They were then loaded back into a dark van with no seats and driven for another 30 minutes\. When they stopped, another 30 people were already gathered there\.

Out of the van they were split into small groups\. They were taken down to river by officers wearing Balaklava's\.


> At one point there was a pile of shoes on their walk alongside the dirt road\. If anyone was still wearing shoes, they were made to take their shoes off\. Only the women were allowed to keep theirs\. 




At the river, a young man of approximately 20 years old, was begging the officers to be allowed to stay and was hit in the face with a wire\. The same officer dragged the boy to the edge of the river where it looked like he was trying to drown him before he was stopped by another officer\.

People were put into two lines and loaded into the boat, 8 at a time, with two officers, who may have been Greek or Turkish, staying in the boat\. They were only taken part way across and had to walk for ten minutes before crossing another part of it where the water came up to their chests\. Eventually, they found themselves in Turkey and made their way to Istanbul, the only place they had ever heard of\.
