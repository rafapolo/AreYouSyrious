### FEATURE: Spain‚Äôs Minister of the Interior, Fernando Grande\-Marlaska, stated that the Canary Islands ‚Äúwill not become‚Äù the new Lesvos

This announcement comes as concerns rise over the significant increase in new arrivals recently on the islands\. A total of [1,347 people](https://www.niusdiario.es/sociedad/inmigracion/defensor-inspecciona-sorpresa-campamento-arguineguin_18_3044220374.html?fbclid=IwAR1m2gvp_1a1ikUgO57VKFtbwb7uDBORv3cnFOyiHPxwDbFEemqYR2-EmSo) arrived just this weekend and 86 people arrived on Monday\. Human Rights Watch and the CIE control judge of Gran Canaria have criticized the Arguinegu√≠n dock camp for its overcrowded conditions\. [Grande\-Marlaska said](https://www.europapress.es/islas-canarias/noticia-marlaska-asegura-migrantes-no-permanecen-arguineguin-mas-72-horas-garantiza-canarias-no-sera-lesbos-20201116104516.html?fbclid=IwAR1nnTekIwBRYtXJENLIcxU8enIXP7XZ60fTv_UZYGcHi9eoRr28AgN7exk) :


> ‚ÄúThis is an extraordinary situation, of urgency where something that has happened in Europe that has been the pandemic has had its transfer to the countries of origin and transit where they are experiencing an absolutely serious health and economic situation\.‚Äù 




His main point of ‚Äúguarantee‚Äù is that people do not stay on the Arguinegu√≠n dock \(Gran Canaria\) for more than 72 hours\. However, according to judge D√≠az Tejera, some people have spent up to 24 days sleeping on the ground with no change of clothes\. The Spainish news site Nius Diario reported that ‚ÄúThe high number of arrivals in the last week has meant that this camp has reached five times the number of people for which it was designed without enough tents to offer a roof to all its occupants\.‚Äù

The Ministry of the Interior did announce the intention to replace this ‚Äútemporary‚Äù camp with a new one in Barranco Seco \(one that the army is already building\) \. But what is to stop that camp becoming a more permanent Moria? The situation on the Canary islands is certainly worsening due to COVID and AYS will continue to bring you important updates\.

#### GREECE
### Greek media released new evidence of violence and pushbacks of arrivals at the Mytilene Port Authority

A report and video from the [‚ÄúJournal of the Editors‚Äù](https://www.stonisi.gr/post/12981/vinteo-deixnei-epanaprowthhsh-video?fbclid=IwAR343ShnZlFQrpY7JxSf0UH_RMF2HxR1VjHrUeBuZYxCS2Y62MiO8Bfdmgo) shows one of 30 refugees being ‚Äúrepatriated through an unknown process\.‚Äù The report concerns the events that were said to have taken place on November 3rd:


> ‚ÄúAccording to a refugee testimony in the ‚ÄúEfimerida Syntakton‚Äù \(his data is available to the newspaper\), after /several/ hours a group of about 10 men riding in an SUV arrived at the scene\. They confiscated their mobile phones, papers and wallets, put them in a van, drove them miles away and, beating them violently, boarded /onto/ an inflatable life raft, rescue raft which they towed in the middle of the sea and abandoned\.‚Äù

### ABR: The Greek Coast Guard performed 16 illegal pushbacks this month

They involved 374 people being denied their basic human rights:


> ‚ÄúSix of these pushback cases was performed by using rescue equipment/life rafts, where 161 people, children, women and men were placed in a total of 10 life rafts, and left helplessly drifting at sea\. Many of these people were picked up on the Greek Aegean islands, after they had already arrived, transported by vessels from the Hellenic coast guard back to sea and forced onto these tent\-shaped rafts\. In a normal world people are rescued from life rafts, and not forced onto one and left drifting\. No measures have so far been taken by the EU to try to stop this illegal practice by the Greek government, even though they have received overwhelming amounts of evidence\.‚Äù 





We will continue to cover the developing story of the father who has been charged for the death of his 6\-year\-old while crossing to Samos\. The story was covered in [the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/nov/16/father-faces-criminal-charge-over-sons-death-in-migrant-boat-tragedy?fbclid=IwAR1-4Rf3iqo8Jf7YwUkt5aPBQpws_FGtammrZi_-eJJyrUeNosOKnSymUYA) on Monday and Vassilis Kerasiotis, lawyer and director of HIAS Greece, gave a great explanation as to why this decision is unprecedented:


> ‚ÄúIn other cases of shipwrecks that have happened since 2015, including those resulting in deaths, we never witnessed criminal charges being pressed on asylum seekers during their entrance in the country\. This time we have charges for exposing an underage \[person\] to danger that resulted in death ‚Ä¶ We have witnessed such charges pressed for the same reasons at refugee camps in the country before, but never before at an entry point\. So this clearly signifies a shift of approach\.‚Äù

Researcher [Tihomir Sabchev](https://twitter.com/TihomirSabchev/status/1328321162670186496) gave an important reminder:


> ‚Äú **One year ago the Greek Prime Minister presented the ambitious ‚ÄòNo Child Alone‚Äô plan for unaccompanied refugee minors in Greece\.** Today no one still knows what staff the Flag of Greece Special Secretary for UAM has, what budget it has or what exactly is its plan\. 





> Only about 1600 UAM are in some type of long\-term accommodation across Greece, more than 1000 are in insecure conditions with little known about their whereabouts, more than 100 in ‚Äòprotective custody‚Äô which has been considered a human right violation by the ECtHR in the past‚Ä¶Finally, only 460 UAM have been relocated to other EU countries since March 2020, despite the initial announcement of 1,600 places\.‚Äù 




#### ITALY
### A total of 58 people landed on Lampedusa on Monday

According to Italian media ‚Äú _A boat carrying 58 people was intercepted by the men of the Coast Guard and the Port Authority\. The migrants, including 25 women and 5 minors , were all taken to the hotspot in the Imbriacola district, where there were already 627 guests\.

#### SPAIN
### French Law Enforcement is redoubling their staff along the Franco\-Spanish border

They are using their increased staff to check on trains and provide more ‚Äúsurveillance of steep paths\.‚Äù This is in direct response to Spain being under more pressure due to the increase of new arrivals on the Canary islands and the Nice attack on October 29th\.

El Pais is reporting that ‚Äú _The Constitutional Court will support in the plenary session that begins tomorrow the hot returns or rejections at the border regulated in the Citizen Security Law approved by the PP Government in 2015\.

Update from Info Park about the general situation in Serbia:


> ‚ÄúDespite significantly colder weather, the number of refugees and migrants in the Savamala area remains high with more than 600 persons in the parks and nearby streets in the evenings\. Due to obligatory two\-week quarantine for all newly arrived people on the move, a number of refugees, among them a few families with small children, refuse to be accommodated in the government\-run centers and opt to keep sleeping outside or search for alternative accommodation \(abandoned houses or smuggler‚Äôs places\) \. 





> OSP Miksaliste had to close its doors for new arrivals last week over a positive coronavirus case\. Admitting newly arrived persons was suspended as the premises were thoroughly cleaned and disinfected\. The Serbian Commissariat for Refugees and Migration \(SCRM\) and other organizations gathered at OSP Miksaliste have now resumed their regular activities albeit in reduced capacity\. 





> A volunteer\-run organization assisting refugees and other displaced people across Europe, Collective Aid, opened their office at Zeleni Venac providing hot showers and laundry services for all refugees and migrants\. To avoid potential crowds, the beneficiaries should first set the appointment via Viber or WhatsApp and receive further instructions\. A special time slot has been secured for women and children\. 





> **As a record\-breaking wave of coronavirus cases continues in Serbia, medical services for refugees and migrants sleeping rough are still lacking\.** The only available medical services are in reception and asylum centers, which are often remote\. As a result, the refugees can only contact emergency services, which have seriously reduced their capacities during the pandemic, thus making their access to medical services seriously reduced or hardly available\. There are cases when the ambulance refuses to provide help to migrants with evident symptoms of COVID\-19, while institutions responsible for migration management have no available mechanisms to force them to react\.‚Äù

- Police violence and incidents of rape at the Croatian border
- Organised pushbacks from inland Greece

### Amnesty International on the EU‚Äôs response to reports of violence against migrants at Croatia‚Äôs borders


> ‚ÄúAmnesty International with the attached complaint enabled the opening of the European Ombudsman‚Äôs investigation against the European Commission \(EC\), due to documented violence against migrants at Croatian borders\. 





> Jelena Sesar, AI researcher for the Balkans and the European Union \(EU\), claims that the EC was too tolerant of reports of abuse of migrants by the Croatian police, and as she calls them, uniformed persons from Croatia\. ‚ÄòThe EC has tolerated reports and allegations of violations of rights and abuse at Croatian borders to the extent that there is a significant risk that the Commission will be accused of encouraging and enabling further violence by such behavior,‚Äô Cesar told Radio Free Europe \(RFE\) \.‚Äù
