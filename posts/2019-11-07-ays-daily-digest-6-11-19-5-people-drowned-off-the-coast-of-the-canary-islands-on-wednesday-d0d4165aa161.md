Five [people drowned](https://rp-online.de/politik/ausland/mindestens-fuenf-fluechtlinge-vor-kanaren-insel-lanzarote-ertrunken_aid-46993205?fbclid=IwAR17mCK_CIwcb635x9DQ_XiDJtxNGKW1bHZyKJ34l0K21EQGUX-bjmhXNas) off the coast of the Canary islands on Wednesday\. Fifteen people were on board when their ship capsized; four were saved and six were missing at first\. The Canary islands are about 100 kilometers off Morocco’s Atlantic coast\. [As one journalist notes](https://twitter.com/lorenzodago/status/1192196677173743617?fbclid=IwAR0dDIZZ-IvDKCFy4pzQUhiijBEGC9TFcHzKmcbYQvaxIRvIuxVn29LODUM) :

### Libya

[The UN](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-50302602) now has reason to believe that Egyptian or Emirati fighter jets bombed Tajoura migrant center in Libya on 2 July\. 53 people were killed and 130 were injured\. This could amount to a war crime\. Reports add:

In her Statement to the United Nations Security Council on the Situation in Libya, pursuant to UNSCR 1970 \(2011\), the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court observed:


> “At the outset, I must observe with serious concern that there has been an escalation of violence in Libya over the reporting period\. Reports indicate that there have been a high number of civilian deaths, thousands of persons internally displaced, and a sharp increase in abductions, disappearances and arbitrary arrests across Libya\.”

In fact, they will try to return 10,000 people to Turkey by the end of 2020\.


> “Those \(who\) have entered illegally and are not entitled to asylum cannot move around the country uncontrollably and have no other choice but to return \(to Turkey\),” government spokesman Stelios Petsas said on Tuesday\. 





Reports indicate there will be centers on the islands and the mainland and are likely to be former military camps, capable of facilitating many thousand people\.

[On Wednesday](https://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2019/11/06/greece-migration-explosive-ep-committee/) the Greek Minister for Citizen Protection, Michalis Chrysochoidis, told the Committee for Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs of the European Parliament that the situation on the islands is


> “explosive and beyond any manageable capacity” 




He added further _: “Even if the entire EU mechanism is mobilized \(it couldn’t manage this\) tsunami of people…doctors or asylum officers are faced with hundreds of arrivals every day and of course not being able to respond\.”_ But still urged the EU member states to take action, particularly to help unaccompanied minors\.

[According to a new study](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/20642/680-000-irregular-migrants-in-italy-after-security-decree-study-finds) , 680,000 people are living as undocumented immigrants in Italy, an increase from “Salvini’s decree\.” Less than 500,000 people were living undocumented in 2017:

Why?
▶ Harder for asylum seekers to get stay permit
▶ Many people still stay w/o stay permit

### France

On Wednesday Prime Minster Philippe, revealed new migration measures as President Macron’s administration is trying to tighten migration policy, feeling pressure from the political right\. Philippe said:


> “It’s about sovereignty\. We have to take back control of our migration policy…\(it will be a\) fair balance between rights and obligations\.” 





They are planning to add fixed migration quotas, but didn’t elaborate\. Read more [here](https://www.france24.com/en/20191106-live-french-pm-unveils-immigration-plan-as-government-moves-to-implement-quotas?fbclid=IwAR2LPBMJhmWAJL9bSooqrIB1fVFBIYIcCZPn0kbfJDrMLW7yt3i5bKOzq5A) \.

### EU

In a co signed document by UNHCR, IOM, Red Cross EU, ECRE, and many more organizations, they acknowledge that the Multi\-Annual Financial Framework \(MFF 2021–2027\) negotiations are happening under strenuous conditions\. They are worried that ongoing negotiations might delay or create gaps in funding for asylum seekers and refugees, which is why member states need to still invest in their own national budgets\. T [hese organizations reiterate the following concerns:](https://www.ecre.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/EPAM-Statement-AMF.pdf?fbclid=IwAR02KxTUBfwyHGojzgidi4qd1W8Z6VCcftM58e0Y23hLi1_aBKrKHgJtGqc)

**I\.** Addressing vulnerability and ensuring protection
**II\.** Safeguarding policy coherence in non\-EU countries 
**III\.** Implementing partnerships with CSOs in practice 
**IV\.** Ensuring coordinated and significant resources to integration
