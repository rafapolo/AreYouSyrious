In the context of a global pandemic, armchair activism has finally found it’s place, one of the few tools left to us until restrictions are lifted\. Even under these conditions we will not and cannot be silent\.

Meagre rations for people relocated to Malatya refugee camp in Turkey\. Those evicted from [Pazarkule](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/pazarkule?epa=HASHTAG) have been transferred to closed camps in the cities near the Syrian border and they fear deportation to Syria\.

SEA

[Salvamento Marítimo](https://twitter.com/salvamentogob) spent the weekend searching for three boats that left Dajla, in Western Sahara, for the Canary Islands on Friday\. They have [spotted two boats](https://www.eldiario.es/canariasahora/365diasmigraciones/Salvamento-Maritimo-localiza-Gran-Canaria_6_1011108886.html) carrying around 60 people and at least one has been rescued\.

[The Moria Corona Awareness Team](https://www.facebook.com/MoriaCoronaAwarenessTeam/posts/118475256448320) published their multi\-language update on the Covid\-19 situation on the island \(click on the link above for Arabic, French and Farsi\):


> COVID\-19 update: 





> The 76\-year\-old woman who was admitted to hospital last Thursday afternoon, died today due to complications caused by the coronavirus\.
 

> Coronavirus statistics at Lesvos:
 

> 1 healthy\. 3 sick\. 1 dead\. 





Overcrowding, lack of access to water, unhygienic and unsanitary conditions — the well\-known situation of the camp makes it impossible for the people stuck in Moria to follow the basic Covid\-19 prevention rules\.

As shown in this [video](https://www.facebook.com/MoriaCoronaAwarenessTeam/videos/596581584551472/?v=596581584551472) , Greek authorities have installed one medical container to report suspected cases of Covid\-19\. One single container for over 20,000 people, and some Greek media [reported it as a great achievement](https://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2020/03/28/moria-coronavirus-medical-center/#.Xn95zA2v6vs.facebook) …

In the meanwhile, the Moria Corona Awareness Team have organised [rubbish collection groups](https://www.facebook.com/MoriaCoronaAwarenessTeam/videos/211479166793937) within and around the camp, and they are suggesting to all the residents to [minimise unnecessary contact with the rest of the island](https://www.facebook.com/MoriaCoronaAwarenessTeam/videos/2827024794071135/?v=2827024794071135) to avoid spreading the virus within the camp\.

On Saturday another fire broke out in the olive grove outside the camp\.

Fire destroyed two tents, damaged more.

Thankfully no one was hurt, they say.
The residents were again mostly on their own to stop the fire.

CHIOS

The [Chios People’s Warehouse](https://www.facebook.com/chiospeopleskitchen/posts/754918718370002) , despite being the victim of an arson attack in early March, is still supporting people stuck on the island\. Strict isolation measures have been put in place to protect the island’s population from the coronavirus\.
As a result, the kitchen is no longer able to cook and provide hot meals\. However, they have adapted to the changing circumstances and continue to operate by delivering dry and fresh food packages that enable people to cook for themselves\. They have distributed 100 bags of food to refugee families over the past ten days and they will start delivering fresh fruit to unaccompanied minors housed in the camp over the next few days\.

RHODES

[Solidarity Groups in the Dodecannese Islands](https://www.facebook.com/groups/DodecaneseSolidarity/) reported that racist far\-righters on Rhodes were planning attacks against refugees on the island, taking advantage of the movement restriction imposed due to the spread of coronavirus\. Read more [HERE](https://racistcrimeswatch.wordpress.com/2020/03/29/1-986/) \(in Greek\) \.

PATRAS

[No Name Kitchen](https://www.facebook.com/NoNameKitchenBelgrade/posts/947980018933616) are still active on the ground\. Despite having only one volunteer in Patras since the beginning of the lockdown, they have visited the squats in the port area every day\. They are working with a student from Patras helping in the field and their local partner KINISIS who helps during distributions at the factories, and provided masks, gloves and advice\.


> All our work stands in the terms of preventing SARS\-CoV\-2 \(Corona\) to spread into the squats and to the people we visit\. We’re are still taking care of around 200–210 people a week, with distributing food, sanitary items, medical care and solidarity\!
 

> Our work is done wearing gloves and masks these days and changing them every time we visit a different spot\. That creates a greater distance from the people we usually quite close to but that’s what has to be done\. 





They distribute soap, shower gel and shampoo, set up washing stations, and measure temperatures of those living in the squats\.


> \[On Saturday 28th,\] the first person we were treating showed an increased temperature and was therefore told to stay isolated from the other people while we supported him\. After consultation with the doctor from our local partner KINISIS we were told to observe the situation and will measure the temperature again on Sunday\. At the time, we are working on a way to get him tested for Covid\-19\.
 

> Fortunately thanks to our good relationship to the people we always have friends living in the squats who help us translating and making sure our suggestions are taken dead serious\. 





They continue treating around 20–30 people per day for problems caused by living in unsafe conditions in abandoned factories and for injuries caused by police and security companies\.


> Unfortunately there were at least three accidents at the port side, with people being met by the absolute disproportionate action of the police\. Which means that police and commandos at the port are still beating people who surrender\.

ATHENS

As in many other countries, people have started organising to respond to the lack of policies to protect the most vulnerable groups from the combined effects of Covid\-19 and lockdown measures\.

[Steps](https://www.facebook.com/stepsgr/) , [Khora Social Kitchen](https://www.facebook.com/KhoraAthens/) , [Mano Aperta](https://www.facebook.com/manoaperta1) and [Hope Cafe](https://www.facebook.com/soulfoodforrefugees/) have started working together — also with the support of [Pampiraki Support Initiative](https://www.facebook.com/groups/PAMPIRAIKI/) , [SOS Refugiados](https://www.facebook.com/sosrefugiados/) and [Help Refugees](https://www.facebook.com/HelpRefugeesUK/) — and have created [Many Stops](https://www.facebook.com/stepsgr/posts/1307598109434766) , a food distribution action to be able to reach the homeless people of Athens\. Everyday they cook and distribute around 200 portions of food and distribute them around town between 5pm and 7pm\.

Also, Khora Social Kitchen is open for take\-away meals, Monday to Friday, from 12\.30 to 16\.00 in Kastalias 13, Kipseli\.

#### Frontex Executive Director reminds his staff of their priorities

In an internal staff email sent last week and seen by EUobserver, Frontex’s Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri said they had a legal obligation to support Greece\. This means that, despite the coronavirus outbreak, there will be “no reduction of deployment needs” for three of its missions along the Greek land and sea borders with Turkey, he said\. The missions include the so\-called rapid border interventions where Frontex sent in an extra 100 officers to the land border, along with helicopters, boats and other surveillance equipment earlier this month\.

#### **COVID\-19 cases update**

On Saturday it was [reported](https://www.facebook.com/info.point.covid19/posts/106696504315264) that nine people had tested positive for COVID\-19 in Tuzla Canton and a new order has been made not to move around in public places without protective equipment \(face masks and gloves\) \.
#### **Situation in camps getting worse under lockdown**

> Camp Blazuj, Anno Domini 2020 \(28\. March 2020\. \) 





> While they convince us that roses bloom in the camps, we get pictures of horror\. We have information to beat people and everyone complain about getting very little food\. Some of the people told us they took their phones away, so we are aware that we might be getting the last pictures from the camp so the truth wouldn’t come out\. Our moral duty is to share this because we are their only voice, and if they cut off our contacts, we can only guess that the situation is getting worse\. We are their only voice, we must not be silent\. 





> Around 3000 people are expected to “fit” in this camp\.

> But we all buy food from the supermarket, don’t we?
 

>  We all go to shopping\. 
 

>  Why aren’t they allowed to have anything?
 

>  I remind you that they are locked in there like animals\.
 

>  He dropped the phone and left without wanting to talk to me anymore\.

>  Do we realise how serious all this is?

> We are a group of hundreds of refugee doctors who are living in the UK\. Currently, we are in the middle of process of getting registration to practice medicine\. Also, our final licencing exam\(PLAB 2\) has been cancelled until July and could be cancelled again\. 





> In light of the current pandemic of the covid\-19, we need your support to put much more pressure on General Medical Council\(GMC\)and parliament to make decision regarding registration of refugee doctors who live in the UK\. 





> We are qualified doctors coming from crisis areas, so we faced such challenges\. Also, we have the drive, courage, knowledge, experience and language to deal with such crisis\. We need to pay back something and risk ourselves to the UK which support us\. We are ready immediately and more than happy to help NHS and patients\.
