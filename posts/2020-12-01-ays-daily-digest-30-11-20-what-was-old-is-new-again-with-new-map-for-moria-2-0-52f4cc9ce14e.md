### FEATURE: New map of camp/RIC for Lesvos

The Ministry of Immigration and Asylum confirmed on Sunday a map of the new Closed Controlled Structure of Islands in Vastria, north\-eastern Lesvos within the boundaries of the Municipality of Mytilene\. The building is supposed to start around Easter and end in the fall of 2021\. The camp will be accessible from a road that apparently goes to a landfill‚Ä¶but the camp will have ‚Äúno contact‚Äù with the landfill\. As Stonsi Gr reports:


> ‚ÄúIt should be noted here that the position was proposed by the Mayor of Mytilene, Strati Kyteli, and the Lesvos MP of New Democracy and 2nd Deputy Speaker of Parliament, Charalambos Athanassiou\. The position proposed to create the new structure is noted to belong to the administrative boundaries of the Municipality of Mytilene and specifically of the Community of Nea Kydonia\. During their visit to the island, the Minister of Immigration and Asylum Notis Mitarakis and the head of the European Action Group for Lesvos, Deputy Director General of the European Union for Immigration DG HOME Beate Gmter, **came to the position** \. A group of special advisers was with them\.‚Äù 





Only two and a half months after Moria burned down, this is what is coming\. AYS will continue to report on these developments\.

ABR on landings: ‚Äú _A boat carrying approximately 27 people landed south of Agrielia Kratigou, Lesvos south 22\.00 \(Sunday\) night\. They are scattered in small groups in the area, hiding in the woods because they are afraid that the Greek coast guard will illegally return them to Turkey\. Aegean Boat Report have obtained pictures, videos and location data, so that we can positively confirm that they are in fact on Lesvos\. Port police has been informed of their whereabouts, and that we have documented their arrival on Lesvos, to try to discourage them from violating their right to seek asylum and trying to return them to Turkey_ \.‚Äù [Alarm Phone](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1333441172174491650]) said they received a call from nine people this night as well\.

### The Arguinegu√≠n camp has been emptied

Publico is reporting that after three months and nine days, the ‚Äúuntenable‚Äù situation was dismantled as of 22:15 on Sunday\. ‚Äú _However, some tents will remain on the dock that will be used as a place of first assistance and health screening for those who disembark from the rescue ships from now on_ \.‚Äù The president of the Canary Islands, √Ångel V√≠ctor Torres, who asked several times for the camp to be closed said:


> ‚ÄúI am celebrating it, but there is still much to do\. \(The camp\) was set up urgently in August to attend to the migrants who arrived and were rescued\.‚Äù He said that reaching 2,600 people has been ‚Äúunsustainable\.‚Äù He reminded Canarian citizens that ‚Äúnobody likes to leave their family behind‚Ä¶those Canaries, our ancestors, who were forced to leave everything and look for other shores, we carry it in our DNA\.

According to a European Parliament press release: ‚Äú _MEPs are set to demand answers from the European Border and Coast Guard Agency‚Äôs Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri regarding the incidents revealed by media in which Greek coastguards ‚Äî with the alleged knowledge and even involvement of Frontex operatives ‚Äî stopped migrants trying to reach EU shores and sent them back to Turkish waters\.

As journalist [Giorgos Christides](https://twitter.com/g_christides/status/1333503968903909376) reported, both the German and Romanian interior ministries have denied involvement with incidents involving Frontex\. Romania denies that their Frontex vessel helped block and push back a dinghy on June 8th\. Germany denies that the German federal police were involved with Frontex pushbacks off Samos on August 10th\.

### Judge: Migrants who steer boats across channel are not a part of a trafficking gang

Yet [the Home Office](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/english-channel-crossings-migrants-jailed-smugglers-patel-b1762927.html) is twisting these remarks so they can continue branding migrants as traffickers\. [Lizzie Dearden](https://twitter.com/lizziedearden/status/1333429734043250688) from the Independent further reports:


> ‚ÄúEight migrants have been jailed this year for piloting dinghies from France and more cases are going through the courts\. The Home Office‚Äôs immigration enforcement criminal investigations unit using drone footage to identify migrants steering, then referring them to be prosecuted\. 





> In October, the CPS issued new guidance to lawyers after some questioned if such charges were in the public interest\. A document said the offence of assisting unlawful immigration could be applied to asylum seekers who steer boats because they have ‚Äúfacilitated‚Äù a journey\. 





> In a case later that month, Judge Rupert Lowe found that those who pilot boats do not organise crossings, may be coerced and threatened, and are ultimately ‚Äúone of the trafficked\.‚Äù He said steering boats was not ‚Äúremotely equivalent‚Äù to smuggling migrants in a lorry for payment\. 





> The Home Office left out that excerpt in a press release branding the Iraqi man being sentenced a ‚Äúpeople smuggler\.‚Äù In response to a later request for comment, it used a small excerpt of Judge Lowe‚Äôs remarks to support the claim that its approach had been ‚Äúupheld by the courts\.‚Äù 





> Detention Action director Bella Sankey called it a ‚Äútruth\-twisting smear against someone unable to defend themselves\.‚Äù The Home Office denied the accusation, saying several judges had passed ‚Äúsignificant sentences‚Äù‚Äù 




### Auberge des Migrants on France and the UK‚Äôs agreement on tougher patrols:


> ‚ÄúFranco\-British agreements, agreements of shame\. Great Britain will donate ‚Ç¨ 31\.5m to the French government ‚Äúto prevent migrants‚Äô crossings of the Channel\.‚Äù That‚Äôs a lot of money\. It could have been used to welcome exiles to France: it is recalled that the vast majority of exiles stranded at the border are persons rejected by the French or European asylum system\. Great Britain is not a dream, but a last chance for them\. The worst part is that this money won‚Äôt prevent crossings: no more drones, barbed wire, radars, police, it will just lead the exiles to take more risks, and pay even more for smugglers\. No boundaries are impassable\. ‚ÄúAuthorities‚Äù know this, but they want to give pledges to those who fear a ‚Äúmigratory invasion\.‚Äù And here is France in the same situation as Turkey: being paid to block people on its territory\. And paid cheap: Erdogan had managed to get ‚Ç¨ 5 billion\! We are asking for legal ways of access to Britain, and the exit of the Touquet agreements, which Macron promised in case of Brexit\!‚Äù
