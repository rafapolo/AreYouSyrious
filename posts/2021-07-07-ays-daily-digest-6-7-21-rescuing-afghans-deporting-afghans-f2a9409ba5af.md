### Uzbekistan/Afghanistan

Following the increase of border crossings by people fleeing Afghanistan, authorities have opened a tent city near Termez\. It should get at least 80 tents, according to [Eurosianet](https://eurasianet.org/uzbekistan-bracing-for-possible-afghan-refugee-crisis?fbclid=IwAR35swPbLKrQYfJujBllA02Jray-bTcJpRBqUBlg7g5NSBcBhd4kr2Ka7cU) \.

The Afghan Ministry of Refugees has asked European countries to urgently stop deportations due to the worsening security situation and the Taliban controlling some 150 districts, BBC revealed\. However, Germany is continueing deporations; Pro Asyl [demands](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/33424/pro-asyl-demands-three-month-pause-in-deportations-from-germany-to-afghanistan?fbclid=IwAR0mrf11D1p1PG4O8Qo8kA9lrL4jPJxQQHgih0TYdYr0K6PLQ3UeDut9B4k) to halt them for three months, according to InfoMigrants\. At the sime time, the first Bundeswehr helpers [arrived](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/33417/afghan-bundeswehr-helpers-arrive-in-germany-for-asylum-report?fbclid=IwAR32eSicsfuLdfuVa6PsMtM7yBQ0xR0MRHCeV87jcFjXghLpMN_sqVVznEM) to get their asylum\.

### Syria

In the first half of 2021, the Syrian Network for Human Rights [documented](https://sn4hr.org/blog/2021/07/05/56481/) 53 attacks on vital civilian facilities, including five medical facilities\. 723 civilians died, more than 900 people were arrested arbitrary\. ‚ÄúJune saw an increase unprecedented in the past several months in the pace of military operations in northwest Syria, especially in ground bombardment by Syrian\-Russian alliance forces on the region‚Äù, the authors note\.

### Greece

Journalist Franziska Grillmeier [wrote](https://twitter.com/f_grillmeier/status/1412462025637249027) a Twitter thread highlighting the mental conditions of the residents of the new Moria camp\. ‚ÄúOnce they are actually arriving in a safe space, we see them collapse‚Äù, said a doctor onsite, referring to the survival mode people are there\.

This goes along with an [open letter](http://birdsofimmigrants.jogspace.net/2021/07/06/letters-to-the-world-from-ritsona-no-21/) by Parwana Amiri, who lives in Ritsona camp\. ‚ÄúThe sense of confinement is becoming oppressive\. Our eyes are prevented from seeing the outside world‚Äù, she writes and later continues:


> I suffer from this imprisonment\. Immensely\. And I struggle to go to school, to learn, to grow, always afraid of what others will think of me, of my life‚Ä¶\.

After six rescue operations, the Ocean Viking is [requesting](https://www.humanrightsatsea.org/2021/07/06/ocean-viking-572-survivors-need-to-disembark-in-a-place-of-safety-without-further-delay/?fbclid=IwAR28BQRAlTvOElxWlH2Bv4T7WXyH9t3XdK49viuRd_YNkvzLTPcsCPDwRGk) a safe harbor for some 570 people\.

Between Wednesday and Sunday, four beats sunk off Tunisia, now 49 bodies were found\. 84 people were rescued and brought on shore, according to [InfoMigrants](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/33414/dozens-of-corpses-found-off-tunisia-after-several-shipwrecks?fbclid=IwAR3Qu2Ily1qn2n8l97j4AK99b-Ehe3R3T1MH-IDwEwL-pvRCLRdraihoXjQ) \.

In another incident, some 100 people who were stuck off Libya, are [feared](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1412479146274525184) to have been pulled back\.
### Italy

Matteo Villa from the Europe and Global Governance Centre published a Twitter thread on the perception and reality of people crossing the Mediterranean to Italy\. The fact check can be also found on [ISPI online](https://www.ispionline.it/it/pubblicazione/ispitel-fact-checking-migrazioni-2021-31027?fbclid=IwAR3pPGW1cucVGiiPG7INmjD8xgjCJ0Db3jY1oekJKOGwZw_Akil389B-pcs) \.

Oxfam demand the Italian government to stop funding the so\-called Libyan Coast Guard and change its approach of migration management\. According to Oxfam, Italy has paid some 32,6 million Euros since 2017 and allocated another 500,000 for this year, InfoMigrants [writes](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/33412/oxfam-says-italy-must-stop-financing-libyan-coast-guards?fbclid=IwAR1J1npU0PoRkv_ynrqjgOtQZPjFaoMC5HNEDqnfUjzchZkg6TsODKptfAI) \.
### Lithuania

Following the crossing of some 600 Belarussian residents to Lithuania and the state of emergency there, European Council President Charles Michel condemned the alleged instrumentalization of migration and ensured support through Frontex, InfoMigrants [writes](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/33425/frontex-bolsters-lithuania-belarus-border-as-irregular-crossings-spike?fbclid=IwAR2hd0zC6he5QSkKLfkejntC0jOk2qeMrSZujSRRr6golCdEJ_q1-QGrY88) \. Meanwhile, the Belarussian president threatened to ‚Äúnot stop anyone‚Äù trying to cross the border; including people on the run from Afghanistan or Syria\. However, he did not explain how he wants to get them on European soil\. Lithuania is preparing itself by building a tent village for up to 1000 people, Reuters [adds](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-condemns-belarus-pressuring-lithuania-with-migrants-michel-2021-07-05/?fbclid=IwAR0So8gYWq5kmBV2h48kHrLA1niyWiv83NTEuwYpXtI19i5Tcb1UcXyjF8Q) \.
### Austria

After the court ruling, that the deportation of a man to Slovenia without the possibility to ask for asylum was illegal, Amnesty International criticized the mindset of the police\. Also the Interior Minister was blamed for not having reacted so far, Salzburger Nachrichten [writes](https://www.sn.at/politik/innenpolitik/amnesty-kritik-an-nehammer-nach-pushback-urteil-106219483?fbclid=IwAR2bXaxD1Z94CYhKrOLCsrI3N9KzIwr5Eg1g20CLuVld3YWSe8AOcXEH4eo) \.

### UK

The Home Office wants to block visas for visitors from countries, which are not cooperating in deportations\. The [bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3023?fbclid=IwAR0OM3XOsJ3g66FDqRNFJI1cEBnhXsCPIbrsMJ2xqZqe3ZElmAemIwnlKKk) , which is now in the second hearing in the House of Commons, ‚Äúwill only worsen the problems with the United Kingdom‚Äôs current asylum system‚Äù, [says](https://www.freemovement.org.uk/the-nationality-and-borders-bill-2021-first-impressions/) Free Movement\.


The New York Times [explains](https://www-nytimes-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.nytimes.com/2021/07/06/world/europe/uk-migration-priti-patel.amp.html?fbclid=IwAR0iZ39ChFA1psJrZRyHcf7RkiAxANw1Ga_psgnvEJ16OmrYWF2WLzuZQ5I) , entering the country illegally, would make it easier ‚Äúto remove someone to a safe country while their asylum claim is processed,‚Äù [the Home Office said](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/landmark-borders-bill-to-enter-parliament) \.
