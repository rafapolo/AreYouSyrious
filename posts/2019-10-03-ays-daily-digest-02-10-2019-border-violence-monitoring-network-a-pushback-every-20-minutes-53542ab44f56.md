### AYS DAILY DIGEST 02/10/2019: Border Violence Monitoring Network: A Pushback every 20 Minutes

In a heartrending new report by Border Violence Monitoring Network, not only are more details released on the plight of those attempting to reach safety, a staggering new figure was released\.


> In fact, this month, Croatia proudly announced it had ‚Äúarrested and processed‚Äù 11,813 people who had attempted illegal entry into its territory, a number rising to 18,260 if you include the 6,447 who were returned from Slovenia to Croatia\. These figures, which only cover the first eight months of the year, represent a startling reality\. They point towards the scale of the pushback apparatus which, if these numbers can be taken seriously, mean a person is pushed back from Croatia _every 20 minutes_ \. 





> Perhaps it is even a conservative estimate to mark pushbacks at this frequency\. By what can we measure the Croatian Ministry of Interior‚Äôs statements that these were indeed legally ‚Äúprocessed‚Äù cases? The overwhelming majority of incidents recorded by the Border Violence Monitoring Network show little resemblance to procedural norms\. Pushbacks themselves represent an unlawful and violent deviation from legislated standards\. Many cases recorded reveal that the police did not even take the identity of the transit groups they were collectively expelling\. More often than not, the police effort is directed towards the violent traumatisation of people, the burning of their possessions and cruel beatings, rather than adherence to the rule of law\. This begs the question: how many more ‚Äúunprocessed‚Äù cases can be added to this 18,260? 





As we have documented from the beginning, the Croatian government has progressed steadfastly from systematically denying pushbacks now to bragging about their efficiency, however not in so many words\. They are proud to ‚Äúdefend the border‚Äù and to ‚Äúprocess‚Äù people, but it is widely known that if they were to boast about the implications of this \(that the Croatian government is eagerly engaging in illegal readmission\), it would be a different story\.

Upon reading the report, an acquaintance of the author asked ‚Äúso what is gonna happen?‚Äù and this remains a very important question for us to remember\. Even though we are strongly overwhelmed by the current situation, we must spare time to anticipate what is coming next and try to prepare accordingly\.

### Eastern Mediterranean

In Greece and on the Aegean, the numbers do not stop climbing, as a total of nine boats arrived, carrying 392 people, according to Aegean Boat Report\. Six arrived on Lesvos, two to Chios, and one to Leros\. For more info, go [here](https://www.facebook.com/AegeanBoatReport/photos/a.285312485325196/662048974318210/?type=3&theater) \.

Furthermore, ABR has a great interactive data\-set for you to filter the arrivals, transfers, interceptions in order to gather a complete picture of what has been happening in the last several years\. Go [here](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/1CiKR1_R7-1UbMHKhzZe_Ji_cvqF7xlfH/page/oOyx) for the data set\.

In light of the sharp increase in movement across the Aegean in recent months, the Greek Government has predictably decided to step up its naval presence\. Although the potential for this action to increase some kind of ‚Äúrescue‚Äù presence, with the news of ‚Äúat least 125 new Coast Guard officers and thirty members of the Special Forces ‚Ä¶\[as well as a plan\] to open up the bidding process for the purchase of a state\-of\-the\-art maritime border surveillance system‚Äù the wellbeing of people does not seem to be at the forefront\.

Moreover the fact that the presence of these agents end up precipitating shipwrecks as panicked smugglers leave people to fend for themselves\. Read about the decision [here](https://greece.greekreporter.com/2019/10/02/greece-boosts-naval-presence-in-the-aegean-to-stem-migrant-flow/) \.

Furthermore according to [Daphne Tolis](https://www.facebook.com/daphne.tolis/posts/10156777122662371) , the Greek government plans to move around 550 people from Lesvos to Thessaloniki on Sunday\. Although it is good to evacuate the islands, this is too little, too late\.

Mobile Info Team for Refugees in Greece reports that the Urdu Skype phone number has changed

‚ÄúPeople who want to apply for asylum are supposed to ask the Greek Asylum Service for an appointment through Skype\. Unfortunately it is very, very difficult for Urdu speakers to get through on Skype\. One of the obstacles to reaching the Asylum Service has now finally been removed\. The official Skype account for Urdu speakers is now much easier to find, which will hopefully keep Urdu speakers from calling the wrong account‚Äù

### CENTRAL MEDITERRANEAN AND NORTH AFRICA

A nailbiting afternoon and evening for Watch the Med Alarmphone as they were contacted by a ship in severe distress around 2:30 p\.m\., and again a few hours later\. Although Alarmphone followed protocol and contacted the Maltesee authorities, there was no confirmation from the government whether SAR was on the way\.

Fortunately, the boat, despite engine troubles, ended up making it into the range of the Italian Coast Guard where the people were rescued and taken to Lampedusa\.

NORTHERN EUROPE

In Amsterdam, Netherlands, now 37 people from Eritrea, ages 16‚Äì25, will be on the street\. Artikel 8 EVRM had been working with the government in order to ensure that the people would have safe and secure housing, however conditions have deteriorated\. All 37 of them were Dublin cases where they had their fingerprints in another EU country and therefore were at risk of deportation\. Here is a summary:


> ‚ÄúTomorrow 37 young refugees \(aged 16 to 25\) will be back on the street in Amsterdam\. 





> The young boys, who have a ‚ÄòDublin Claim‚Äô, were hosted by our friends from [Artikel 8 EVRM](https://www.facebook.com/artikel8evrm/?__tn__=%2CdKH-R-R&eid=ARAn1Z2JLpaJ8H8iUPF9AYPiSjQv1cbIpcs70dJwIYm1oZCofCuwsrjjPDfXSsHGZUxnVVN2BHuq5AS1&fref=mentions&hc_location=group) until now\. They are not eligible for help unlike other homeless people in the city, and are all on the endless waiting list for emergency shelter by the municipality\. It is highly unlikely that the boys will have a safe place to sleep any time soon, and the regular winter shelter will not open before the end of November\. 
 

>  This group will now be forced to join the [Vluchtmaat](https://www.facebook.com/vluchtmaat/?__tn__=%2CdKH-R-R&eid=ARDwtsUpUwQ7icPXfCSNv1uw-nIxJUutYTsoaHCw7ygeWPlQCp2LRz-ahxrJTNUqN2KHkgIFv-sx-nJ_&fref=mentions&hc_location=group) \(38 people, including women\), who are also sleeping on the streets since yesterday\.

> We will keep supporting them as best as we can, but we need your help\. If you are around Amsterdam and can give a hand then please send us a message\.‚Äù

Small steps and small victories in **Scotland, UK** where a Sheriff Court has paused the evictions of asylum seekers\.

‚ÄúAround 130 court actions concerning proposed lock\-changes by Serco have been put on hold or continued by Glasgow Sheriff Court meaning clients in all those cases have been protected\.

Another handful of cases was dismissed, as asylum support had been reinstated for those clients\.

Lawyers representing people affected by the policy are seeking interim interdicts from the Sheriff Court on a case\-by\-case basis as a means of protecting people at risk of summary eviction, while the law is being clarified\.‚Äù
