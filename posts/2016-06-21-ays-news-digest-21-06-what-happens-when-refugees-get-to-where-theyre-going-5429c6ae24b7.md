> _“Families of 21, with 15 children, try to live on food assistance from neighbors, living in single\-room houses with no bathroom or electricity\. Babies die of cold, while young girls face sexual abuse in the name of so\-called ‘marriages’ in exchange for house rent, or they are forced to become ‘second ’ or ‘third’ wives\. All these things are being overlooked by the state,” the report said\._ 





> _Violence and xenophobia against refugees is also rising in Turkey, it added, also calculating that around half of the refugees in Turkey are under the age of 18\._

> _The CHP’s inspectors also witnessed children as young as 5 working at textile manufacturers, a sector where child labor is widely abused\._

#### Mediterranean
### Sea Watch is expanding its actions with Sea Watch Air


> _The catastrophic conditions for refugees call for a more efficient rescue efforts and the use of air surveillance\. It will allow us a broader scan of the operational area as well as more structured operations within the network of aid organizations on site\._ 





> _Sea Watch will use an airplane for aerial reconnaissance and collaborate with Humanitarian Pilots Initiative\. The airplane will head to Tunisia tomorrow\. They will need a few weeks there for pilot training and test flights\._

#### Germany
### Difficult life of refugee children in Germany


> _According to the report, refugee children not only have far lower standards of safety, medical treatment and education than their German\-born counterparts, but are also treated very differently depending on their prospects for being allowed to stay in Germany\._ 





> _“Refugee children have often survived horrors and brutal violence\. For this reason they need special protection and care,” said German UNICEF chief Christian Schneider\._ 





> _The report accused the German government of negligence in the face of Europe’s unprecedented refugee crisis\. The organization had already pointed out in 2014, UNICEF said, that the rights of migrant children were not being respected, and the recent influx of refugees has served to make the situation much worse\._ 





> _Not only do refugee youth lack access to the education afforded to German children, the amount of time they have to stay with their families in unsafe and unsanitary first arrival centers has doubled from the minimum three months to half a year\._ 





> _This creates a problem for [children’s integration](http://www.dw.com/en/german-government-to-release-800-million-euros-to-boost-integration-and-social-welfare/a-19331160) when they eventually start school in Germany\._ 





> _UNICEF also took issue with that it called “special facilities” set aside for families with a low chance of remaining in Germany\. The children in these facilities may not go to school nor do they receive any other sort of educational opportunity\._ 





> _The organization called on Berlin to implement refugee children’s rights to be in a safe, a hygienic environment with access to learning and the psychological assistance necessary to many young people who have experienced trauma in their country of origin\._ 




#### UK
### Kindertransport veterans shame Calais


> _Surviving members of the “Kindertransport” that brought 10,000 refugees to the UK on the eve of World War Two have visited the infamous Calais Jungle to meet lone children seeking asylum in the UK\._ 





> _“If seeing is believing, I couldn’t believe the condition of the camp,” says Rabbi Harry Jacobi, 90, as he meets some of the 400 children who call the Jungle home\._ 





> _“This is not a concentration camp… yet I feel so furious\. I am ashamed with the whole of Europe not doing enough for the refugees here\. This camp should be closed tomorrow\.”_ 





> _Earlier this week, the 90\-year\-old rabbi and peer Alf Dubs — two men who were once refugees themselves — travelled to the camp to meet a new generation in peril\._ 





> _They told the boys about their personal refugee journeys\. In turn, the boys tell them what they think will be good about life in Britain — school and playing cricket, like they did at home\._ 





> _The youngsters ask how long they have to wait to get to Britain\._ 





> _“We’re going to do our best, we’re pushing hard to make the government do it quickly,” says Lord Dubs\._ 





> _“It’s a great country\. I hope you get there soon\.”_
