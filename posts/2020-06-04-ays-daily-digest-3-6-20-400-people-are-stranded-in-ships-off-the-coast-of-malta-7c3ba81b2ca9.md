### FEATURE Over 400 people are stranded off the coast of Malta on cruise ships

Well it might sound luxurious, the reality is far from that\. [Malta Today](https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/comment/blogs/102694/illegal_floating_prisons__carla_camilleri?fbclid=IwAR2TuuRlN7VhHXecY6nGDd9HsPXkk4nF6tQ8g-pk-5xaZ8w8d5lzQWG-UoI#.XtgjhDpKg2w) emphasizes how this is breaking international law:


> “They have no contact with the outside world, no contact with the authorities and no contact with monitoring bodies or lawyers\. They cannot leave the place where they are being held, and in most probability, they have little or no contact with family members\. 





> This form of incommunicado detention, compounded by the lack of access to information, for an indefinite period of time constitutes the most serious violation of the norm protecting the right to liberty of human beings\.”

> “Instead of disembarking them in a safe place as international law requires, those rescued at sea are being used for political negotiations with EU member states\.”

#### LIBYA

In a joint statement, **CHDRA and 41 Libyan organizations condemn the massacre of 30 migrants in Mizdah** :

First for context:


> “26 migrants from Bangladesh and four African nationalities lost their lives on Wednesday, 27 May 2020, and 11 other migrants were injured, some of whom were transferred to Tripoli for treatment, according to statement from the Ministry of Interior in the National Accord Government\. 





> The perpetrators surrounded the detention site for migrants, run by smugglers from the town of Mizdah, and fired intensively at the place where approximately 200 migrants of different nationalities were held according to reliable sources in Mazda…The sources added “The attack came after the killing of a well\-known human trafficker called ‘Youssef Mohamed’ by a group of migrants detained at the place\.’” 





The signers’ demands:


> “The signing organizations in this statement stress the necessity of following up and closing these ‘migrants warehouses’ that sell, smuggle and traffic migrants openly in many Libyan cities\. It is unacceptable for these crimes to be carried on by these criminal gangs of smuggling and trafficking who have taken advantage of the ongoing situation within the country, from armed conflicts, political and institutional division, which have killed hundreds of Libyans, not to mention the vulnerable migrants and asylum seekers\. 





> \(We demand that\) 1\) The Public Prosecutor’s Office to open a fast and transparent investigation into the mass killing of migrants in Mizdah, identifying those responsible for the crime, pursuing and punishing the perpetrators\. 2\) The local authorities to disclose the fate and whereabouts of the remaining migrants, asylum seekers and workers who escaped the massacre at the assaulted smuggling warehouse\.”

### **New Greek laws put pressure on grassroots NGOs and make starting new NGOs nearly impossible**

They are arguing for more transparency, however NGOs argue some will be impossible to implement\. There are more costs for registration, you need to show financial statements dating back to two years, etc\. Greece has 86 registered NGOs working on migration \(73 are national and 13 are international\) and the smaller ones or the ones that were recently created seem to have the most to lose from this\.

Is this true? Data shows exactly the opposite trend... https://t.co/aCjEyDskRS

The only detail on “the migrant deal” discussed during the meeting between Maltese prime minister Robert Abela and Libyan prime minister Fayez al\-Sarraj in Tripoli on 28 May, is that it might include two coordination offices, one in Malta one in Libya\.

As war goes on in Libya and COVID\-19 is escalating in a country without many means of prevention, a deal to possibly send back people who reached Malta to Libya would be completely inhumane\.

Asylum Protection in Serbia tweeted about a pushback that happened on 26 May 2020:


> “A group of five people from Algeria and Syria, captured after crossing to Hungary, where they are surrounded by soldiers with weapons\. According to them, the soldiers shot at them and shot at the ground near their feet\. No one was injured, and after that they were pushed back to Serbia\.” 




#### GERMANY

Berlin is building dozens of new refugee homes, when COVID\-19 is putting further demand on housing\. InfoMigrants reports _“A total of 38 new accommodations, made of prefabricated concrete blocks and guaranteed to last 80 years, are to be built over the next few years\. Eight of these, with a total capacity of around 2,000, are expected to be completed by next summer\.”_ Some homes are also for expected new arrivals\. More [here](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/25130/berlin-builds-dozens-of-new-refugee-homes-despite-falling-numbers?fbclid=IwAR0cqeMTGbVwITNof85f0Vq-u6EAYnGXQV75A8z0C2d3Rhw4S1idYhjkbco) \.
#### EU

Danish Refugee Council’s thoughts on the EU’s upcoming Pact on Migration and Asylum and choosing another direction:

**_“The threat is NOT_** _the men, women and children fleeing persecution, conflict and violence who seek safety and protection at our borders\. **The threat is** the steady legitimization and justification of an undermining of rights for refugees and migrants, and for those who support and assist them\. **The threat is** the erosion of the global refugee system\. The gradual normalization of the extreme, witnessed over the past five years in the EU’s migration and asylum policies within its borders and in its external actions\._

_The DRC appeals to the EU leadership to use the pending new Pact to bring rights back to the center of its asylum and migration policies and to use the regained unity in the EU to find joint solutions to improve asylum systems and migration responses\. **DRC recommends for the EU legislators to agree on a new pact on migration and asylum that** :_
1. _Focuses on compliance with EU asylum, and limits reform of the asylum acquis to the Dublin system, including a permanent solidarity mechanism\._
2. _Ensures effective access to the asylum procedure for all who seek protection\._
3. _Supports integration of refugees with a view to long\-term solutions\._
4. _Supports responsibility\-sharing for providing protection — in the EU and beyond\._
5. _Promotes rights\-based and conflict\-sensitive migration cooperation and responses\.”_
