#### **FEATURE**

Among all European countries, Greece ranked last in [the World Press Index issued by Journalists without Borders](https://rsf.org/en/index) \. Press freedom has faced a setback with journalists covering controversial issues for the country — the frequent pushbacks and refugee issues but also Covid\-19 — facing challenges and self\-censorship due to lack of funds to continue their work\.

Phones being tapped without explanation and monitored through spyware by the Greek authorities, but also the adoption by the Greek parliament of a legal provision to combat COVID\-19 disinformation making it a [criminal offence to spread fake news, punishable by up to five years](https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/11/17/greece-alleged-fake-news-made-crime) imprisonment — these have been some of the current government’s tactics creating a chilling effect on free speech and media freedom\.

With regard to asylum policies, we have repeatedly reported the institutionalized pushbacks by the Greek government which continue to take place in Greek waters\. There have been more than 50 complaints of deportations in Evros and the Aegean, as revealed by the head of the independent authority Andreas Pottakis, who presented the Ombudsman’s annual report for 2021\.

Only two days ago, a hostel for unaccompanied minors in Thessaloniki, the second\-largest city in Greece, was attacked by a group of fascists who attacked eight unaccompanied minors, hitting a 16\-year\-old boy from Pakistan on the head with a stick, punching him in the face and stealing his mobile phone\.

At the same time, victims of shipwrecks in Greek waters have often been imprisoned, facing lifelong sentences in jail for smuggling while spending sometimes even a year in pre\-trial detention\.

Criticized by NGOs, international media and opposition politicians, the inhumane and flawed asylum system forces people on the move to live on the fringes of society, in limbo, without the right to access the labour market, social services, cash assistance, healthcare systems or accommodation\. The legal info team, Mobile info team, is raising awareness by showcasing the experiences of people seeking asylum on mainland Greece, Crete and Rhodes since the policy changes in late November 2021\. Read the report [here](https://www.mobileinfoteam.org/blockedfromthesystem?fbclid=IwAR2lH8tWnEFtzbfjfiV8T-SZ6piIi8Y5QkttFemqWY86vyWNiFNcnGXAW9o) \.

### **Documenting physical evidence of violence and torture** **of people fleeing Libya**

Medic Mohamed Fadlalla, aboard the GeoBarents rescue ship, documents the physical evidence of violence and torture that people on the move have faced in Libyan jails to make sure that such cases do not fall through the cracks and go unnoticed by the EU authorities, according to a tweet by journalist Franziska Grillmeier on Twitter\.

Those being held in Libya are often tortured by their captors demanding money\.

“As neither he nor his family could pay \(as many survivors often tell me\) they proceeded to beat him\. They then tied his arms up, lit a lighter, and sprayed cologne from a bottle through the flame into his chest and arm\. This created a large area of burns on the boy’s body\.”

### **Geo Barents’ disembarkation on hold in Sicily without explanation**

470 rescued people had been waiting at sea for a week when the disembarkation of the humanitarian ship Geo Barents was put on hold once again on May 19 without explanation according to [InfoMigrants](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/40661/mediterranean-infant-torture-victims-among-migrants-on-dangerous-crossing?fbclid=IwAR0Ta3YCehjuQMVyf5ZBDje5sgy1GPoN9OmNFdHilKyGERNMlOprZPu919k) \.

The ship still had 238 people waiting on board, and six people jumped into the sea “out of desperation after 11 days of unjustified waiting,”

**Italy**

**Afghan woman dies from a heart attack in a tent camp**

After reaching the port of Rocella Ionica, a 70\-year\-old woman from Afghanistan died of a heart attack on Wednesday, May 18, reports [InfoMigrants](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/40638/italy-afghan-migrant-woman-suffers-fatal-heart-attack-in-tent-camp?fbclid=IwAR3D9ZsNYCkfM3GeUHxpxbFb5cKZV7RgCZF1uj9sCBcz_qn07RealudfrTE) news media\. She had reached the Calabrian seaport together with 96 others, including many children\.

A medical team in Rocella had checked her upon arrival, but her condition was considered as not serious enough to require hospitalization\. Her condition deteriorated suddenly and she died despite the immediate intervention of health workers and Red Cross volunteers\. The woman was discovered to be diabetic after her death\.

While police are investigating the death, prosecutors in the nearby city of Locri are expected to order an autopsy\.
### **Asylum seekers eligible to open an Italian bank account**

Asylum seekers who are waiting for a residence permit have the right to open a basic bank account in Italy\.

The Italian government website Integrazione Migranti \(Integration Migrants\) has published information about opening a ‘basic bank account’ in Italy\. The ‘FAQ’ site highlights that asylum seekers have the right to open a bank account, and explains which documents are needed\.

### **Illegal detentions and deportations in Grand Canaria**

Serious institutional human rights violations are taking place at the CATE detention centre of Gran Canaria and Lanzarote, warns the Spanish Center for the Defense of Human Rights, IRIDIA\.

According to IRIDIA, people are being detained under inadequate conditions for more than 72 hours without being provided with a lawyer\. Despite the organization’s request to visit CATE, the Spanish Ministry of Interior has not allowed visiting\.

IRIDIA has repeatedly denounced the irregular deportations of people with expired orders and the way CATEs function as extensions of police stations with no regulations\.


■■■■■■■■■■■■■■

At the same time, on the northern coast of Africa, in Ceuta, cross\-border workers will be able to obtain a working visa from May 24\.

The Delegation Government of the autonomous Spanish city, in coordination with the Ministries of the Interior and Foreign Affairs and the Consulate of Spain in Tetouan, will allow cross\-border people to access Ceuta through a visa with limited territorial validity and without a permit an Identity Card of Foreigners \(TIE\) needed\.

ONLY THE FOLLOWING MAY SUBMIT A REQUEST:
- Workers who have been granted valid cross\-border work authorization\.
- Workers who have the previous authorization but “pending registration with Social Security”\.


All of them must be included in the list provided to this Consulate General by the Immigration Office of the Ceuta Government Delegation\.

#### **CZECH REPUBLIC**
### **Ukrainians seeking refuge in the Czech Republic to take up jobs, otherwise lose welfare benefits**

Of the 348,000 Ukrainians seeking refuge in the Czech Republic, only around 50,000 of them have found jobs in industries that were previously short of workers\. According to [InfoMigrants](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/40657/czech-authorities-encourage-ukrainian-refugees-to-seek-work--or-else-lose-benefits?fbclid=IwAR24tPFJGq2nyPhRtIgiaY2GkRWCsvvEjKzloSRzWi5Lx9F0BO9pGkGjOt8) , more than a third of them have either returned home or moved to other countries within the EU and beyond\.

In the meanwhile, those who have stayed and are being hosted in government\-provided shelters are likely to lose their entitlement to the state’s assistance after the Czech government makes changes in the health care system tying benefits to employment status\. In this way, people are forced to seek employment as adults and are provided free health care only for the first 180 days\.
#### UK
### No legal routes for asylum seekers in the UK — Rwanda expects the first transfer in May

There has been much criticism of the controversial asylum agreement between the United Kingdom and Rwanda, but the east African country will receive the first 50 asylum seekers by the end of May despite critical remarks from the United Nations, rights activists, and opposition leaders\.

A controversial reform, passed by the British parliament last month to crack down on illegal immigration, introduces life sentences for people smugglers — the Nationality and Borders Act — which also imposes harsher jail terms for those arriving illegally, and raises fears of discriminating against asylum seekers and refugees\.

Despite this, and no safe and legal routes left to the UK, people are still attempting to reach the UK through sea crossings, risking their lives\. Just a few days ago, a total of 34 people were rescued by the RNLI rescue crew amid a severe storm\.

### **New podcast episode — The Civil Fleet**

On May 21, Kathrin Schmidt — a rescue worker who saved the lives of 14,000 refugees in the Mediterranean Sea aboard the Iuventa five years ago — and three others from the ship are due to appear in an Italian court on charges of facilitating illegal entry into the country\. They could all face 20 years behind bars\.

She explains what this case means for the future of activist\-led sea rescues, and for the people on the move at Europe’s edges\.
