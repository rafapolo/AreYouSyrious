#### FEATURED STORIES
### Night deportation from Hungary

Hungary‚Äôs infamous policies and failing to respect the common laws and principles of the European Union are already widely known\. However, lately ahead of the upcoming elections and in the generally heated discussion on all questions regarding migration and international protection, the country‚Äôs official actions are touching a new low\.

Several strands of electrified wiring in front of the multiple barbed wire fences still stand on the border with Serbia, where one of the recently expelled families was returned in an event that grabbed many people‚Äôs attention\. 
A family‚Äôs hopes were crushed after they had spent more than three months at Hungary‚Äôs border migrant camp, having waited for over two years for an answer to their request and later for their appeal to be considered\.


> _In the transit zone, not only is starvation a common practice, but the experiences of those who stayed there are horrid, described in more detail [here](https://dex.hu/x.php?id=index_kulfold_cikklink&url=https%3A%2F%2Findex.hu%2Fbelfold%2F2017%2F06%2F12%2Ftranzitzona_roszke_tompa_borton_menekultek_terhes_no_hatosagi_tulkapas_gyerekek%2F) \._ 





Hungary rejected the families‚Äô asylum requests and gave them the choice of being expelled to Serbia or being flown back to Afghanistan\. 
 ‚ÄúThe treatment of these families, including their removal from Hungarian territory with no serious effort to look at their claims to refugee status, is deeply regrettable,‚Äù U\.N\. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi reportedly said\. Still, obviously nobody did anything to prevent their expulsion and Hungary‚Äôs methods continue\. 
**A family of six was deported to Serbia, having to cross a gate in the border fence in the dark, with no one waiting for them on the Serbian side\.**

UNHCR workers witnessed the whole thing\.

‚ÄúHungary never examined their asylum claims on merit,‚Äù said Andras Lederer, of the Helsinki Committee\. It was **the Helsinki Committee** who took the three cases of Afghan families who were about to be expelled to the European Court of Human Rights\. **The ECHR suspended Hungary‚Äôs plan to deport a family\.** 
The activists said they had secured an interim measure to stop the deportation of one of two other families awaiting a similar fate\.


> According to Eurostat, there have been deportations to all major countries of origin, even Syria\. 





> **In 2018, Hungary deported 45 people to Iran, 80 to Afghanistan, 95 to Iraq and 25 to Syria\.** 



### Urgent action needed in Libya to prevent a disaster

As the death toll from the fighting in Tripoli rises to 443, last night‚Äôs airstrikes directly hit the Tajoura detention centre compound in Tripoli, a mere 80m from where refugee women are trapped, reports MSF\. However, the EU is still cooperating with the Libyan coast guard to send people who are seeking asylum in Europe back to war\-torn Libya\.

In the first four months of 2019, for every 8 #migrants who departed from #Libya-n shores, 1 died or went missing.

And the more Europe delegated search and rescue to the Libyan Coast Guard, the more the risk of death at sea has risen. https://t.co/W2WVWr6ECQ

‚ÄúUtilising civilian infrastructure in this manner constitutes a violation of international humanitarian law and must be avoided at all costs‚Äù, says the UN\. At the same time, at the UNHCR Gathering & Departure Facility a 21\-year old pregnant woman is very sick, she has been vomiting blood for the past two weeks\.

#### SLOVENIA
### Report of collective expulsions


> Processed under the readmission agreement, many people were denied their right to asylum procedure by the Slovenian police, still conducting systematic expulsions to Croatia under the guise of the readmission\. 





Threats, violence, abuse of power and denial of basic rights has became a common practice in other border police stations, collective expulsions to Croatia are happening daily with the knowledge and support of high police and government officials despite high risk of further violence and theft done by police in Croatia\.

A report was written by the Slovenian activists, documenting the continuing unlawful police practice at the border between Croatia and Slovenia\.

Read about it in [**AYS Special: Report on illegal practice of collective expulsion on Slovene\-Croatian border**](report-on-illegal-practice-of-collective-expulsion-on-slovene-croatian-border-e1210bf7dd8f)
#### AUSTRIA
### Deportation warning

We remind once again that a deportation in reportedly scheduled for **16 May from Vienna to Lagos, Nigeria\.**

The activists warn people who might be concerned to be aware the police will search for people at their known home addresses\. Police raids are also common at shops, clubs, restaurants, barber shops etc\., popular meeting points of African communities\.
They report that most recently, people get picked up just one or two days before the scheduled deportation charter flight so there‚Äôs no time for protest or similar actions\.

> Ramadan is hard for the Muslim refugees in Calais and across Europe\. Many are sleeping in the rough, living in the woods or in abandoned buildings\. Few have the facility to cook\. 





> We are doing all we can to help make this time a little brighter but we need your help\. We need volunteers to come and share their Ramadan by working with Care4Calais, and lots and lots of DATES ‚Äî for when the refugees break their fast\.

#### GERMANY
### European Council criticizes deportations from Germany


> ‚ÄúMethods that cause a suffocating feeling‚Äù and the squeezing of genitals need to be prohibited\. 




This is only the tip of the iceberg, as police beatings during deportations happen on a regular basis, the newest report concludes\.
The Council of Europe‚Äôs Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment has published the report on its ad hoc visit to Germany carried out from 13 to 15 August 2018\.

Among other recommendations, they state that it is crucial that no person is removed from Germany while appeal proceedings that have a suspensive effect are still pending before a court; this should be verified in practice by means of a ‚Äúlast call procedure‚Äù\. 
They seem to be critical of the practice of late or even last\-minute notification of returnees of their impending removal on the day of their scheduled flight\. We have written many times about the practice of night deportations, including those expelled under the Dublin agreement, even when there was no documentation for it and for example Croatia was tacitly accepting families to its Reception centre in Zagreb, unaware ad unprepared and ‚Äî not asking questions on how and why it happened\.

Persons at risk of self\-harm and/or suicide or with mental health problems should undergo a comprehensive medical assessment, the report adds\. Moreover, the existing complaints mechanism should be made **accessible and effective in practice** , including by providing adequate information to returnees on how to make a complaint\. This, of course, is far from being practiced and many are still struggling to receive full and clear information on a process that concerns them\.
