#### FEATURE

Undivided support and solidarity were visible at Terminal 1 of Frankfurt airport on Wednesday evening when about 500 people gathered to protest loudly the announced deportation of 27 people to Afghanistan\.

Afghan authorities confirmed the planned arrival of a deportation flight for Thursday morning in Kabul\.
Since December 2016 Germany has sent 128 people back to the country of origin via forced deportations\.

Germany officially claims that only refugees with a criminal record are deported to Afghanistan\. This is far from the truth, [c](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.spiegel.de%2Fpolitik%2Fdeutschland%2Fabschiebung-nach-kabul-vom-ausbildungsplatz-in-den-abschiebeflieger-a-1181980.html&h=ATPbtoKy5axszwaeVyqB81Dw8q_lGuTMf1_AGrDdfpGOyN0WF-C9H_wTxr0SiS3GWcCDXMXrqT9NmNpCPMREAkNR0HvWISdDwxYjf46eu1mkt0r3EI4dOaXLwxF243FgFSfHc1tZc1ptIIFTRyjZ_aY429nj3RP2zLijIq_OqBFxfZY_biRCT77vU0ehA8DTdDqeXtYs-6crmT3c3WD5ynfBxKpZ534sw7gqUXG8bcpjhQp64M5mMkQWAYFjMBo2) [laims](http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/abschiebung-nach-kabul-vom-ausbildungsplatz-in-den-abschiebeflieger-a-1181980.html) Bayerischer Flüchtlingsrat\. 
Nine out of the 20 Afghans who were deported today are from Bavaria\. Two of them have records that prove them to be offenders against the law\. The crime of the other seven is probably “not to have cooperated enough to clarify their identity”, say the activists\. One man showed his identity papers from Afghanistan “too late”\. The list of deportation candidates included two young men who, in the opinion of refugee activists and lawyers, are not in any of the three categories mentioned — including a young man who was to be deported from his training program in Bavaria\. According to a previous agreement, apprentices should not be deported during apprenticeship or for the following two years since there is a deficit of qualified workers in Germany\. It is not known why this was not applied in his case\. Bavaria reportedly has the most strict interpretation of the agreement on who should be deported\.

### SYRIA
### Widespread rape of boys and men — a [report](http://www.unhcr.org/news/latest/2017/12/5a27a4e04/male-rape-sexual-torture-widespread-syria-crisis-report.html)

Men are usually not considered to be “vulnerable” in whatever context — be it the Greek islands, Lebanese camps, reception centres in Europe or the program sheet of an NGO\. However, it is young boys and men who often bear the biggest stigma in society\. Unfortunately, along with war and fighting, their suffering continues in their countries of origin\. UNHCR has presented results and statistics related to the growing question and problem of sexual abuse\. Victims have accused armed groups within Syria of carrying out mass rapes, with sexual violence often occurring in detention or prison facilities\. One focus group of refugee women in Jordan estimated that between 30–40 percent of the adult men in their community were victims of sexual violence while in detention in Syria\.

Many have described shocking torture while in detention, including weapons being used as tools of rape\. The report noted that there is concern that the high rate of child labor among Syrian refugee boys, which, for example, is 94 percent in Jordan, leads to sexual exploitation and rape\. Refugee boys and men have reported that some employers refuse to pay wages until sexual acts are performed\. It has also been found that boys in countries of refuge are often targeted by older youths, with accounts of rape occurring in refugee communities on a daily basis\.

### It is a European, not just a Greek, responsibility


> The Greek government needs to spell out to its European partners what it requires in terms of concrete support immediately to improve reception conditions and the operations of its asylum system\. 
 

> EU member states could in turn support Greece by continuing the relocation of recognised refugees from the Greek mainland, suspending Dublin returns to Greece,…

### Overcrowded Lesvos needs help and volunteers


> We are in need of volunteers for the coming months, both for the North shore watch/response and for the warehouse to help with distribution at Moria\.
 

> It is possible to do both if you have the energy\.

According to reports, the government plans to transfer about 3,000 people from Lesvos to the mainland by December 10, but all stakeholders, the most important being refugees and the volunteers and aid workers who are actually on the field, consider this to be not nearly adequate to tackle the problem\.
### Chios

230 people perceived as ‘vulnerable’ were transferred from Chios to Piraeus by ferry today\. They will later on be lodged in different places across Greece where the UNHCR runs reception facilities\. This is part of the official efforts made to contribute to easing the burden on the Aegean islands, [commented](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amna.gr%2Fhome%2Farticle%2F211703%2F230-prosfuges-kai-metanastes-apo-eualotes-omades-taxideuoun-apo-ti-Chio-gia-Peiraia&h=ATOOKQ__CVzNB-sAZ-6OStgy7uc7H02Jpg1BuZ9PRfZc6EXBVEfWTZ_44NLht8hrGNyJEhMlNp-Pw-In-w6sUGUZmBQjsn5PTtQ8BsuWWH8Y5l20dGzYXh4WBaifsQgnOei6ekqeZg) the Greek media\. Many people continue to arrive to the islands, still the policies remain the same and more and more people are literally squeezed into inhumane spaces…

### A whole county protests the deportation of four young Iraqi men

The young men \(two pairs of brothers\) have been living in the county of Leogang \(3,300 inhabitants\) for several years, and were reportedly well integrated\. They work as volunteers, and some have jobs\. 
They might face death returning to Iraq, saying that several relatives were killed for political reasons\. 
After two of them received their denial, the county has been trying to help them by collecting money for the lawyer to appeal the decisions\.

Médecins du Monde will also distribute blankets and sleeping bags today in the Calais area\. Anyone who wants can sign a “loan agreement” — which means if the goods are confiscated by the police, as happens almost daily, the refugees/associations have the legal basis on which to request the return of their belongings\.

Men, children, women, a young man who was barefoot, another who was bitten by a police dog, some without jackets, some in tears because their brother was arrested and taken away …\. 
The team of HÉBERGEMENT PLATEFORME CITOYENNE finished their solidarity activities and left the Park at 2:30 in the morning after an exhausting evening/night\. \. :
