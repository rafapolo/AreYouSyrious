**FEATURE**

**The UK using Israel as a model for the transfer of asylum seekers to Rwanda, and Greece as a model for detention centres in the UK**

[In 2014, Israel secretly implemented the deportation of asylum seekers to Rwanda, knowing that this was breaking the 1951 UN Refugee Convention](https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/israel-uk-fortress-state-model-new-asylum-policy?fbclid=IwAR18zrJJVbxJbGT9PC9YpErUg0yydQs4LsERoDKCkIcjP2Yp6SgnFMWClH0) \.

This hidden element is evidently not part of the UK’s approach as the UK government has instead tried to justify this policy by stating it aims to prevent people\-smugglers from helping to transport asylum seekers across the Channel\. However, not only is it clear that the UK simply wants to outsource their responsibility onto another country, this argument is exceptionally weak and [the previous implementation of this policy by Israel completely counteracts this argument](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/04/20/britain-rwanda-refugees-asylum-kagame-authoritarianism/?tpcc=recirc_latest062921&fbclid=IwAR2HYuUtBdLhvEHw0Vqq_66JKXtWBIZKuRCptRULxVgzWf-lmfr-_ZGRF1c) \. Israel gave up on this scheme when it became evident that there was an incredibly high rate of exploitation, human smuggling, and modern\-day slavery for those who had been sent to Rwanda and were fleeing once again, on another dangerous journey\.

Rwanda further has a long history of corruption and human rights abuses, as seen by Lewis Mudge, the Central Africa director of Human Rights Watch:


> “Arbitrary detention, ill\-treatment, and torture in official and unofficial detention facilities are commonplace, and fair trial standards are flouted in many cases\.” 





Many who were sent to Rwanda from Israel between 2014 and 2017 found themselves in horrendous conditions and left the country soon after arriving\.

It is also important to note that Priti Patel has attempted to make similar deals with countries such as Ghana and Kenya, however these deals were rejected due to criticism from their citizens\. The UK government continues to attempt to leverage other countries to take on the responsibility of welcoming and resettling refugees and asylum seekers who are trying to reach the UK\.


> “The first world’s treatment of refugees is already shameful\. Developing countries [shelter 85 percent of asylum seekers](https://www.unhcr.org/statistics/unhcrstats/618ae4694/mid-year-trends-2021.html) , while western states host only 15 percent\. That disparity is only going to grow\.” 





This UNHCR statistic and statement by the Middle East Eye is further supported by Frank Habineza, the president of the Democratic Green Party of Rwanda who states:


> “How could a richer, bigger country be unable to host refugees and think they could just dump them in Rwanda because they have money\. It is unacceptable,”

Whilst the offshoring of asylum seekers has been a core discussion point in the UK recently, Andriani Fili looks at another strategy [the UK is developing which is based on Greece’s system of reception centres](https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/research-subject-groups/centre-criminology/centreborder-criminologies/blog/2022/04/modelling-uk?fbclid=IwAR1rRjKSM17QWL4Pb9FrU7QGP49x8-QbTpOizG-vz3znMtYocEyjSJWCZ4E) \.


> “Since the 1990s, immigration detention and refoulement practices have defined [Greece’s response](https://borderlandscapes.law.ox.ac.uk/regions/greece) \. The [asylum system](https://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/15206.html) , managed by an untrained and racist police force, [welcomed only a limited few](https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/greeceturkey1108web_0.pdf) \.” 





Despite policies being implemented to improve the immigration system, in 2015, the Greek immigration system was under a great deal of national and international criticism\. With the financial support of the European Commission in implementing a ‘hotspot approach’ in Greece, what followed was a disaster\. Camps were built in around 10 days, sometimes fewer\. They were cramped, people had limited access to welfare services, legal aid, and information about their immigration status\. Conditions were deemed inhumane, and exploitation, violence, trafficking, and sexual assault became the norm for many\.

Since 2019, there has been another change towards slowing the movement of asylum seekers and decongesting the Aegean islands\. This has led to the construction of high\-tech, closed camps, which are once again being funded by the European Union\. The camps on Samos, Leros and Kos are already up and running\.

Fili’s overall argument is that whilst the UK Home Secretary is impressed by the systems in Greece and aims to develop similar systems in small towns in the UK, this only reinforces the discriminatory, unequal, and inhumane approach being taken towards asylum seekers and refugees within the UK and across European countries\.


> If the UK government is after a model reception system that puts people under severe mental and physical stress and leaves them stranded within an enormous geographical, physical and psychological limbo, then, in Greece they have come to the right place\.

Immigration Minister, Mattias Tesfaye, argues this deal would;


> “…ensure a more dignified approach than the criminal network of human traffickers that characterises migration across the Mediterranean today” 





This initiative not only follows the UK’s announcement, but also continues Denmark’s pattern of establishing harsher border and immigration policies\. For instance, last year the government passed a law allowing refugees to be moved to asylum centres in partner countries\. However, they failed to find a partner country to work with\.

At the same time, Denmark aims to open four health clinics for Ukrainian refugees to ease the pressure on the country’s medical system\. [InfoMigrants](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/39979/denmark-to-open-medical-clinics-for-ukrainian-refugees) explores the very selective approach taken by Denmark towards Ukrainian refugees compared to non\-European refugees\.
