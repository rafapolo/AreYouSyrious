**FEATURE**

On the 10th April, Coalizione italiana per le libertà ed i diritti civili \(CILD\), Associazione studi giuridici sull’immigrazione \(ASGI\) and IndieWatch released a [report](https://www.asgi.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018410_Dossier-Lampedusa-per-sito.pdf) on the living conditions of new arrivals in the hotspot of Lampedusa\.

The hotspot has been under fire in the past months, not only for the uncertainty surrounding its closure, but also because the EU Anti\-Torture Committee [reported](https://rm.coe.int/16807b6d56) recently about the unbearable living conditions in Italian hotspots and detention centres\.

From the report, it emerges that in the hotspot there’s no canteen and the food that is being given is of very low quality\.

Toilets consist of a hole in the ground and the showers have no doors at all, violating the privacy of the people hosted\.

Mattresses are dirty and shabby and are located in huge rooms that can hold up to 36 people, with no separation among women, men and children\.

There are no bed sheets or, better, there are paper bed sheets; people can change them after few weeks, when they are clearly damaged\.

Hot water is secured for just 1 hour a day and running water is blocked from 9 PM to 7 AM, with the consequently accumulation of sewage in the bathrooms, few metres away where kids and adults sleep \(there is no door at all\! \) \.

There is no laundry in the centre, as well as no garden nor a place to pray\.

To the migrants hosted there is available just one bottle of water a day and there is no vending machine to buy water and/or food\.

Security conditions are absent, contributing to clear human rights violations, especially for the most vulnerable people hosted in the hotspot\.

“ _I was beaten numerous times by the police and by other adults\. Even a service dog bit me and the policemen laughed when it was biting me and did nothing_ ” — Ahmed, a minor

Especially people from Tunisia are hosted in the centre and most of them declared that, as soon as they arrived there, they expressed the will to seek asylum, but the process never started for them, they were not even given the chance to formulate a proper request\.

More cases are discussed in the report itself with pictures to testimony the ongoing abuses and suicidal or self harm attempts\.

**SYRIA**

Latest [updates](https://twitter.com/afp/status/984980207533633536?s=21) , after yesterday’s attacks, are that the UN Security Council met yesterday at 3 PM to discuss the situation after the attacks and “actions” to take\.

Turkey welcomed the attacks over Syria as an adequate “ _response to Assad’s inhumane attacks_ ”\.

Moreover, while Russia urged to the Security Council to condemn the military operations, diplomats already met to discuss actions to be taken\.

“ _Inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons \(OPCW\) have announced their arrival in Damascus_ \.” reports [AlJazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/04/syria-air-strikes-latest-updates-180414021423479.html) ; inspectors from The Hague will commence its work immediately\.

“ _The EU calls upon all countries, notably Russia and Iran, to use their influence to prevent any further use of chemical weapons, notably by the Syrian regime_ ,” _the_ _EU said in a statement\. It said the EU had imposed Syrian sanctions in July 2017 and March this year and was “always ready to consider imposing further measures as appropriate_ ”\.

Reactions from other worldwide leaders are also included in the article mentioned above\.
