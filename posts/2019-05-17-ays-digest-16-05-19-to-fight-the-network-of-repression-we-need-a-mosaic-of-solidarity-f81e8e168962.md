### AYS DIGEST 16/05/19: To Fight the Network of Repression, we need a Mosaic of Solidarity

_Finding the energy to keep going // SAR vessel still not given safe port // Volunteer opportunities across the region // Grand Canary Islands see an increase in arrivals — a new route?_


![IN Belgium, in memory of Mawda\. [Front AntiFasciste Liège 2\.0](https://www.facebook.com/FrontAntiFascisteLiege/?tn-str=k%2AF&hc_location=group_dialog)](assets/f81e8e168962/1*TEYeZOFmsoC-XrGP7MP-Dw.jpeg)

IN Belgium, in memory of Mawda\. [Front AntiFasciste Liège 2\.0](https://www.facebook.com/FrontAntiFascisteLiege/?tn-str=k%2AF&hc_location=group_dialog)

Activists in Belgium commemorated the anniversary of the death of Mawda, a young girl who was shot and killed by Belgian police who were in pursuit of the car in which she hid\. In the aftermath of her death, much like in the aftermath of the death of Little Madina Husseiny, those “concerned” about the safety of children chimed in about how if her parents had been responsible,


> Why did they even bring her on such a dangerous trip? 




As has been stated before, it becomes a tired refrain to hear on the lips of people who are just dancing around the issue\. Having to wade through all of these kindly\-phrased, bad faith arguments is frustrating on a variety of levels, and most of all because it feels like a waste of time\.

Meanwhile, those who despise people on the move seem to have been wasting no time\. Viktor Orban has been covered in several major media outlets and in the previous weeks had long meetings with Matteo Salvini \( [who Orban cited as being his pick for the ‘champion’ in the tussle for the future of the EU in opposition to France’s Emmanuel Macron](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/bernard-henri-levy-interviews-viktor-orban/589102/) \) and with President Trump\. President Trump, as expected, praised Orban for his role of being a “controversial presence” in Europe\.


> “You have been great with respect to Christian communities,” Trump told Orban\. “You have really put a block up and we appreciate that very much\.” 




We don’t really like to focus on Trump news — he continues to spout off as usual — but the fact is, his endorsement of Orban, his gusto lies in backing alt\-right and far right outlets \(in the name of freedom of speech and anti\-censorship\) who peddle conspiracy theories; conspiracy theorists such as Lauren Southern, who last year published a poorly edited “gotcha” video insinuating that NGOs are facilitating the overrun of Europe through supporting refugees\. She’s the same woman who, along with members of the Identitarian movement, attempted to thwart a Search and Rescue operation in the Mediterranean, an event that she now categorically denies in a funny twist\.

The language of these outlets can be found in the Christchurch Shooter’s manifesto, railing about the replacement of White Christian Europe with a Non\-White Islamic one\. Indeed the links between the Christchurch shooter and the [Identitarian movement are no matter of mere speculation](https://www.hopenothate.org.uk/2019/05/15/more-links-between-generation-identity-and-christchurch-mosque-killer-emerge/) , with shooter Tarrant having donated nearly two thousand dollars to far right Austrian activist Martin Sellner\. In the aftermath of the Christchurch shootings, there was some debate about “whether the shootings were Islamophobic or White Supremacist,” though these are not in conflict with one another\.


> White Supremacy and the defense of a “Christian Europe” go hand in hand\. Defending Christianity is synonymous with Defending Europe\. The performance of, “Defending Christianity to Perform \(White\) Europeanness,” is the cultural elephant in the room\. 




The revelation of this trope of defending Christianity as being what it is \(namely, a dog whistle for white supremacy\) is demonstrated quite easily when we see Christians, particularly high profile Christian figures such as, for example, the Pope come out in support of refugees\. Now Orban, the self\-proclaimed “ [most Christian, and thus the most European, of Europeans](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/bernard-henri-levy-interviews-viktor-orban/589102/) ” finds himself at odds with the head of his faith\.

However, this assault on the humanity of those who move is not coming exclusively from the Christian right\. In response to right\-wing populism, many on the left have been clamping down on immigration\. The [leader of the Social Democrats in Denmark has a decidedly draconian take on immigration](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/11/denmark-election-matte-frederiksen-leftwing-immigration) , supporting a requirement of immigrants to work 37 hours a week in order to obtain benefits, although this is ostensibly under the guise of her criticism of open borders being abused by businesses to import cheap labor and undermine the worker in Denmark\.

Although the reliance upon the idea of, “refugees should be welcomed as we need them for our economy,” is one that we have strongly criticized \(and Emmanuel Macron could hardly be called a “friend” to refugees\), a thorough investigation into this kind of left\-branded closed borders rhetoric yields that it is essentially doing the work of the oppressor — taking out one’s anger at a broken system against the most powerless\. Indeed, the far right happily dips into this rhetoric, spinning tales of open border plots by rich executives \(often heavily laden in anti\-semitic tropes\) whilst granting more freedoms to large corporate entities\.

_So what_ ?

It is important to follow developments of the attack on people on the move which transcend the political spectrum, religious spectrum, and create a complex network of politicians, media outlets, pop culture figures, and others\.

_What now?_

As we see the breadth and diversity of this network, we need to boost up those performing solidarity work\. Although political victories are of great value, we have to focus our support on a variety of fronts\. For example, we’ve long seen how the struggle of the homeless on many fronts is held in common with the struggle of people on the move\. In many cases, they are synonymous\.

Two days ago, [Cardinal Konrad Krajewski, an aide to the Pope, re\-enabled the electricity](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/05/13/konrad-krajewski-pope-francis-aide-turned-power-homeless/1187795001/) for an “illegally\-occupied building,” drawing the ire of our favourite man Matteo Salvini who was discouraged at his encouragement of “illegal activity”\. The power had been gone for a week due to unpaid bills, but Krajewski, when asked, explained that he could not bear to see children without hot water or electricity and will continue to pay the bills\. Other [priests in Assisi have stated that,](https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2019/05/14/elemosiniere-del-papa-i-frati-di-assisi-si-schierano-dalla-sua-parte-se-quello-che-ha-fatto-e-illegale-arrestateci-tutti/5179108/) “if what he has done is illegal, arrest us all\.”

It is unclear whether or not this building was occupied by people on the move, stateless and those seeking asylum, but homelessness and people who are seeking refuge tend to be found on two sides of the same coin\. Legislation that is used to oppress one marginalized group will be handily used against the other, [and many are done under the same heading of “security” and “hygiene](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/homeless-suffers-winter-harsh-hungarian-law-harsher-190113114450231.html) \.” People punished for the crime of misfortune, for being without resource, for being without a home\.

As was [covered several days before](ays-daily-digest-14-05-2019-open-arms-dismissed-of-charge-for-aiding-illegal-immigration-e9fc82e22851) , a win of solidarity can be seen in one case of a Biagio Conte’s dramatic hunger strike in order to prevent the deportation of a man to Ghana\.

Although these actions sometimes work and sometimes do not, and although the political mechanisms often seek to close any gaps that are found in the legislation, by standing together and creating our own intricate mosaic of solidarity and support, we can continue\.

Although we do need to continue to investigate and monitor what those who oppose us are doing, we should not be disheartened nor should we feed on it exclusively, as that will create a poison that kills our fire\. Focus also on the victories and get inspired to how we can create them around us\.


> Great or small, we need to work, while keeping our eye on how those against us do, without being disheartened\. By staying committed to ourselves and our friends, we will build something\.
