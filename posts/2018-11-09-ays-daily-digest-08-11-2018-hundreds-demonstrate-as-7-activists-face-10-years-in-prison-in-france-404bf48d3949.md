#### FEATURE: Hundreds demonstrate as seven protesters in France face 10 years in prison and 750,000 € in fines for ‘aiding illegal immigration and organized gangs’

On April 22, 2018, a spontaneous demonstration that crossed the border between Italy and France took place against an organised group of people who were ‘guarding’ the border at Colle della Scala and preventing people from crossing to France\.


> In hundreds, we walked on the road, for 18 kilometers, from Claviere to Briançon\. Together we have arrived there\. Together, for that day, we made sure that the border did not exist\. 





In Briançon, three people were arrested and jailed for 11 days and charged with ‘aiding illegal immigration and organized gangs\.’ Subsequently another four people were charged with the same crimes\.


> In this era of the return of fascisms, of widespread racism, of exploitation of the fear of the different, we call to solidarity\. 





The trial took place today\.

**EASO have compiled a new report on Pakistan\.** 
The report aims to provide information on the security situation in Pakistan, which is relevant for international protection status determination\. The report briefly describes the situation as follows: “The security situation in Pakistan is complex and influenced by factors such as political violence, insurgent violence, ethnic conflicts, and sectarian violence\. The domestic security situation is also influenced by disputes with the neighbouring countries of India and Afghanistan that occasionally turn violent\.”

They had been at sea for 19 hours at the time of the call and required urgent assistance\.

European authorities, including the Italian and Maltese coast guards were contacted\. The Italian Coast guard denied all responsibility and refused to help\.

The boat was eventually ‘rescued’ by the Libyan coast guard\.


> In this case, the ‘rescue’ of the 100 people would mean their return into conditions of confinement, torture, extortion, and sexual violence — conditions that they were trying to escape from\.We strongly demand European authorities to assume responsibility again and conduct search and rescue operations\. There are plenty of rescue assets that could engage but what is missing is the political will in this current racist anti\-migrant climate\. 





> Europe has handed over the mandate to the Libyan authorities to abduct people in precarious situations at high sea\. We fail to find words for the perversity of the situation — with torture or death seemingly being the only options left for people seeking safety in Europe\.

**Conditions on Samos are Getting Worse**

Organisations report that the population of the camp has grown to a size that was previously not thought possible\. Intended to house 700 people, it is currently housing 4500\. There are currently approximately 1000 children living in the camp and over 300 pregnant women\. Last week Samos received 55% of all the people who arrived in Greece, despite the lower amount of services available compared to other islands, which are also severely overcrowded\.


> The overcrowding brings increased tension and strain\. There are stories of food shortages, and people waking up at 5am to stand for hours in line for breakfast, often to be sent away empty handed\. Pop\-up beach tents house entire families, set up on rocky platforms in an attempt to stop flooding when the rains hit the dry earth\.

**People continue to return to Grand\-Synthe after Evacuation** 
Two weeks ago, over 1500 people were forcefully cleared from Grand\-Synthe, Dunkirk\. People are now returning to the area\. With winter approaching and makeshift accomodations destroyed by the police, they are forced to sleep rough in conditions worse than before the place was cleared\.

**Donations Needed in Paris** 
Many people are sleeping rough in Paris and there is an urgent need for tents and shoes\. Over the past two weeks [Paris Refugee Ground Support](https://www.facebook.com/PRGS.team/?tn-str=k%2AF) have distributed over 200 tents, but more are needed\.

Minors are currently being housed in poorly equipped accommodation while they wait for the Red Cross to make assessments\. Video footage shows that the place is full of cockroaches and bedbugs\. Minors are given a kebab to eat each weekday but no food on weekends\.
