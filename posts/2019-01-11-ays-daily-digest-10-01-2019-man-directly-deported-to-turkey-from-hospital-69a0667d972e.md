### FEATURE

Deportation Monitoring Aegean published [worrying news](https://dm-aegean.bordermonitoring.eu/2019/01/10/severely-injured-individual-deported-directly-from-hospital-on-18th-october-2018/?fbclid=IwAR24ovZGBdfISg71Vo2SpfnnaM5dpLsa6kOosW5uQOMPtP1JBB-enCTTsR8) concerning the deportation, back in October, of a man from the hospital where he was admitted directly to Turkey\.

The man was living in Moria and, on October 17th, 2018, he received the news that he was going to be deported to Turkey the next day\. He, then, tried to reach his friend through the pay phone but was unable to receive help\. Desperate, he tried to commit suicide by swallowing shampoo and deeply cutting his stomach the morning he was scheduled for the deportation\.

Police took him to the hospital in Mytilene and just recently it was discovered that the man was taken directly to the police station and subsequently deported to Turkey, together with other four people\.


> Former detainees in the pre\-removal prison explained that in the following weeks, the police decided to close the pay phone in prison on Wednesday evenings, so that even people with phone cards were unable to call friends or lawyers after being informed about their upcoming deportation \(detainees in Moria prison only have access to their mobile phones on the weekends\) \. 




The news comes after the publication of a new report by Oxfam, highlighting how the EU is turning a blind eye on the situation of refugees stranded in Europe, and in Greece in particular \(7,551 people just in Moria\) \.

As the report lists all the failures of the system and the lack of assistance, it is unbelievable to understand that “ _as the last government\-appointed camp doctor on the Greek island of Lesvos quit in November 2018, vulnerability assessments have not taken place at all for at least a month\.”_

The procedure to assess vulnerability of newcomers changed three times over the past year, creating confusion, dismay among the population and the staff, as well as obvious delays in the official recognitions of vulnerability\.

The shortage of staff \(medical and interpreters\) and their under\-qualification make the whole procedure more painful\.


> Joysin, a 28\-years old man from Cameroon, was detained upon arrival in Lesvos despite having serious mental health issues\. He was released after three months, and soon after, the Greek authorities identified him as vulnerable\. He is now living in a tent in Moria, waiting for more suitable accommodation that suits his needs\. \[…\] In detention, Joysin’s mental state deteriorated: “I couldn’t sleep\. I was sick, anxious and had bad thoughts\. When I slept, I had nightmares\. I needed help, but it took one month before I could see a psychologist\.”

### MEDITERRANEAN

While we are happy that the 49 people on board of the Sea Watch and Sea Eye were finally able to disembark, after an odyssey that lasted for almost 20 days, other news are coming from another part of Europe’s southern border\.

[Spain rescued yesterday 169 people](https://twitter.com/walkingborders/status/1083286261685776384?fbclid=IwAR0GtwxSCrhlwXl9YjuvdF8YD4oF6Er3RtwvipwyPezkWqeCvwFvAMOpo-w) , among them 35 women and nine children, but another 71 remain missing over the last three days, including 14 women\.

What is more unsettling is that an additional 141 people, on board of two different boats, are also [missing as of the last two days](https://twitter.com/HelenaMaleno/status/1083248249526456327?fbclid=IwAR08iqsFUn9X4y9uIQg4U8cHnc8YltGox_z28l_ZC9e4P-JbSeT76xCwBJ8) in the Alboran Sea\.

### GREECE

A total of [47,929 people reached Greece in 2018](http://www.ekathimerini.com/236443/article/ekathimerini/news/migrant-influx-through-evros-tripled-last-year-minister-says?fbclid=IwAR3JH-W6sq_YnDQvV8bh9xz_VXEVdX8DAxgtXOomoSUby7fHYvzXz2xutK0) , while only 6,558 were reported to have left the country in the same period\.

Of the around 70,000 asylum seekers present in the country, around 11,000 people are stuck in five islands\.

Of notice is also the increased amount of entries from the land border between Greece and Turkey, where 15,814 people on the move have crossed, three times more if compared to the previous year\.
#### Islands

[Donations](https://www.facebook.com/HopeProjectKempsons/posts/2238599286421191?hc_location=ufi) of blankets and sleeping bags in particular are needed for the Hope Project\.

Because We Carry is also organising collections of [donations of hot water bottles](https://www.facebook.com/Becausewecarry/posts/919031114962163?hc_location=ufi) \.

Weather conditions in Lesvos are not getting any better\.

### ITALY

Despite the horrible news occupied by Italy in these days, there is always another face that is worth showing and speaking about, the face of solidarity and humanity\.

This morning, [51 Kurdish people \(among them six women, four children and one new born baby\) were rescued](https://www.fanpage.it/crotone-barca-con-51-migranti-si-incaglia-sugli-scogli-i-cittadini-accorrono-a-salvarli/) and supported by the local population of Melissa \(Crotone, Calabria\), when the sailing boat on which they were travelling hit some rocks and got stuck\.

Locals alerted the authorities and the services, but were the first to offer help to bring the people ashore and to a shelter where they were able to dry themselves and change clothes\.

Migrants are now at the reception centre of Sant’Anna, nearby, for identification procedures\.
### FRANCE

After having his asylum request rejected, a 23\-year\-old Sudanese man named Ali was due to be deported at any moment\.

On December 19th, five police officers came to his cell at the Oissel detention center, near Rouen, shut him in a small room, and beat and insulted him until 5am, when they drove him to the Roissy airport to board a flight back to Khartoum\.

“ _They hit me all over my body_ ,” Ali said in an official complaint\. At the airport, he tried to run away, but the police forced him to the ground, hitting him until he lost consciousness\. He was transferred to another small room, where they ostensibly waterboarded him, before a doctor intervened, put an end to the torture, and determined that Ali wasn’t eligible for deportation due to a heart condition\.

In his deposition, Ali concluded: “ _I was shocked by the border police’s particularly violent comportment at the airport_ \.” A member of a refugee support association who saw Ali after the attack testified: “ _When I saw him, I didn’t recognize him\. I’m ashamed of what happened_ \.”

### GERMANY

Afghanistan has denied entry to a deported asylum seeker from Germany, as he has been diagnosed with mental illness and, due to an agreement between the two countries, could not be deported back to the country of origin\.

He is now being detained in a detention centre around Münich, awaiting a revision of his case\.

### SWEDEN

Four people have been [deported back](https://www.facebook.com/AmasoAfg/posts/2291916910838580) to Afghanistan yesterday; chances are, they were tricked into signing voluntary return papers\.
