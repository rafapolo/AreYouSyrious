#### FEATURE
#### New Closed Structure in Samos Open

Notis Mitarakis inaugurated the h [ighly\-criticized new center](https://www.efsyn.gr/ellada/koinonia/311043_egkainiase-o-n-mitarakis-monos-toy-domi-fylaki-gia-prosfyges) in the Zervos area of Samos, notably without any higher level representatives from the EU or any local representation whatsoever present\. Despite the government’s insistence that the camp is an improvement, the opening was [met with protests](https://www.facebook.com/europemustact/posts/376887340590633) by people on the move, solidarity workers, and local residents who are against the prison\-like conditions\.

The center can host 3,000 people in a prison\-like structure where people on the move will be surrounded by barbed wire and heavily controlled entrances and exits\. There are even metal detectors at the entrance, adding to the feeling of a prison\. Upon arriving, one man even said “ [welcome to the jail of Samos](https://twitter.com/f_grillmeier/status/1439861601272729600) \.” Although the EU insisted at the beginning of this process that the structures would not be closed, but “ [controlled access,](https://twitter.com/we_are_solomon/status/1439937397018484741) ” it’s clear that was just a facade\.

Authorities started transferring people to the [new center today](https://www.facebook.com/24samos/posts/4232942090167666) and everyone should be moved by tomorrow\. The transfers happened with the cooperation of public transportation and a heavy police presence, [including drones](https://twitter.com/f_grillmeier/status/1439826864806244365?fbclid=IwAR23FVYwa2x4BGbeSfKUebX1BqN5ebRTgamGMyyMXXgirTUJU5K5PaVMFFE) \.

Many people are in distress at the restrictive conditions, which are not acceptable for children or adults\. One of the children in the new camp is Lena, who is [only 16 days old](https://www.facebook.com/daphne.tolis/posts/10158666605912371) \. Hopefully, she will not grow up only knowing barbed wire fences and guards\. [MSF reported](https://twitter.com/MSF_Sea/status/1439836312647897089?fbclid=IwAR2QeBPdzrW0t7CC_3kaQyn_vRGUMI95NpUkPY_ZNhD1BzNB465pPm_ViPQ) that they are worried about the psychological state of many of their patients, who are rightfully afraid about the conditions in the new camp\.

People are also worried about the strict rules in the new camp, including whether or not they will be [allowed to have pets](https://www.facebook.com/daphne.tolis/posts/10158665904352371) \(Greek authorities said “some” would be allowed\) \. Camp officials have even said that people who violate camp rules will see their asylum decisions affected, although there is no clarity about [which rules are so important](https://twitter.com/lk2015r/status/1440005080997040129?fbclid=IwAR03DESqZq2eVGuF6MQvDuNeb_-aLUaWXzVCEdk51cnxFOWBDXMgXHTAMEM) that they take precedent over the international right to asylum or the arbitration process\.

Although the government says that people will only stay in the camp for a few months, they said the same about the other, open\-air camps, where many people have been trapped for years\. [This documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvNSBiLyVBY) interviews several people that were in the old camp on Samos for over two years and are still waiting for their asylum claims to be processed—how much longer will they have to wait in the prison\-like camp?

Official government communications have focused on the shiny new buildings in the camp and how it’s a sign of change in the current practice \(although even [official communications](https://twitter.com/BrunoTersago/status/1439910119924457477) know enough about PR that they strategically hid the barbed wire, metal detectors, and other intense security measures\) \. However, we must be diligent about calling the conditions in this camp for what they are—repressive and dehumanizing—and supporting the people on the ground fighting for their dignity\.

#### LIBYA
#### Families Demand Safe Return of Their Loved Ones

Families of hundreds of Moroccans who are detained in inhumane conditions in Libyan prisons for people on the move are [asking the government](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/35170/libya-moroccan-families-demand-safe-return-of-detained-migrants?fbclid=IwAR1B2NUvyKia0-MWQA8guoucqmxsOS-juwf0ee0tNF4QqoGQyM2Q91rwKVA) to intervene and help their loved ones\. Many have been held for months in camps with no adequate access to food or water, without any legal proceedings against them\.
#### SEA
#### New Rescues in the Mediterranean

The MSF rescue ship the Geo Barents rescued 6 people from the Libyan SAR zone\. Later in the day, they [rescued 54 people](https://twitter.com/MSF_Sea/status/1439952630256709638?fbclid=IwAR003OEq0cLnLfrI1fbCcnxljh_DuYWE3IzWnPKR-fxlMBY-tWNJ4U4-1KE) that cried out in relief at finally leaving the suffering that they went through in Libya\.

Meanwhile, [13 more people](https://www.europapress.es/internacional/noticia-barcos-msf-sos-mediterranee-efectuan-nuevos-rescates-mediterraneo-20210920165814.html?fbclid=IwAR2hE-JqJ0tFTF6TV55rIUUaVPp9MJ15twFfMi15Jd3YBObq4PEN4dX82h8) joined the 120 still on board the Ocean Viking\. [Two people](https://www.facebook.com/SOSMEDITERRANEE/posts/4367805456660062) were evacuated to Italy along with their families due to medical issues\. The rest are still on board\.

Italy has said that it is expecting more [signs of solidarity](https://www.ansamed.info/ansamed/en/news/nations/europe/2021/09/20/sign-of-solidarity-on-migrants-necessary-from-eu-lamorgese_e9133f56-fc47-48e6-adf3-5045c3ea5c6a.html?fbclid=IwAR0ckeuCPL0k06gVghHymvkbrmV--aUDQBM9umoRNUhk5Z_Fm-xlsgLwADY) from the European Union as it cannot resettle everyone rescued at sea by itself\. However, that is still no excuse to prolong giving people a safe port\.
#### GREECE
#### Boat in Distress Near Mani

A boat with [32 people in distress](https://twitter.com/VassilisTsarnas/status/1440058763277258756?fbclid=IwAR1-tCD01uMlH0emicTG39RDqm_LxEUh39sJHrKaBDZWpQgT8XUKI0I0Sjs) was adrift last night near Mani, a peninsula in southern Greece\. The boat started drifting in the early afternoon on Monday and there is no update now as to their condition\. The people called 112 to ask for help, but were told that once they reached port they would be [deported back to Turkey](https://www.efsyn.gr/ellada/dikaiomata/311173_skafos-me-prosfyges-akybernito-st-anoihta-toy-tainaroy) \. Already authorities were circling the boat with no attempt to help\.

Where are the people now? They must be taken to safety and have access to their right to seek asylum\!
#### SERBIA
#### People Squatting in Forest in Awful Conditions

People from Klikaktiv [visited a forest squat](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=590280352105419) where people on the move are attempting to make a living, despite muddy conditions and lack of access to medical care and other basic necessities\.

However, for many of the people, this is better than one of the formal camps\. Many have experiences with abuse and forced labor at the hands of camp workers\. Others are concerned about the cramped conditions that make it impossible to social distance\.
#### MALTA
#### Flights Resume to Libya

For the first time in years, there was a [commercial flight](https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/malta-libya-flights-resume-with-silvio-schembri-among-the-passengers.902021?fbclid=IwAR0BpXhAKFcBl3Y7P9fO8gacExzPS9t9dpqqIISefVw7DI7VaaChZyxhJlg) from Malta to Libya\. Malta is the first EU country to reestablish flight ties and diplomatic relations with Libya\.

Given the history of Malta refusing to rescue people escaping Libya in distress, it is hard not to worry about these growing ties as a precursor to more pushbacks\.
#### SPAIN
#### Over 100 People Seeking Asylum in Spanish Exclave Pushed Back

[Around 125 people](https://twitter.com/CEARefugio/status/1440023469987704838?fbclid=IwAR0RvkMAUoyi96rdlx6h8GwUn9dyukGBUEBP5F5LW94Q1TX_jepxfxQqbfc) arrived at Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera, a small Spanish exclave connected to Morocco, and asked for asylum\. They were in contact with organizations like CEAR and AlarmPhone\. The local military base gave them water and took down their information\. Immediately, the people were surrounded [by Moroccan soldiers](https://www.cear.es/comunicado-sobre-la-situacion-de-los-solicitantes-de-asilo-en-velez-de-la-gomera/) and expressed fears of being pushed back to Morocco\.

It turns out that their fears were well\-founded\. After a day spent in limbo, the people were [pushed back to Morocco](https://twitter.com/LaSer_Melilla/status/1440043227663384583?fbclid=IwAR3t18YV-Om3k_LEI9XekTfPb4zBZSlntsL891ZInwPMDclPIailkxsPNag) even though almost all had expressed their intention to seek asylum\. The Spanish government justified this violation of international law by pointing to the precedent of sending people on the [islands in its control](https://elpais.com/espana/2021-09-20/espana-devuelve-a-marruecos-a-125-inmigrantes-que-habian-entrado-en-un-penon-espanol-frente-a-alhucemas.html?fbclid=IwAR1-tCD01uMlH0emicTG39RDqm_LxEUh39sJHrKaBDZWpQgT8XUKI0I0Sjs) off the North African coast back to Morocco—but la Gomera is not an island, it is a peninsula\.

This is not the only instance of Spain using its exclaves as a place to conduct violations of national and international law\. In Ceuta, the Spanish government is still denying people the [right to register](https://www.facebook.com/NoNameKitchenBelgrade/posts/1321773934887554) , even to those that have lived in the city for decades\.
#### BELGIUM
#### Stop the Scheduled Deportation of a Nigerian Dissident

Getting the Voice Out shared the story of a man scheduled to be deported on Tuesday, September 21st, on a Frontex flight to Lagos\. The man’s asylum claim was denied twice by Belgian authorities even though he is a member of a political opposition movement and has a reasonable fear of death if deported\. [Go here](https://www.gettingthevoiceout.org/attempted-deportation-on-a-frontex-flight-on-21-09-2021/?fbclid=IwAR2JJXF2mNesFJm51hR0iHiQCAK__gHU-HuDsEwALSqv1yUL718RoDQ6XZg) to learn about what action you can take to stop this\.
#### NETHERLANDS
#### Dutch Authorities Against Giving More Rights to Rejected Asylum Seekers

The EU is attempting to adjust the framework on voluntary returns for asylum seekers, but it was [opposed by the Netherlands](https://euobserver.com/migration/152956?fbclid=IwAR1nATfEWcqVznQA4P5OveWdrN6vfDTuQtm9zxqCinQnxDaIsIfOO-vKnOA) because it would give people more rights\. The leaked document was in response to an EU move to make Frontex take over more deportations\.
#### POLAND
#### Four People Found Dead in Border Zone

[Yesterday](ays-weekend-digest-18-19-9-21-will-the-deaths-at-the-border-with-belarus-provoke-action-to-protect-3e74b8e72e66) , we reported on the deaths of four people in the Poland\-Belarus border zone\. For more on this story, check out [this article](https://balkaninsight.com/2021/09/20/four-migrants-found-dead-on-poland-belarus-border/?fbclid=IwAR2pRQ3-yLiEUEp7mTtytWdSIw0CNdHJwyP9_JC7gmb9BP3bjrpd7-zJvRI) from Balkan Insight\.
#### UK
#### Borders Bill Contains Biometric Travel Scheme

The UK’s proposed Borders Bill has drawn the most attention for its attack on asylum rights, but it also contains provisions that could affect the privacy of tens of millions of people\. Under the new “ [permission to travel](https://www.statewatch.org/news/2021/september/uk-biometric-permission-to-travel-scheme-in-borders-bill-will-affect-tens-of-millions-of-people/?fbclid=IwAR2hE-JqJ0tFTF6TV55rIUUaVPp9MJ15twFfMi15Jd3YBObq4PEN4dX82h8) ” scheme, travelers who do not require a visa would still have to provide private information, including biometric data, to travel\.

Even as the government attempts to push the Borders Bill through, it is facing pushback for its other actions\. The Home Office is [back in court](https://www.kentlive.news/news/kent-news/priti-patel-faces-high-court-5938483?fbclid=IwAR2h5kONyY4AHEXz6neWVuBqksjjJ1hyZ-XpNRdBpSG2V1Om87PZD7B2yps) after refusing to remove people from the Napier Barracks, months after the High Court ruled that it was unfit for habitation\. The government extended plans to house asylum seekers there with a Special Development Order that bypassed the usual planning process and any input from local people\.
