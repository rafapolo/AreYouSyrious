[On October 15th, the Greek police said in a statement that 92 individuals were found naked in the Evros region, by the Turkish border\.](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greek-police-find-dozens-naked-migrants-border-with-turkey-2022-10-15/?fbclid=IwAR1DWQfb6FPlNfMcg1JM_Qf2yx_qRH_VzlyqzUD4nPo_EIY8lgcuAqMyWRI) It remains unclear how the men came to be unclothed, as Turkey and Greece blamed one another for the degrading and humiliating treatment of these people\.

Notis Mitarachi portrayed Turkey as a ‚Äòdisgrace to civilisation‚Äô, whilst Turkey‚Äôs Communications Director Fahrettin Altun denied all responsibility, and accused Greece of spreading disinformation and disrespecting people by sharing such photos publicly\.

Little else is known about these men at the moment of writing, and UNHCR has called for a full investigation\.

#### SEARCH AND RESCUE \(SAR\)
#### SAR failures off Morocco result in the deaths of more than 20 people

On October 13th Alarm Phone alerted the Spanish coastguard to a boat in distress and adrift, carrying 56 people\. The Spanish _Salvamento_ confirmed that the Moroccan coastguard was conducting the operation, yet only thirty people were rescued the following day\. An entire day of ‚Äòcommunication‚Äô and delegation indirectly inflicted death: the failure to carry out swift SAR operations illustrates a policy\-directed lack of human compassion, which violates international maritime laws\.

Amnesty International have responded to the news that Lebanon‚Äôs General Security agency will start repatriating Syrian refugees next week in a ‚Äòvoluntary process‚Äô\. Diana Semaan writes that Syrian refugees are not in a position to take a ‚Äúfree and informed decision about their return due to restrictive government policies on movement and residency, lack of access to essential services, \[not to mention the\] unavailability of objective and updated information about the current human rights situation in Syria\.‚Äù


> ‚ÄúIn enthusiastically facilitating these returns, the Lebanese authorities are knowingly putting Syrian refugees at risk of suffering from heinous abuse and persecution upon their return to Syria\. Lebanon should respect its obligations under international law and halt its plans to return Syrian refugees en\-masse\.‚Äù 





Amnesty highlights that international law prohibits what is known as **‚Äúconstructive** ‚Äù refoulement ‚Äî i\.e\. when the conditions for ‚Äòvoluntary‚Äô refoulement are ‚Äòconstructed‚Äô: the coercion of individuals, by a state, to return to a place where they would be at real risk of human rights violations\.

A ‚Äòvoluntary‚Äô decision borne of unfair Lebanese governmental policies does not, according to Amnesty, constitute a free\-willed choice\. In 2021 Amnesty [documented](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/09/syria-former-refugees-tortured-raped-disappeared-after-returning-home/) the sexual violence, detention, torture and enforced disappearance faced by returning Syrian refugees in the past\. The risk to those who left Syria at the start of the conflict are real and life\-threatening\.

The Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to human rights defenders in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine\. Notably, Ales Bialiatski, who was jailed by Lukashenko‚Äôs government in July 2021, was one of the prize‚Äôs recipients\. Ukrainian organisation _Center for Civil Liberties_ and Russian organisation _Memorial_ were also recipients\. The Nobel Commitee‚Äôs decision sends a message of solidarity to the courage of civil society to stand up to repression and violence, which _Article 19_ call a recognition of _‚Äúthe persistent and long\-standing plight of the recipients to strengthen the sense of unity among the people and ensure their democratic rights in the face of unabated repression launched by autocrats residing in Moscow and Minsk_ \.‚Äù
#### ITALY
#### Protests against Italy\-Libya Memorandum ‚Äî ‚ÄòThe EU kills without touching‚Äô

On October 15th, thousands of people protested on Italian streets and in front of the country‚Äôs European Embassies and Consulates, shouting ‚ÄòSTOP MEMORANDUM ITALY\-LIBYA\.‚Äô


![[https://mediterranearescue\.org/news/stop\-memorandum\-italia\-libia\-il\-racconto\-della\-giornata\-dalle\-piazze\-ditalia\-e\-deuropa/](https://mediterranearescue.org/news/stop-memorandum-italia-libia-il-racconto-della-giornata-dalle-piazze-ditalia-e-deuropa/)](assets/68537dea2b69/0*GO1_m98_TMNXqjT1.jpg)

The protests were focused upon spotlighting the cynical nature of the deal: the outsourcing of violence against people on the move by Europe, funding the so\-called Libyan coastguard\. Their work increasingly seeks to deter migration and asylum through the excessive and illegal use of violence, as well as the criminalisation of human rights activists\. Thousands of people have been removed to Libya, abused and arbitrarily detained under this Frontex\-backed agreement\. As David Yambio said:

#### Trieste‚Äôs citizens call for asylum seekers to be given shelter in the void of government inaction

Hundreds of citizens have signed an open letter asking authorities to guarantee shelter to those living night and day on Piazza Libert√† \[Freedom Square\] as the winter settles in across the northern Italian city\. The letter reads:


> ‚ÄúThey are looking for a place to seek refuge from the cold and the rain in the complete indifference of the institutions which should be placing these people in emergency shelters\.‚Äù 





The letter has recommended several large buildings across the city that might be used to offer temporary winter accommodation ‚Äî proactive steps can and must be taken\.

#### UNITED KINGDOM
#### ‚ÄúFailures of governance‚Äù in the Home Office

Judges have ruled that the Home Office unlawfully targeted people arriving to the UK in small boats, and that this ‚Äòfailure of governance‚Äô leaves over 1300 asylum seekers eligible to claim compensation for seized phones\.

Diane Taylor writes in [_The Guardian_](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/oct/14/asylum-seekers-claim-compensation-phones-seized-uk?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other&fbclid=IwAR3qsSC09bQYdFDuIKk4tDytlEKGrOJCHAQIQ86BUKeRS2pVbR5sK9wu2nE) that:

_‚ÄòLord Justice Edis and Mr Justice Lane ruled: ‚ÄúWe are concerned with a failure of governance which allowed an unlawful policy to operate for an unknown period of time\.‚Äù_

_While acknowledging that everyone was under pressure due to the ‚Äúcrisis of mass migration into the UK‚Äù and the political and media interest this attracted, the judges made reference to government officials who ‚Äúsidestepped‚Äù and ‚Äúducked‚Äù the issue of how the policy to seize phones was applied\.‚Äô_

#### Elsewhere, the Home Office has withdrawn the Rwanda deportation letter issued to an Eritrean refugee who is 37 weeks pregnant

After the story was featured in mainstream media, the Home Office has thankfully U\-turned on this particular decision\. However, it exemplifies the callous, quota\-filling approach to immigration that exists in the UK today\.

_Care4Calais_ write that


> ‚ÄúThe Government knows this woman is pregnant but have still seen fit to issue a letter threatening forced deportation to Rwanda\. This case demonstrates the lack of compassion, cruelty and brutality at the heart of the Government‚Äôs Rwanda policy\.‚Äù

#### DENMARK
#### Syrian women face deportation from Denmark, but men are allowed to stay

A number of Syrian women in their early 20s currently find themselves in ‚Äòsending positions‚Äô, awaiting deportation\. Before their residence permits were revoked, they were in both education and work\. The only members of their families to have their permits revoked, some of these women have already been placed in K√¶rshovedg√•rd‚Äôs detention centre\. Men of conscription age and minors are still allowed to remain ‚Äòtemporarily‚Äô, so Denmark‚Äôs assessment of Syria as ‚Äòsafe‚Äô has singled out these women to be deported\.

This is the stance of the Danish Social Democrat Party‚Äôs Immigration and Integration Minister:


> When you are here as a refugee, you are here temporarily\. And this applies regardless of whether you are unemployed, in work, in education or retired, because everyone is equal before the law\. 





This ‚Äòequality‚Äô policy is up\-rooting the lives of women who attended Danish schools, and have lived in the country since the age of 13, to return them to a place of instability not safety\. This is not ‚Äòequality before the law‚Äô\.
