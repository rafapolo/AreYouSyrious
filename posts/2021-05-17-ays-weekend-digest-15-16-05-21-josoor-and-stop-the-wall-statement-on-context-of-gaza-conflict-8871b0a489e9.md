#### FEATURED: Josoor and Stop the Wall Statement on context of Gaza conflict


■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 
> **[Josoor](https://twitter.com/JosoorNet) @ Twitter Says:** 

> > Prior to the current escalation of violence in #Israel and #Palestine, we have joined a statement by Stop the Wall regarding the use of drones in #EU border militarisation relating to Israel. This statement was always meant to be released today, on #Nakba73  (1/4) https://t.co/n1ukgq9esS

■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 


As concerns continue about the situation in Palestine and Israel, Josoor and Stop the Wall have released a joint statement scheduled for the 73rd anniversary of Nakba looking at the complex history of the current conflict\.


> The recent court ruling and plan to forcibly evict over 2,000 Palestinians from their homes in the neighbourhoods of Sheikh Jarrah and Al\-Bustan is currently being portrayed as the reason for the most significant escalation of violence between Palestinians and Israelis of the past decade\. Given the background to these events, relating to the past eviction of Jewish inhabitants under Jordanian occupation, there is a lot of room for discussion — as with so much in this longstanding, highly complex issue\. But whether this specific court ruling is considered justified or not, it is part of a broader pattern of oppression, violence, and settler colonialism which has been in place since 1948\. 





\{…\}


> The responsibility for this sad fact does not only lie with Israel and Hamas\. The Israeli\- Palestinian history and current state of affairs are both intertwined with British colonisation, European and Arab antisemitism, racism, nationalism, capitalism, regional wars and conflicts, the interests of various global players and much more\. 





Read the full statement [HERE](https://www.josoor.net/post/73-years-of-the-nakba?fbclid=IwAR0Q84zXydsR8RoeLFSN3dYGq4mv6d_3Ku0-oCC_LihDwH52LfNzabjIZCQ) \.

At the same time, protests took place throughout the world in support of the people of Palestine\.

For some, the current violence will force them to leave and risk their lives to seek safety abroad as it has so many times in the past:


■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 
> **[Itamar Mann](https://twitter.com/itamann) @ Twitter Says:** 

> > The attack on Gaza will displace many Palestinians, sending them on horrific journeys seeking asylum. Many will have suffered bombings against the backdrop of extreme poverty and oppression. Governments should grant them intl protection, but also help make their return possible.

Aegean Boat Report state that approximately 27 people arrived on Sunday at Samos\. Another boat landed on Lesvos, numbers unknown\.
#### SEA
#### SEA\-EYE 4 rescues 172 people in two rescues within one day\!


> The two wooden boats were discovered simultaneously by the bridge\. All people were brought aboard SEA\-EYE 4 and medically examined\. Two people had to be stabilized in the infirmary for a longer time\. Among those rescued are many children, an eight\-month young baby and a pregnant woman\. A third rescue is imminent\. The emergency came to the attention of the crew because a Frontex aircraft circled not far from the SEA\-EYE 4, but without directly informing Sea\-Eye about the boat in distress\.

> The procession then climbed onto the main road, blocking it, once again underlining how this road is inaccessible to a few people selected by the states but is crossed every day by hundreds of merchandise trucks\. 





> Aware that the forests are the place where the violence of the border is perpetrated, we took back the paths\.

#### WORTH LISTENING

[Episode 5 in the Civil Fleet Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4dN5VStr7dv0XfCBU9Hy7N?si=Has793-qQCmG9bWxc6gIPQ&nd=1&fbclid=IwAR3DaictLPCVCe9JBWCBS2sq8XACZfcYrwFxT-FN9MLY02UL-cpi66RrhKE) : “IN TODAY’S episode, we speak with Alarm Phone activist Deanna\. She talks to us about the refugee shipwreck in the Mediterranean last month that took the lives of 130 people\. Though the disaster may look like a catastrophic dereliction of duty, Deanna tells us that the authorities behaved exactly as the European border regime wants them to\. Deanna tells us why the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centres in Italy, Malta and Libya should be replaced by civil\-society organisations, and in fact how they already have been\. And we also speak about why Alarm Phone advocates for the removal of all borders and for the abolition of itself\.”
