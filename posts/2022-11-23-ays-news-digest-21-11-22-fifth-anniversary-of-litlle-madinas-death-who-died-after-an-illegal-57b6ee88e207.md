### Five years ago little Madina Hussiny lost her life at the Croatian border after being pushbacked

Systematic pushbacks at European borders endanger the lives of people seeking international protection\. The death of six year old Madina, from Afghanistan, is proof of this, and just one of many\. [Read more here](https://e-erim.ief.hr/pojam/p-madina-hussiny-p?locale=en) about Madina\.

On the anniversary of her death, in 2018, we wrote:


> “Her name was Madina Hussiny\. In the cold November night in 2017, she entered Croatia with her family, asking for asylum\. Following orders they had, Croatian police officers forced the family to follow train tracks back to Serbian territory\. No asylum for you, they’ve probably said, like so many times before\. Madina was hit by a train and died minutes after the push\-back\. Today, State’s Attorney Office of the Republic of Croatia decided no one is responsible for the death of little Madina\. Yesterday, Croatian police officers shot two refugee children, both 12 years old\. It seems that no one will be charged for this misdeed as well\. How many children have to be killed or wounded before someone is held accountable for violence on Croatian borders?”

On 18th November 2021 the European Court of Human Rights \(ECHR\) ruled on the killing of a six\-year old Afghan girl during a pushback from Croatia to Serbia, confirming that Croatia illegally expels people\.

The ECHR issued findings that the Republic of Croatia violated Madina’s right to life, treated children inhumanely by keeping them in detention, illegally deprived the whole family of their liberty, collectively expelled part of the family from Croatia, and ultimately prevented them from accessing their lawyer\. So it was in the context of an illegal pushback that Madina lost her life, with a violation of Article 4 \(prohibition of collective expulsion\) of Protocol N\.4 to the European Convention on Human Rights\. The ECHR ruling of 18 November confirms the use of illegal expulsions already since 2017\. The ECHR also places the violation of Article 4 alongside the violation of Article 2: the right to life\. The right that Croatia denied Madina\. Death is not an unwanted effect of borders\. It is the consequence of their planned dangerousness, the result of specific border management\. The militarisation of borders, which has characterised the Balkan Route since 2015, does not decrease the arrival of asylum seekers, but puts their lives more at risk\. Sophisticated technologies and securitisation policies add to the violence of refoulement\.
