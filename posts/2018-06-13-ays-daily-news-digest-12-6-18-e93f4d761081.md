### FEATURE

Over 1000 people took to the streets of Palermo on Monday night to protest the Italian government’s refusal to allow a SAR ship with 600\+ people onboard to land in Italy\. This action models the action that must be constantly taken by citizens in order to show their disavowal of decisions that not only contravene migration law but first and foremost jeopardize the lives of human beings\.

However, [Italy still faces possible penalties](http://www.ansa.it/english/news/general_news/2018/06/12/italy-risks-penal-responsibilities-3_6c18483b-e664-411e-b38e-cdacb1badbe8.html) for their refusal to allow the ship to dock, which precipitated an absurd crisis and ended with the ship docking in Spain after first being directed to Malta\. Spanish Justice Minister stated: “It’s not a question of being a bleeding\-heart liberal or of generosity, but of humanitarian law\.”

Paradoxically, and perhaps in light of this possible penalization, Italy allowed a ship with more than 900 people to dock later\. Frederico Soda of IOM highlights that technically these decisions cannot be made by the Minister of the Interior \(who ostensibly forbade the ship with 600\+ people\) \.

Regardless of whose responsibility it is, it is telling how flippantly governments will risk contravening international law in order to serve their interests whilst invoking it at will in order to persecute and crack down on people in need as well as those helping them\.

It is expected that probably the people themselves will be treated poorly in detention, criminalized simply for wishing to not suffer\.
### EU

Belgian representative Guy Verhofstadt had strong words to criticize the failure of the European Union to share responsibility and support people seeking safety and a better life\. Watch below:


[![Guy Verhofstadt](https://scontent.flis6-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/31016914_10156823645920016_6347169757417963520_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=776239&_nc_ohc=YEXaeeCjiBIAX9uRe0J&_nc_ht=scontent.flis6-1.fna&oh=00_AfBZxXVWnCckQU4wdIGmk79LCcK-f-L9Q_PF58uj1T4h3Q&oe=639BD4D0 "Guy Verhofstadt")](https://www.facebook.com/GuyVerhofstadt/videos/vb.99985820015/10156823595985016/?type=2)


Conversely, Sebastian Kurz of Austria is forming a plan to have a refugee reception centers where people wishing to come can ask for asylum\. Sounds like a change coming from the conservative and strongly anti\-migrant politician until the full plan is revealed — the centers will be outside the EU\. Furthermore it is designed to “provide protection rather than a chance at a better life\.” When asked, he noted that he is working with a “very small group of other countries very confidentially” in order to bring the plan to fruition\. Radio Free Europe also reports that Austrian media speculates that Albania may be the location of this planned project, but when asked it was said, “We’ll see\.” For more information \(Available in BCS\) as well as IOM’s numbers of people on the move in Albania, Bosnia, and Montenegro, go [here](https://www.slobodnaevropa.org/a/29288174.html) \.
### GREECE

Two boats landed on Samos east this morning between 06\.00–07\.00\.
First boat 23 people, second boat 19 people, [Aegean Boat Report](https://www.facebook.com/AegeanBoatReport/?hc_ref=ARTpJAUAjqy7fKrpvGl8aLx2puCO9lEJIvG0mULGpsHGQnCJwSolf2teuO7lIPpunJQ&fref=nf) team reports\.

The UNHCR has published a document that provides detailed information on Temporary Accommodation Sites and Reception & Identification Centers \(RICs\) in Greece in order to allow for better planning and to address gaps where highlighted\. You can find it [here](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/documents/download/63930) \.
### Moria, Lesvos

After it had managed to ease down to 6,872 late last week, the camp is close to reaching the maximum of 7,500 people capacity after this week’s arrivals\. Responding to these and other similar concerns, sources at the Migration Ministry have suggested that the camp should expect some relief over the next few weeks, as 2,000 to 3,000 asylum seekers will be transferred from Lesvos to facilities on the Greek mainland, the media [report\.](http://www.ekathimerini.com/229521/article/ekathimerini/news/moria-close-to-7500-mark-as-ministry-vows-transfers) The local volunteers on Lesvos report that, apart from the constant issue with scabies, many children staying in Moria are struggling with a number of insect bites\.
### Vial Chios

Vial is full\.The people there live even under the trees \. There is an information that the newly arrived people are not allowed to have tents, so camp does not seem full to the public\.

### Diavata


> Unfortunately tensions in this camp are heightened and there has been increased conflict between the different communities inside\. Only a few weeks ago the Yazidi people were thrown out of Diavata camp and there has been some fighting with the Kurdish community\. Once we were half way through our distribution there was a fight and we decided to stop and leave as I felt it was no longer safe for that day\. No one was hurt, [_Refugee Biriyani & Bananas_](https://www.facebook.com/RefugeeBiriyaniAndBananas/?hc_ref=ART2Rgmd1u_yf8viHZE8oYnwHiz9OF7BJZRM9kJb-RXT1CrLvJSq2xnpAJAY5X7xzkk) _team reports\._

### BOSNIA

Volunteers in Sarajevo report that police are now using racial and economic profiling to randomly force people off of green areas\. Visibly wealthy tourists are left alone, but in areas where refugees often gather, police occasionally show up and state that they are dirtying the area and are upsetting the public order, citing regulations against groups gathering in public without a permit\. People will return later, but this kind of familiar game can only escalate and push people into more dangerous locations\.
### FRANCE


> Last night, a displaced person was hit by a car and killed on the motorway in Calais\. This morning, the French state has made over 200 people shelter\-less\. Tents, tarpaulin and bedding were stolen from 3 living places across Calais, with no documentation to justify these operations shown to witnesses present at these evictions\. At least 6 people were arrested, with no justification given\. 





> Here, the Prefecture is seen ignoring the request of a volunteer asking to see the requisition for one of these forced evictions\.
 

> The deputy commissaire, RIO number 1144880, was present however ignored volunteers requests as to why arrests were being made at one of the evictions\.
 

> With no adequate solutions provided to accommodate the people further displaced by these evictions, the French state is consciously and deliberately destabilising people who, by law, they are obligated to help\. — [Refugee Info Bus](https://www.facebook.com/RefugeeInfoBus/?hc_ref=ARSmrqKtO2NKtXVWvwhivMMdcgEPqoFWPG_IUMK-_gaQ8A8DPDqRLyAmiwJadlFmADQ&fref=nf&hc_location=group)
