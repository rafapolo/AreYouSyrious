#### FEATURED

Very difficult conditions for over 700 people who live in Sombor have been reported by the field teams of Asylum Protection Centre in Serbia\.
Only 200 people at the camp possess camp cards, most of the people there have no access to medical services, food and water\. 
Reportedly, there is no hot water in the camp, nor are health condition and COVID\-19 status checked for the people inside\. According to reports, one doctor is available daily for one hour\. Given the number of people at the camp and the dire need for medical assistance, it is safe to say that for most people — there is no access to health care\.
Around 150 people are staying in tents next to the camp, mostly boys aged 10 and 12, from Syria\.

For all the limitations on movement due to the coronavirus, Serbia saw only 1000 fewer people in 2020 than they’d seen in 2019\. However, it should be noted that these are only the numbers traced\. Generalisation when it comes to public rhetoric is more present than ever\. An upcoming report documents the responsibility of the media, having so far provided the extreme groups too much space and the ability to spread hate propaganda, state legal experts active in the field of asylum\. 
In the coming days, we will be writing more extensively on the state of things in Serbia\.

Nothing much has changed at the Moria2\.0, Kara Tepe camp\. The number of factors posing a risk for people’s lives is growing and people’s misery is now being photographed, described, written about, and most of all, observed, but there are no concrete actions or will to change it\.

“In a large tent of singles, rain fell on the electric wire and it ignited and broke down and now they have no electricity and it is not clear when the authorities will come to repair the electricity,” one of the people trapped inside the camp writes on his Twitter account\.

#### BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA

Another in the line of many puzzling “conclusions” after the most recent meeting of the main stakeholders in charge of the asylum and reception system in the country, and currently in the hold of several thousand people’s lives, comes from the Minister of Internal Affairs, saying:


> Next week, together with the Minister of Security of BiH and the Mayor of Ilidža, I will visit the migrant camp in Blažuj and determine the necessary measures to improve security\. We have initiated a clearer definition of ‘house rules’ within migrant camps, the increased role of police officers and procurement of necessary material and technical equipment for the police\. 





In Bosnia and Herzegovina around 3000 people live outside of the reception centers, in old houses or in the “jungle”\. Life as a homeless person on the move is so hard, yet it’s something that deeply touches our hearts to see their strength, their extraordinary resilience, reminds the Ipsia team\.


> Not even the shameful conditions where they’re living can take away their dignity\. And this is stunning\. 




#### HUNGARY
### Frontex suspending operations in Hungary

This move of the organisation [accused of complicity](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.infomigrants.net%2Fen%2Fpost%2F29624%2Ffrontex-accused-of-complicity-in-hungarian-pushbacks-declared-illegal-by-eu%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR3stHUeQINGq4DKkAuQuSR3f7PXWqy-82Y3m9e4Sc0dZJB23X4wHjsOwPU&h=AT0IzZgH8zvNeYEHK5ctxLIVHsJRx6E836G6mrAl_iMbPPPj5Di6YwPLhYl-HW1TaXLBu38JBJfiSVAAVKiN_YyxqCHOqhVAFGXY7m0pk7Z78T_4jB2Yb1ZIB-smcmi1u6Yt-1EGxTK3hA&__tn__=R]-R&c[0]=AT0bMTemOdnv8qH_M4N7P2F-BMgBKn6-U_akRiP85alYq24kh-45H6vqSqtnOiDowM96SCvqa2x30CMmcGR70F5pbv-yIuxrBx3wGFqtYq4CPAjpvR1qszO1Ekk3cP96EHzN3DcwDSdoTLWJkNpQzR858fv7HGrORv1nrOZiTnQQ56TpKzalW064KQZEE9PSVuvymS_zzYjO1flJbw) many times comes after Hungary has continued to push back people into Serbia — in violation of a European Court of Justice ruling in December\.
Not to forget, [Frontex ended 2020 amid a storm of criticism](https://www.statewatch.org/news/2021/january/eu-frontex-unrepentant-about-chasing-transparency-activists-for-court-costs/?fbclid=IwAR2lp-A9Ot6fmZmVrl-1bu494JPIQAtYfrpz6Rc5PBFBdPGJtnVauBx4czw) from European Parliament, the European Commission and civil society observers over alleged knowledge of, or potential involvement in, pushbacks of migrants from Greece to Turkey\.

At the same time, as of today, Frontex is ending a complementary “Joint Operation” at maritime borders in Montenegro\. During their time in the area, “Frontex Surveillance Aircraft were providing aerial surveillance in the operational area\. At the same time, one Italian helicopter, operating from Italy, was performing aerial surveillance for Montenegro as well,” according to the official response to a question on their activities\. Responding to the question about the exact area where they were active, Leggeri responded that it was “carried out over the Adriatic Sea, focusing on the territorial waters of Montenegro up to the limits of the Exclusive Economic Zone of Montenegro, with a **specific focus on the maritime border with Croatia** \. In order to implement the activity in Montenegro, a Focal Point has been activated on the premises of the National Coordination Centre \(NCC\) in Podgorica, which hosts the deployed members of the teams\. At a request by the Montenegrin authorities and approval from Frontex, the members of the teams may perform activities in line with the operational aim, in other locations, such as the Regional Border Police Unit/ Border Crossing Point Bar”\.
#### ITALY
### You failed to protect the right to life, court says

Italy failed to protect the right to life of more than 200 people who were on board a vessel that sank in the Mediterranean Sea in 2013, the UN [Human Rights Committee](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ohchr.org%2Fen%2Fhrbodies%2Fccpr%2Fpages%2Fccprindex.aspx%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0UTjbnkj0NfH6x0XF17gjiw0qzRICWzukmNPDV1g5n2H-CSeP6DkfJKus&h=AT1NkE1mfXzoZa_VLDWTJ6I4ZEuZ7Ci90slxXuz3qH-xBAa2r6kVlgqSiPElXZDd8yQVmM2GG6UdOV6Blncgwvya_XZzeWBu5S4wAjvWMdgwczq-gpmU7uHuQLs0aKddmA&__tn__=-UK-R&c[0]=AT34iSNJjTZE3Nxik7GoiLvgFQ4Fc_nsV_LGSvsmV1-Qa2_u9gA1M0_fWPrnnZcdufCcTDA0HU6VlnElX5c3Om_RCVUDIAtq35_LmSmT_9kzu0E3Afjo7oPYjYxRrGvUPiEF-kQTidp02UxRa5E4Fk49nrEB1zwKEJs13Yfg1Nkcm9zvxOviTF-i6zQs6JqdGtxIbIWdaHZfb6TkRA) has found\.

In a decision published today, the Human Rights Committee said that Italy had failed to respond promptly to various distress calls from the sinking boat, which was carrying more than 400 adults and children\. The State party also failed to explain the delay in dispatching its navy ship, ITS Libra, which was located only about an hour away from the scene\.


> “Had the Italian authorities immediately directed their naval ship and coastguard boats after the distress calls, the rescue would have reached the vessel in the last two hours before it sank,” said Committee member Tigroudja\. 




### Demanding investigation into the use of public funds in detention centres in Libya

ASGI s [ubmitted a complaint](https://sciabacaoruka.asgi.it/en/asgi-asks-the-italian-court-of-auditors-for-an-investigation-into-the-use-of-public-funds-in-detention-centres-in-libya/?fbclid=IwAR3_juuph-KDfT7HQZ_X3UL5neB4pHfXBEjrEz-1aeHK9prhu2BdT3aUMB4#smooth-scroll-top) to the Public Prosecutor’s Office at the Court of Auditors in Rome, pointing out several critical issues concerning the activities carried out by some Italian NGOs in Libya with funds from the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation \(AICS\) \.

The complaint is based on the report [“A Critical Analysis of Government\-funded Projects by Italian NGOs in Libyan Detention Centres”](https://sciabacaoruka.asgi.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ENG-Legal-analysis-of-Italian-NGO-projects-in-Libyan-detention-centers.pdf) , published on 15 July 2020, in which ASGI analyses a series of documents obtained from FOI requests to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and AICS\.
#### FRANCE
### People have the power

This weekend, in 13 cities in France, several hundred volunteers mobilized during the annual big collection by Utopia 54 with the aim of collecting donations for people on the move\.

This made it possible for them to distribute hygiene products during their 2600 yearly distributions as well as fill the dry food closets at the five juvenile reception facilities they run\.


> Our association works mainly through citizen mobilization, without such material or financial donations, we would not be able to fulfill this mission we gave ourselves, to provide emergency aid to exiled people\. 





Mililtary camps providing the “international minimum” are not examples of good practice, this is\. Collective effort put into action and direct solidarity\. 
Make it happen whenever and wherever you can\!

Violence in the Sahel region in Africa is likely to drive more refugees towards the Mediterranean and along dangerous escape routes to Europe — the UN Refugee Agency \(UNHCR\) [warns](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bluewin.ch%2Fde%2Fnews%2Finternational%2Funhcr-rechnet-mit-mehr-fluechtlingen-aus-afrika-richtung-mittelmeer-557260.html%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2AKalSyLd8R71mGCKWGx9R71LA3NhyMFmYyIeO8mmzPNinglq_643HDXM&h=AT0OVYsv4oYtY0I40YUVp98zyWo6idTFO0znvURZqg3DWwOF10EruPfaaaKopjsmCkhcYhbiOMc4DbMKs4hU2FEQ1Pg4PfRNVaNrhwcrJR3AsSV8cjeevzPUeWwjFV6Hsq3eCUt-k5suOg&__tn__=R]-R&c[0]=AT2xBL5h3Knr5ChK3_25vUuU3aNr4zkIK6Bhp22_kpZHkOuV5zGO30tFRcMCmTNha9XmlDO7zR62kbcj489x69_ORGlOcMlBknMRJUxZl7NmgxiI5H69y6P07gUBUZ7yTCw8-fb9YjOKB96tt_myZzFnybv37rgIjJcq6FcxOljHNz5dRK2g5FsF7v9ptYfsQPTPDKCfRuenNHvwDA) of this\.

2\.9 million people would have to flee\. “If there is no prospect of peace and stability in the region, further displacement is highly likely,” the UNHCR reported on Wednesday\. The situation is also desolate in the neighboring countries of refuge, also as a result of the coronavirus crisis\. “This is why many people keep trying to make the risky sea voyage to Europe\.”
