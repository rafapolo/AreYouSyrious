### FEATURE

[On Thursday](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/09/failure-to-quash-terror-charges-against-syrian-man-a-devastating-blow-for-justice-in-hungary/) , Ahmed H\. was convicted of “complicity in act of terror” by the Hungarian Court of Appeal\. He is found guilty of acting during clashes with the police on the Serbian\-Hungarian border during September 2015\. Human rights organizations and others are furious since the decision seems to be politically motivated against refugees and given that he has already spent three years behind bars\.


> “By blatantly misusing terrorism\-related provisions and riding roughshod over the law, this verdict exemplifies the erosion of the rule of law and human rights protections in Hungary\.” 





> \- Eda Seyhan, Amnesty International 





[He was sentenced to five years](https://twitter.com/demeteraaron/status/1042730569396838400) , facing a maximum of two more years in prison, and a minimum of four months' more of detention\. Still, he doesn’t speak Hungarian, his wife and daughter are having to live without him, and he has been convicted of a crime he didn’t commit\.

The horrors in Hungary for refugees continue\.
### MOROCCO

[They have started](https://twitter.com/Tere_Palomo/status/1042846955255341057) to deport people in Morocco back to their countries of origin\.

[Association Marocaine des Droits Humains\- Section Nador](https://www.facebook.com/AmdhNador/posts/2188629074682689) followed the operations of the Moroccan authorities, the embassies of African countries, and IOM and noted the deportation of at least 50 some people who were illegally arrested over the past three days\.

### LIBYA

[Heavy fighting](https://twitter.com/Lyobserver/status/1042811622622941184) continued Thursday morning in the south of Tripoli\. Rockets fell on many civilian areas\.

[A ceasefire meeting](https://www.libyaobserver.ly/news/unsmil-holds-meeting-ceasefire-committee-diplomats-violence-rocks-tripoli%C2%A0) was held by the UNSMIL and between the Head of Ceasefire Monitoring Committee Hussein Abdullah and the Libyan diplomatic community, but the ceasefire was obviously broken\.

As for the conflict affecting displaced persons and refugees:


> [\(IOM\)](https://www.libyaobserver.ly/inbrief/iom-19225-people-displaced-start-conflict-tripoli) revealed that the number of displaced since the outset of Tripoli’s clashes on August 26 is estimated at 3,845 families\. 





Troops were also lined up at detention centers, ready for any clashes that might break out due to the outside fighting\. Libya continues to be an active violent zone and cannot be considered a safe country for refugees\.

A new study has found that the liquidity crisis in Libya is affecting refugees in that they have to work more, but are earning less\. The economic crisis started in 2014 after returned internal conflict arose since the Arab Spring and the topple of Ghaddafi and to led to where the Libyan dinar has significantly lost value\. Most refugees are getting paid in cash, which means they are at a very high risk of robbery and kidnapping\. Locals feeling the hardship on of the crisis are essentially preying on refugee workers\. A long term economic solution must be put in place to ensure the vitality of the country\.

### SEA

[The Aquarius](https://twitter.com/msf_sea/status/1042696721086771200?s=21) rescued a small distressed boat in international waters on Thursday morning with 11 people\. They were told to bring them back to Libya but refused\. The Libyans are now refusing to take them since receiving no for an answer\. The Aquarius is waiting for Italy or Malta to provide them a port of [safety\.](https://onboard-aquarius.org/)

[Salvamento Maritimo](https://twitter.com/salvamentogob/status/1042854086784241664) said they were able to rescue 10 boats in the strait, Alboran, Cartagena and Baleares with a total of 337 people on Thursday\.
### GREECE
#### Islands

[Amnesty International Greece](https://www.amnesty.gr/news/press/article/21553/se-mayri-trypa-ton-anthropinon-dikaiomaton-metatrepontai-ta-nisia-toy) writes in a press release on Wednesday:


> “The Greek authorities must immediately take refugees to the mainland and end the inhumane containment policy that has trapped nearly 20,500 people in unacceptable and overcrowded conditions on the Aegean Islands\. The conditions in the refugee camps have reached an uninhibited\.” 





While certain efforts have been made recently to move more people to the mainland, the fact that the system is to begin with inhumane can no longer be ignored\.

A detailed update report of Lesvos came from Heimatstern [e\.V](https://www.facebook.com/heimatstern/posts/2251974728372975?__xts__[0]=68.ARD-dauEkl2iEz6UiOkJrt8Gf83tWnTo6fv1wsVhFzEyj8ulD5kt1Ldcw9s_Tfk6SMCdOdiuvdxt80ppoMfWU68p5-FLCOGvoSvwOOydebQCsph3QOlX7FvXN2zyIeSlozuKzCirdTCpF7FAPDNm2RWBWsHprooIpjI37rX5rgplFz5L-MsN&__tn__=H-R) \. One of the most disheartening aspects came from the medical perspective:


> “People who get physically healthy to camp Moria get sick here\. There are not enough doctors, not even for a diagnosis to refer sick to a clinic\. To clinics that are on the island all beyond their capacity, in chronic\-Greece\. The Keelpno \(Ministry of health\) has 2 doctors in Moria\. One was in our visit to vacation, the other for family problems not present\. 96 percent all refugee women on Lesbos have become at least rape, in their home or on the run, according to a voluntary victim\. Many of the unaccompanied women are pregnant\. Or get pregnant in Moria\. Doctors without borders have documented cases of 10\-Year\-old children who wanted to kill themselves in Moria\.”

[300 people](https://www.facebook.com/samosvolunteers/photos/a.567427800102051/1083511911826968/?type=3&theater) were finally able to leave the horrors of the camp on Samos for the mainland this week\. Samos Volunteers stated that some had been living on the island for 2 1/2 years\. While they are certainly happy for the ones leaving, they warn:


> “However, almost 3,000 other men, women and children are still stuck in a camp where the living conditions leave little space for hope and happiness\. Winter is coming, and the waiting continues\.”

### AUSTRIA

[Sea Watch member,](https://www.facebook.com/watchthemed.alarmphone/posts/2222762054664692?hc_location=ufi) Tamino, was arrested yesterday before being able to give a speech at the NoS20 in Salzburg\.

Single men and families are in equal numbers living on the streets, with many accompanied minors as well\. Some on the streets are victims of Dublin returns while others are new arrivals\. There are five centers processing new arrivals: three for single men and two for families\. Volunteers are continuing to do everything in their power, but without a government solution homelessness will continue\.
