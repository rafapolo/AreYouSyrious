#### FEATURE — Over 100 people on Hunger Strike in French Detention Centres

Numbers of hunger strikers in the detention centres of Vincennes and Mesnil\-Amelot in the Paris region range from [100](https://www.franceinter.fr/justice/des-migrants-en-greve-de-la-faim?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Facebook&fbclid=IwAR3uMD_R1fOZVB1QogNa0TJIgXeusJtWlYx7n2oZwVMhTX0i2PPRuzTtnoM#Echobox=1547189082) to [150](https://www.facebook.com/LIdentiteNationale/posts/2010304105725453?hc_location=ufi) \. They are on hunger strike against their living conditions, arrests and detention\. Some people at Vincennes have already been striking for over a week, according [to local media](https://www.franceinter.fr/justice/des-migrants-en-greve-de-la-faim?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Facebook&fbclid=IwAR3uMD_R1fOZVB1QogNa0TJIgXeusJtWlYx7n2oZwVMhTX0i2PPRuzTtnoM#Echobox=1547189082) \. The hunger strikers’ situation has been aggravated by a new law which came into force on the 1st of January, which doubled the maximum length of detention from 45 days to 90 days\.

In the last year, the number of migrants being held in the detention centres where the [Cimade association](https://www.lacimade.org/) intervenes has risen from 20% to 40%\.

[Locals also update](https://www.facebook.com/collectifnationrefuge/posts/559842357824941?comment_id=559856441156866&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R1%22%7D&hc_location=ufi) from hunger strikers in the Rouen\-Oissel Centre de Rétention Administrative:


> they got gassed and beaten up this afternoon because they refused to eat, take their treatments, clean up… two are in isolation…\. but they are determined\! 





More deeply disturbing reports are coming from other [local activists](https://www.facebook.com/groups/calaismigrantssolidarity/permalink/10156046473559562/?hc_location=ufi) working in the area stating that people are enduring various forms of serious abuse in Rouen\-Oissel\.


> He’s a detention centre where a policeman likes to put his index finger in the anus of the selected foreigners\. 





> It is a detention centre where, in the isolation cell \(solitary\) of the police officers handcuffed a person’s wrists to the bars of a chair, put a foam helmet on him, shot in that chair and left this man So on earth 6 hours while passing regularly guffaw before him to provoke him\. 





> It is a detention centre where tonight, after testifying anonymously to the radio by telephone, a prisoner was threatened by the director who accused him \(wrongly\) of being the leader of the hunger strike that Started last night following other serious violence suffered by another detained and collective bullying\. 





They call for all journalists, politicians, elected officials and activists to call the director to let him know that he must immediately stop letting his staff abuse the residents of this facility\.

**We stand in solidarity with the Hunger Strikers\.**

**End arbitrary detention\!**

**Freedom of movement and the right to work for all\!**

SYRIA
#### 26,577 barrel bombs dropped over Syria since 2015

The Syrian Network for Human Rights has published a [new report](http://sn4hr.org/blog/2019/01/07/53023/?fbclid=IwAR1lTAxxyPQadv-Jt_rLTGR-33W0BR1cLVBY0bfN5CGsWMgFTEL4S6oweVI) documenting the use of barrel bombs by the Syrian regime forces — 26,577 barrel bombs have been deployed since the start of the Russian intervention on September 30th, 2015, even though Vitaly Churkin, the former Russian representative to the United Nations, promised in October 2015 that barrel bombs would no longer be used by Assad’s forces\. These bombs have been filled with poisonous gas and anti\-tank mines\.

[Sally Hayden reports](https://twitter.com/sallyhayd/status/1083692711415300096?fbclid=IwAR2cw5TXqrhSpTYMYdqtAmAJHsuMAbLjE36pyTJ5OPZyt-u0zIpUDYOwc28) from those stuck in detention in Libya\. Originally it was thought that only 30 people had been forcibly taken from detention in Khoms this week but now it could be up to 70, all unregistered by the UN\. Multiple sources confirm that these people have been taken to Bani Walid:
