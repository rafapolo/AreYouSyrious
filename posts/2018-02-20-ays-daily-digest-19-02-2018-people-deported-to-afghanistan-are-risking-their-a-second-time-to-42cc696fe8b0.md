### Feature: New evidence finds that a large number of people who have been deported to Afghanistan are forced to flee a second time

[In a report by Pro\.Asy](https://www.proasyl.de/en/news/escape-again-afghan-refugees-deported-from-germany-are-forced-to-flee-a-second-time/) l, it is revealed that many of those forcibly returned to Afghanistan from Germany are desperately trying to reach Europe again in a secondary bid to seek protection\. Many are now stuck in deplorable conditions on the Greek Islands\. This only highlights the sheer danger people face upon their deportations to Afghanistan and their desperation to find safety\.

The report reads:


> The Pro\.Asyl staff interviewed four Afghan refugees who managed to find a way back to Europe, and in the process risked their lives for a second time\. They described their horrible experiences of deportation from Germany, the second escape from Afghanistan and the degrading living conditions they now face while trapped in Greece as a result of the EU\-Turkey migration deal\. None of them had a criminal record in Germany\. All were well integrated 





Germany recommenced deportations to Kabul in December 2016 under the ‘joint way framework’ — an agreement between EU and Afghanistan for the forcible return of Afghan protection seekers from Europe\.


> So far, 174 persons have been deported \[from Germany\] despite a recent spate of deadly attacks in the conflict ravaged country\. 




Pro\.Asyl interviewed people who after deportations were now stuck in Greece\. The reports describe the danger they faced upon their return to Afghanistan\. Being forced to flee again\. The traumatic experience of the apprehension and deportation from Germany\. Risking their lives in Turkey and the devastating conditions they find themselves in now on the Greek Islands\.


> “I was independent from the help of the German state\. I had a stable income\. I don’t understand why I was sent back\.” 





> Hassan Jan\*, a 29 year\-old Afghan refugee describing his life before deportation 




#### The next expulsion to Afghanistan will allegedly take place on Tuesday the 20\.2\.2018 From Munich\.

#### New data states that 2017 was the deadliest year on record of civilian casualties in Afghanistan

[A report by the Guardian](https://amp.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/19/uk-under-pressure-over-afghan-asylum-seekers-as-civilian-deaths-rise?CMP=share_btn_fb&__twitter_impression=true) states that the UK government is under pressure to stop deporting people back to Afghanistan amidst data that shows civilian casualties in 2017 reached over 10,000 for the fourth year in a row\.

**The home office of the UK recognises Afghanistan as the world’s least peaceful country after Syria** \. Despite this, 785 people were returned in 2016 from the UK to Afghanistan despite it being the deadliest year recorded of civilian casualties\. Furthermore between the years 2007 and 2015, over 2,000 unaccompanied children who sought asylum from Afghanistan have been deported back according to a report that was released by [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/european-governments-return-nearly-10000-afghans-risk-death-and-torture-new-report) \.

Afghanistan is not safe\. It is time to end this nonsense\.
### Sea:

#### ECRE is concerned with reform of the Dublin System

ECRE is calling on all EU member states to ensure fundamental rights protection in the reform of the Dublin system\.

#### UN Migration Agency records that over 1200 Children who were seeking safety in Europe have died since 2014

Since the picture of Alan Kurdi made headlines around the world, many more children have died during migration\. Despite over 1200 reported deaths, Julia Black, the coordinator of the Missing Migrants Project concludes:


> “We know that our data are incomplete\. The truth is that the number of children who die during migration is much higher than what we know\. Obtaining better data could help to reduce such tragedies in the future, as well as help families to identify their loved ones\.” 




Nearly half of recorded deaths occurred while attempting to cross the Mediterranean\.

### Greece:
#### Arrivals:

New arrivals documented by [Aegean Boat Report](https://www.facebook.com/AegeanBoatReport/posts/308962942960150) \.

One boat was picked up outside Lesvos south, Kratigou at 00\.30am by Frontex\. 58 people on board, no breakdown so far\.

One boat landed on Korakas, Lesvos north at 05\.25am\. 25 people were on board \(4 children, 10 women, 11 men\)

One boat picked up outside of Samos early this morning, it was taken to port Samos\. 25 people were on board \(9 children, 4 women, 12 men\)

One boat is reported to be on its way towards Rhodes, 15 people are on board \(8 adults and 7 children\) \. Landing has not been confirmed\.
Update:


> Latest info is that this boat most likely did not make it to Rhodes\. Last known position was 45 km from Rhodes, at 23\.30, inside Turkey waters\. TCG was informed about this boat, and was looking for it, unknown if they found it\. — Aegean Boat Report 





One boat was stopped on its way towards Samos by the Turkish Coastguard\. TCG was perusing this boat for some time, maneuvering dangerously close to the rubber dingy in high speed\. TCG was dragging a long metal chain to try to rip off the engine on the rubber boat, extremely dangerous\. \.

A boat with 17 Turkish citizens \(7 men, 5 women, 5 children\) landed on the small island of Oinouses, off of Chios today\.
#### Update from Dirty Girls Lesvos

Dirty Girls have washed nearly one ton of blankets that would otherwise have been sent to landfill\. So far during their time working they have saved 600 tons of material that otherwise the government and International NGOs would have discarded\.

#### EU commission will extend funding of apartments in Greece for Refugees until end of 2019

[Reveals head of UNHCR Greece](https://www.facebook.com/groups/PAMPIRAIKI/permalink/596351500708958/?hc_location=ufi) Phillippe Leclerk in an interview with Reuters\. The plan for transfer of responsibilities to local government for apartment management will therefore for the moment be postponed to 2020\. It remains unclear what role UNHCR will play after 2019 — but the plan involves UNHCR to have a more ‘supervisory role’ according to Leclerck\.

After 2019


> According to UNHCR weekly data, the ESTIA program currently includes 23,374 accommodation places in apartments, buildings and hotels across Greece, hosting 19,331 refugees and asylum seekers\. The program involves seven NGOs as well as the municipalities of Athens and Thessaloniki with neighbouring municipalities\.

### Hungary:

On 13 February 2018, the Hungarian government proposed 3 new laws referred to as ‘Stop Soros’ which would put further restrictions on Hungarian civil societies ability to carry out their work, especially those working with refugees\.

The new laws require organisations that ‘support migration’ to go through procedures in order to obtain an national security clearance and a government permit in order to perform basic work\. It would also require these organisations to pay a tax of 25% of any foreign funding that is aimed at helping those seeking asylum\.


> Failure to do so, would subject them to steps so serious that they could lead to exorbitant fines, bankruptcy, and the dissolving of the NGO involved\. 





They may even face risk such as attacks and jail\.


> As defenders of rights and freedoms, we want people everywhere to be able to speak out without being attacked, threatened or jailed\.

#### The occupation of a university Paris 8 building continues

You can’t evict a movement\! The university Paris 8/Saint Denis has been occupied now for three weeks by students and people sleeping rough\. They are joining forces to protest for the right of people seeking asylum to stay in France and for an end to be put to Dublin regulations\.


> This year, Paris is seeing one of its coldest winters in decades\. The masses of snow have caused traffic and public transport chaos and have left thousands of people sleeping rough — many of them migrants — in life\-endangering conditions\. At the same time, the Macron administration is planning a further neoliberalization of France’s universities and keeps tightening French asylum laws and is criminalizing supporters\. Recently, in Nantes, Grenoble, and Lyon, refugees, students, and people in solidarity have started occupying university buildings converging these struggles\. 





Their demands are:
- **documents for everyone**
- **decent, permanent housing**
- **to be allowed to learn French and continue our studies**
- **an end to the non\-recognition of unaccompanied minors \(DEMIE\)**
- **an immediate halt to deportations to all countries, European and abroad**
