#### FEATURE — “I went to save lives and I could see myself twenty years behind bars”

A Spanish firefighter Miguel Roldan participated in a solidarity mission in the Mediterranean in 2017\. Now, Italy is accusing him of the crime of human trafficking\. He faces legal proceedings in Italy on charges that could warrant him up to twenty years in prison for saving migrants on the IUVENTA ship of the German NGO Jugend Rettet, which we’ve previously reported about many times\.

“For the mere fact of removing a person from the water and taking them to a ship they have accused us,” Roldán said to the [Spanish media](https://www.diariodesevilla.es/sevilla/bombero-Sevilla-carcel-rescate-inmigrantes_0_1332167006.html) \. “Everything is kept under wraps and we do not know what we have done wrong, but to come out with this a year later seems strange\.”

He was a part of the previously registered group of volunteers whose mission was to save those in danger from the waters — and he did so during his vacation, reportedly feeling proud “because they rescued many people\.” Dangerous situations occurred regularly, for the people being rescued but also for Miguel and his colleagues\. While Miguel continues to work as a firefighter, he awaits for the mysterious Italian court action to show its real face and to see how the justice system and society sees humanitarian workers, volunteers extending humanity to other humans\.

The kind of people that used to get streets named after them are branded criminals in today’s Europe\.
#### NIGER

African countries are taking on the lion’s share of the refugee crisis on behalf of Europe, welcoming returned Libyan asylum seekers \(people previously staying in Libyan detention centres\) who have been waiting for their asylum requests to be answered by the EU for more than a year now\.


> “We left our country to find peace and freedom, but we never get durable solution by the UN Refugees agency\. Why EU resettlement promises are not respected?” 




They protested against this situation and ongoing practice and, reportedly, when they tried to reach the American and French embassies to deliver their call, tear gas was used against the protesters\.

#### MOROCCO

The number of departures from Morocco has increased five\-fold\. Most of the migrants taking this route last year came from sub\-Saharan countries, but the number of Moroccan nationals attempting to reach Europe also increased significantly\.
### Who gave the order to harass unaccompanied minors?

[Association Marocaine des Droits Humains — Section Nador](https://www.facebook.com/AmdhNador/?__tn__=%2CdkCH-R-R&eid=ARDX9CydrJSePMwTTh0MOHox37wbc1INtfbdY2vyigC2FjDomtPeCraAssbwMsb2mWw_sGqi6L3RPg9K&hc_ref=ARRKrz2Epl8irI2NjOdxaywv8OpYks6iiZ7CAw8oICSjmDzChPWUAXXpu0yYQGJ4OIY&fref=nf&hc_location=group) reports that it’s been a week that the authorities of Nador \(Police, auxiliary forces and authorities\) have been chasing and stopping dozens of Moroccan unaccompanied minors in Nador and Beni Ensar\.

“They stop them, not to offer them the protection, aid and necessary assistance, but simply to insult them and ‘push \(them\) back’ to Casablanca, even if their families do not reside in the city\.”

When [Association Marocaine des Droits Humains](https://www.facebook.com/AmdhNador/?__tn__=%2CdkCH-R-R&eid=ARDX9CydrJSePMwTTh0MOHox37wbc1INtfbdY2vyigC2FjDomtPeCraAssbwMsb2mWw_sGqi6L3RPg9K&hc_ref=ARRKrz2Epl8irI2NjOdxaywv8OpYks6iiZ7CAw8oICSjmDzChPWUAXXpu0yYQGJ4OIY&fref=nf&hc_location=group) protested in front of a police commissioner who was stopping minors by saying he had no right to stop and repress Moroccan minors who are in a Moroccan city, he reportedly responded: “Those are the instructions\.”

About 58 Sub Saharan migrants, among them women and children, were arrested at the beach of Temsamane \(60 km west of Nador\) this Monday, [Association Marocaine des Droits Humains](https://www.facebook.com/AmdhNador/?__tn__=%2CdkCH-R-R&eid=ARDX9CydrJSePMwTTh0MOHox37wbc1INtfbdY2vyigC2FjDomtPeCraAssbwMsb2mWw_sGqi6L3RPg9K&hc_ref=ARRKrz2Epl8irI2NjOdxaywv8OpYks6iiZ7CAw8oICSjmDzChPWUAXXpu0yYQGJ4OIY&fref=nf&hc_location=group) reports\. 
A pregnant woman from the group, who is very close to giving birth, was transported to the hospital of Driouch\.
#### SEA


> Today, we remember the 414 migrants who lost their lives crossing borders in the first two months of 2019\. These numbers are certainly underestimates, failing to account for the loss of life of hundreds of people\.

[Missing Migrants Project](https://www.facebook.com/MissingMigrants/?tn-str=k%2AF&hc_location=group_dialog)

Deaths on the three main Mediterranean Sea routes through almost seven weeks of the new year have reached 223 individuals — or about half the 437 deaths that occurred during the same period in 2018, IOM reports\.


![](assets/587e177edbcf/1*-lQ5UYLxYVlZlWSof13dbQ.jpeg)


The Frontex report _Risk Analysis for 2019_ presents various indicators related to the EU’s external borders and migration in 2018\. These include:
- 190 930 refusals of entry \(up 4%\)
- 148 121 effective returns by member states \(down 5%\)
- 13 728 returns coordinated or organised by Frontex \(down 3%\)
- 10 642 detections of people smugglers/facilitators \(up 4%\)


In the midst of a political climate that increasingly aims to manufacture panic and compel EU citizens to close themselves off against a nonexistent surge of migrants reaching their shores, even Frontex reports that “in 2018, the number of detections of illegal border crossings reached its lowest level in five years\.”
We have spread the most salient facts regarding the migration flow across the various country topics in this digest, and you can find the full report [**here**](https://frontex.europa.eu/assets/Publications/Risk_Analysis/Risk_Analysis/Risk_Analysis_for_2019.pdf) \.
#### GREECE
### Islands

The UNHCR has reported that the past week, 192 people arrived on the Aegean islands, a decrease from last week’s 803 arrivals and from last year’s 432 arrivals during the same period\.

According to their report, 15,000 refugees and migrants reside currently on the Aegean islands\. The majority are from Afghanistan \(45%\), Iraq \(13%\) and the State of Palestine \(9%\) \. Women account for 21% of the population and children for 32%, of whom more than 60 percent are younger than 12 years old\.

17% of the children are unaccompanied or separated from their families, mainly from Afghanistan\. Some 41% are men between 18 and 39 years old\.

### Athens

**Collective kitchen for financial support for Ebuka’s family will be organised this Saturday at 13h, address: Tsamadou 15 \(garden\), Exarcheia**


> On February the 8th Ebuka, an immigrant from Nigeria, lost his life under uncertain circumstances at the Omonoia police station, after being taken in\. The police station kept his death a secret from his family for 3 whole days\. This fact is undeniable proof that the police is trying since the first moment to conceal the true causes, that led to Ebuka’s death\.
 

>  His wife is left alone with two little children, 5 years old and 6 years old\. The mother and her two children need our support, since our family has been left without income\. We stand by their side for as long as it’s needed\. As a first step, we’re organizing on Saturday 9th of March a collective kitchen, the incomes of which will be given to them\. 
 

>  Aside from the dark and the wilderness, the people of resistance and solidarity is sending a strong message\. Nobody is alone\. These people, our people, need to live with dignity\. To these kids, and to this woman we owe a better world\. A world with freedom, social justice and equal rights for all people\. For this kind of world we will never stop fighting, solidarity is our weapon, our most valued weapon\.
 

>  Justice for Ebuka\. His family is not alone\.

#### BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
### Tightening border control

The Ministry of Security of Bosnia and Herzegovina plans to deploy Hungarian border forces on the border with Serbia and Montenegro “in order to strengthen control and prevent announced plight of migrants” \(sic\! \), Serbian [media](https://www.blic.rs/vesti/republika-srpska/veca-kontrola-ulaska-migranata-na-granici-bih-prema-srbiji-i-crnoj-gori-u-ispomoc/njg20h5?fbclid=IwAR0Rk_ADS0MJdA-Zwc5jFzgrpBOPUx8tfjVz6OCzGqfLruCC4XWiWzOFtWg) have reported\.

The minister has said the Hungarians won’t have the authority of border police of Bosnia and Herzegovina, nor will they carry guns, but “they will perform monitoring of the border, which would contribute to better control and stop migrants from illegal crossing\.”
### Beware of mine fields\!

A reminder to all people on the move — Bosnia and Herzegovina is still one of the most mine\-contaminated countries in the Southeast Europe region\. Pay attention and stay safe\.

### Need for aid and support in border areas of Bosnia

Experienced volunteers are needed to help locals providing aid to people on the move in the area of Velika Kladuša and Tuzla\. The situation there is highly specific and the need for help differs from month to month as it changes, but help is always needed\. If you are willing to help and commit for a week or more, please contact us to put you in touch with those who can give you detailed information on the situation and what can be done\.

An [International team](https://www.facebook.com/aidbrigade/?__tn__=%2CdkCH-R-R&eid=ARDvvOxaPIe7HXYy6J8Xle1ExmsevI0jwb7WaMu1wKamBbXlW_g2LjA6jRWgZ9AdUIL9ESsUt9OwNrnQ&hc_ref=ARSrD3ZY9VgwjvPiQzbKswfwCqnI6vj1BTpBykxMFg6XOH_zhNKs0YF6Cr6jfadI3Ug&fref=nf) of volunteers currently present in Ušivak refugee camp in Sarajevo, where around 700 people are staying, is also calling for volunteers to join their already formed groups\. “We provide daily activities such as sports, arts, games and cinema for all as well as special activities for women and children\. We also assist with hygiene and clothes distributions\. People are often transiting fast, so we can provide the stuff they most desperately need and add a little bit of relief before people try to cross the dangerous Croatian border\.”

### Rome

Salvini’s security degree and the lack of reception or sensibility from the side of the Roman mayor have made it even more difficult for many homeless people in the capital, the Globalist [reports](https://www.globalist.it/news/2019/03/05/effetto-raggi-salvini-rifugiati-costretti-a-dormire-sul-greto-del-tevere-in-centro-2038281.html?fbclid=IwAR1eg9xlLzDKriX_OrRVdp-sRe_8X2M0GXNyfe1tYefQDxGo4g7tDKo0WCc) , documenting more and more people sleeping on the banks of the Tiber in the city, which could easily drown them one of these days if the water rises…


> All this after the events of the last few months when many poor and abandoned people have died of cold\. 
 

> What to say? These things happen in the capital, while the only ones who are ending up being criminalized are those who try to help the least ones\. 





Help by and for those who practice solidarity is in the heart of the 29th edition of the [Guide for the city of Rome: Where to eat / sleep / wash](https://www.santegidio.org/pageID/30144/langID/en/Where-the-Guides.html) , edited by the Sant’Egidio Community\.

A guide was recently published with the intention of trying to provide information for the many problems that homeless people experience, offering some solutions and addresses: where to eat, sleep, wash, get care; orientation centers, reception centers; very useful social and personal services; health care, judicial offices, work, training, retirement, housing\. This is information that unfortunately proves equally useful for those refugees and asylum seekers caught in the jaws of the asylum system\(s\) and affected by the recent Salvini decree\.

### Dunkirk

It is estimated there are around 500 displaced people currently living in the Dunkirk area\. The emergency centre continues to operate at maximum capacity, meaning the number of people camping outside its doors has continued to grow, [Mobile Refugee Support](https://www.facebook.com/MobileRefugeeSupport/?__tn__=%2CdkCH-R-R&eid=ARDcJfLwKy5z3YBL9iCuhdY1eiyJhfqlX9a7Kf33QuTDUQ--u4C-fwVWl4w0f808XVtbl9pa0BMI9SlW&hc_ref=ARS_D-36BAmoyusbAaCfEyhysmRzf54M8ylr8bmoHcQl9MXE3Mguu9tX8vs6NR19fGQ&hc_location=group) reports\.

### Lyon

On Friday and Saturday, the detainees of the CRA of Lyon St\-Exupéry went on a hunger strike to protest against the CRA system, the poor conditions of detention centres, and the police repression they experience on a daily basis\.
