### Feature: Niger ‚Äî The EU

We turn our attention to the growing issue of externalizing asylum procedures and Europe‚Äôs borders\. Journalist Sara Creta wrote an excellent thread describing the recent turmoil in Niger for the 2,900 people evacuated to the country by UNHCR as a safety measure\. They were promised to be resettled in EU countries:

> **[Sara Creta](https://twitter.com/saracreta) @ Twitter Says:** 

> > By August, only 59 %, (1,723 people) have been resettled, but what will happen to those that do not meet resettlement requirements remains unclear. 

Without access to resettlement these people are left in a limbo rather than with a sustainable solution.

2 camps have opened: one by UNHCR in which people have ‚Äúprotested the dire conditions in the new transit centres, including food and water\-shortages and a lack of medical care‚Äù and another where the so\-called ‚Äòself\-evacuated‚Äô Sudanese refugees are hosted\.‚Äù It‚Äôs like ‚Äúbeing dumped in the middle of the desert\.‚Äù This is what happened on Monday:

Some have been left in limbo for years with the promise of reaching Europe under no durable solutions\.

For more of an in depth look from volunteers in Niger read our AYS Special: [How the EU externalized its border into Niger\.](ays-special-how-the-eu-externalized-its-border-into-niger-afe7fa3de009)

On another subject matter which you won‚Äôt regret checking out is AYS‚Äôs updated Special on [last week‚Äôs event in Iraq](ays-special-updates-from-baghdad-2-aa711055b5c5) \. Kidnappings of demonstrators and activists are on the rise‚Ä¶\.
### Morocco

Updates from [Association Marocaine des Droits Humains ‚Äî Section Nador](https://www.facebook.com/AmdhNador/photos/a.1693125780899690/2495185240693736/?type=3&theater) \. Many refugees were injured Sunday night during attacks in Nador:


> ‚Äú7 are dead, 22 injured were received in the nador hospital\. Only 5 women and 3 injured men are still in the hospital\. The other 14 were arrested by the police once they received the care\. The most important point of this drama is the death of a mother who left a 7\-Month\-old baby who was rescued\. Amdh Nador also found testimonies that confirmed that the cause of this wreck was the fire that spread quickly in the zodiac because of the winds\. Migration policies kill, but traffickers who organize a conveyed of 91 migrants in these weather conditions are real criminals\.‚Äù 




### Sea
#### There have been several shipwrecks and people missing in the Mediterranean in the last day\.

### Greece

[Team Humanity](https://www.facebook.com/TeamHumanityDK/posts/1510908049078200) provided this update on their founder Salam Aldeen‚Äôs case \(who was arrested on Wednesday on charges that he was a ‚Äúpublic threat‚Äù by the Greek police\):


> ‚ÄúSalam still sits behind bars at Lesvos, now on the 6th day\. Fortunately, we have some good lawyers on the case, in Lesvos but also Athens\. A Danish lawyer was also contacted\. The Foreign Ministry in Denmark says that they are working on the case\!? We want to thank everyone for your support‚Ä¶Thanks also to all the Danish media who have referred to the case\. We hope that all of this will put pressure on the Greek authorities to release Salam\. We send warm thoughts to Salam\. We will continue to work in our center\. We are needed in Moria camp\. Furthermore, we send a loving thought to Salam‚Äôs family in Denmark\. We will do everything we can to take good care of him and get him free\.‚Äù
