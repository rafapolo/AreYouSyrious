#### Feature story — 37th day of hunger strike for T, imprisoned in Italian detention centre

[Macerie published an update](https://www.autistici.org/macerie/) on the protest and the condition of T, a detainee in Italian CPRs \(detention centres\), on his 37th day of hunger strike\. For weeks now he has been in touch with Radio Black Out, an activist radio based in Turin\. Listen to his testimonies: [1](https://radioblackout.org/podcast/diretta-con-un-recluso-nel-cpr-di-torino/) , [2](https://radioblackout.org/podcast/diretta-con-due-reclusi-nel-cpr-di-torino-25-02-19/) \(in Italian and English\) \.

AYS recently published [a special about his story and the conditions in Italian detention centres](ays-special-about-cpr-italian-pre-deportation-centres-an-administrative-hell-c7ce07502561) \.

At the weekend, after more than a month of hunger strike and in a serious health condition, and after several days of protest held by people in solidarity in Turin, T was suddenly transferred from the centre to the CPR in Bari\. In his demands he states that he would prefer to be deported to Algeria than being in the CPR, but the deportation has been halted for bureaucratic reasons\.

T is protesting against the inhumane conditions in the CPRs and in order to re\-gain his freedom\. After 37 days of hunger strike his condition is very serious, he is weak and he needs a wheelchair to move\.

Last week he was moved to the hospital wing of the CPR\. Even there, rooms look more like those of a prison than of a hospital\. Detainees are often left there for hours or even days after all too frequent self\-harm, or after being beaten by the guards\. This is also the area where many people are taken before being deported, in order to be sedated before travelling\.

T was beaten by the guards and then transferred to a city hospital, where doctors refused to talk with him and asked about his condition only through the agents who were escorting him\. Doctors ignored the physical signs of the beatings, and declared that he was in a fit condition to be brought back into the CPR\.

People in solidarity organised two protests\. In one, they gathered in front of the hospital to protest against the complicity of the medical staff in the detention of a seriously ill person, and marched from there to the CPR\. A second protest was organised in front of the council office for social policies\. The spokesperson of the local council commented that “if \[T\] dies, it’s the doctors’ fault, not ours\.”

Now T is 1,000 km from Turin\. The authorities took his phone from him, but T memorised the activists’ numbers and managed to keep them updated on what was happening to him, who then activated local networks of solidarians\.

**Detention centres — throughout Europe and the wider Mediterranean — are a centrepiece of the European border regime introduced in the last few years\. With push backs and deportations they are the proof of the illegal and criminal nature of EU policies towards people on the move\. Administrative detention is the way EU states ignore and bend laws and rights, imprisoning people who did not commit any crime, without any legal safeguard, with no access to information on their future or decent healthcare\.**

\#if you are not angry, you are not paying attention\#
#### PROTESTS IN EUROPE — Anti\-Racism Day and calls to end EU\-Turkey deal

There were protests all over Europe this weekend against racism, often citing the attack in Christchurch, New Zealand, and calling for an end to the EU\-Turkey deal which has now kept thousands of people trapped on the islands of Greece for the last three years\.

Together we are strong\!

This weekend after [one week of occupation](https://www.facebook.com/events/380566482797266/) in front of the parliament with no reaction from the government people spent Sunday writing letters to the minister of justice and prime minister\.

The letters make the five demands refugees have made:

1\. No more deportations — 2\. Substantial review for everyone — 3\. Equal access to health care — 4\. Work permit — 5\. Closing down of the refugee camp in Ásbrú\.


> The occupation in Austurvöllur will continue until authorities agree to the request of starting negotiations series with representatives from refugees in Iceland about these five demands\. The second request is to temporarily stop all deportations while negotiations are ongoing\. 





LIBYA
#### Four people dead in detention

[Sally Hayden reports](https://twitter.com/sallyhayd/status/1107305859967868929?fbclid=IwAR295Q_rcoI7WBJmzxzALVn_yGCut-cj9NJ59gXAx-yr9eZ5uilxGBgT4CM) that detainees have told her of the deaths of four people in Gharyan detention centre\. They say 28 detainees were forcibly moved there from Zintan yesterday\.


> Libyan guards apparently lied to some, saying they were going to Tripoli for medical treatment\. 





It is not known how these individuals lost their lives\. What is clear is that their deaths are on Europe’s hands\.

MOROCCO
#### Bodies not identified, families not informed

A new [report by Platforme National de Protection Migrants \(PNPM\)](http://www.pnpm.ma/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Rapport-Morts-aux-Frontieres-PNPM28-2-2019-Version-Finale.pdf) states that identification rates for bodies found along the Moroccan coast line ranges from 2% in Tangier and 18% in Nador\. The report suggests that survivors should be allowed to help in the identification of the dead instead of being immediately detained and that families should not face detainment or imprisonment when they come to identity the body of a loved one\.

International law obliges states to respect the dead, the first step of which is identification\. What is also highlighted is the emotional impact of never knowing what happened to your family member or friend and the practical implications for inheritance\.

WESTERN MEDITERRANEAN ROUTE
#### Widespread exploitation and abuse on the Western Mediterranean route

A [survey](https://www.iom.int/news/western-mediterranean-nearly-half-recent-spain-migrant-arrivals-report-exploitation-abuse?fbclid=IwAR1uv_wYQIO12hYpL7JErbEJBiqDrJB3sURwTFPIL4ITbPhll0RPqSZBWq4) was conduced by IOM in 2018 during which they interviewed more than 1,300 migrants and refugees who had arrived in Spain\.

Nearly half of them \(48%\) “indicated having at least one direct experience related to human trafficking, exploitation or abuse while travelling on the Western Mediterranean Route\.”

63,325 arrived to Spain through such routes in 2018, making it the main point of entrance into Europe\. The most common route is through Mali \(Bamako\) to Algeria \(Algiers, Oran, Tamanrasset\) and then to Morocco \(Casablanca or Rabat and then Nador or Tangier\) \.


> “The results of this survey show an alarming incidence of reported exploitation and abuse of migrants and refugees along the route\. It is striking how varied their motivations and experiences are, and we do not always realize the very high levels of vulnerability in play\.” \( _Maria Jesus Herrera, IOM Chief of Mission in Spain_ \) 





As we already reported, no evidence of a significant shift from the Central Mediterranean to the Western Mediterranean has been shown\. Only 1\.3% of the people surveyed “indicated that they had changed their route and headed towards Niger or Algeria after time spent in Libya”\.

SEA
#### 3 people died and many are still missing in the Western Mediterranean

One person has already been rescued\. They were trying to reach Spain from Sidi Warzeg\.

A boat with 56 people [has been rescued by the Moroccan Navy](https://twitter.com/HelenaMaleno/status/1107542506781265920) early on Monday morning\. 3 dead bodies have been found on board\. The alarm was raised yesterday by human rights defenders\.

Helena Maleno Garzon [reported on Sunday](https://twitter.com/HelenaMaleno/status/1107179959146242048) that 2 more boats were missing in the Gibraltar strait, carrying 8 and 10 people\.

SEA
#### NGO boat back at sea

#### More deaths at sea predicted

Andalusian organisation [Pro Derechos Humanos](https://twitter.com/APDHA/status/1106881609389748224?fbclid=IwAR182PJMaCOSdPtAsXc_EmX2DP2U0ryLNCO6ToI1Jc-Y-7LoDoIgArcN2PY) predict an increase in deaths at sea following the new agreements with Morocco regarding the coordination of sea rescue operations\. 45 people have already died since Morocco took over coordination and the group states that the Moroccan government do not have the human resources or materials to do this task competently\.

Alarm Phone have confirmed their concerns as they try to locate 6 people lost at sea\.

#### FRONTEX Map — A Sanitised State Lie

FRONTEX have [published a map](https://frontex.europa.eu/along-eu-borders/migratory-map/) , stating it depicts the current migratory map of Europe\. What it does not show is the pain and suffering along the routes, it does not list the deaths, it does not show the bodies which wash up on both sides of the Mediterranean\. It describes everyone as ‘migrants’ to suggest that they have all chosen this journey in life, have chosen to risk their lives and potentially lose their loved ones\. It does not show torture in Libya\. It does not show the repercussions of EU funding to the Libyan coast guard or the real life impacts of the EU\-Turkey deal\. It is a state funded lie to ease the consciences of governments and politicians throughout the EU who continue to militarise borders, legitimise dictatorial regimes and endanger people’s lives\.

GREECE
#### Arrivals

According to the Aegean Boat Report two boats arrived on the Greek islands at the weekend\.

[One boat arrived on Samos](https://www.facebook.com/AegeanBoatReport/posts/541542903035485) on Sunday morning, carrying 35 people \(no breakdown available\) \.

[A second boat](https://www.facebook.com/AegeanBoatReport/posts/541955919660850) arrived in the night on Lesvos, with 42 people onboard\. It was picked up outside Tsonia, on the north\-eastern coast at 03\.20 by Frontex\. No breakdown is available\.
#### Vaccination campaign in Vathy, Samos

Over the weekend MSF operated a [vaccination campaign](https://twitter.com/MSF_Sea/status/1107226472182415361?fbclid=IwAR3-eXq6F-_RjWB_8_fA1qkEJ6v347CJPna4ctLUv6JX_yPh-sy55_M07PI) in Vathy camp, in Samos in which there are “more than 800 children who live under inhumane and unhygienic conditions”\.
#### More attacks on refugees

After last week’s racist attack on refugees on Chios, Alarm Phone report another attack near Athens:

Just 2 hours after their arrival to the hotel, the mob attacked them and barged into their rooms\. \[…\] The man in the video was in his room when three men broke the door\. They rammed a fire extinguisher into his chest and scared his children\. The group reached out to Alarm Phone because none of them dare to step outside the hotel\. They are asking for help and protection\.”

> It has taken us some days to post about what we lived on the 8th March, but that is only because we are still digesting what has happened\. It was an amazing, very emotional and unique feeling that we experienced all together\. We have proved again that women working together are stronger than divided\. That we fight, celebrate and live not just on the Women’s Day, but every day of the year\. And that every single day for us is a struggle and a ground for raising our figure\. From S\.T 17 we are working for our empowerment by fighting against the heteropatriarchal capitalistic system and by looking for new alternative ways of life, with feminism always as one of our main principles\.
 

> Together we stand for the manifesto that we read and together we protested in the march\. We were happy and excited to share the space with other people who fight for the same ideas\. 





> All of us together, we support the women struggle and we shout: 





> WE ARE FEMINISTS\.

They, like all other people travelling from Sarajevo to Bihac by bus, were stopped by the local police at irregular and illegal check points, forced to leave the bus, and left by the road\.

[IOM](https://medium.com/u/664cb26312d4) , [UN Refugee Agency](https://medium.com/u/75f2bdd89854) , DRC and other international agencies are aware that this has been happening since October 2018, but have done nothing to pressure local authorities to change this practice\. Additionally, the government, which is responsible for taking care of people on the move in Bosnia, is completely ignoring this situation\.
#### IOM refuses to allow people into BIRA and other camps

Due to rules that are never clearly explained, [IOM \- UN Migration](https://medium.com/u/664cb26312d4) do not allow people to enter camps and register\. As a consequence, about 100 people are sleeping rough around BIRA camp\. People are left outside Miral, Velikla Kladusa, too\.


![Outside Bira Camp \(Photo taken by people who are sleeping outside the camp\)](assets/a7af490f819b/1*kQegcaj6j3EqhL10DyjzEA.jpeg)

Outside Bira Camp \(Photo taken by people who are sleeping outside the camp\)

According to such rules, if somebody leaves the camps, they have 48 hours to come back\. If they come after this period of time, they cannot enter the camp\. Many people go to cross the border and sometimes they came back after several days \(fore example those who are pushed back from Slovenia\) and often they are injured, tired and hungry, but IOM leaves them outside\.

Additionally, they do not intend to register new people in the camp, and all new arrivals are left outside\. People who are outside cannot get food or any kind of help\.

This behaviour is hard to understand from an international organization involved in providing assistance to people on the move in Bosnia\. Why are they helping only those who are inside camps?

More people are arriving daily, and many get no help at all\. In Bihac, only small groups of local volunteers are able to work outside the camp and to help, as well as in Kladusa\.

The conditions within the camps are dreadful as always:
