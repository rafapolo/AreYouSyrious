### FEATURE: Over 200 people evicted from Bihać and brought to Lipa

On Wednesday morning, two of the biggest informal settlements in Bihać were evicted, and over 200 people were brought to what is now considered the official Lipa camp\. Journalist Franziska Grillmeier reported from on the ground while the evictions were happening\. She provided many videos of the police driving [busses of people](https://twitter.com/f_grillmeier/status/1364461044354207751) and denying the [press access](https://twitter.com/f_grillmeier/status/1364473137279205376) \.


> “This is a repeating pattern that reportedly happens every few months to the abandoned houses around Bihac — most of the evicted people walked back from Lipa to Bihac again, since there was never enough space in the camp\. People are calm right now\. Buses waiting… 





> …People queue in a line\. It has 1 degree right now\. Most men were woken up early\. They packed sleeping bags and belongings in a backpack, now they wait quietly to enter the bus\.” 





[No Name Kitchen](https://www.facebook.com/NoNameKitchenBelgrade/posts/1187177418347207) shared a letter from a resident of the Lipa camp, explaining the situation and providing insight for why people keep trying to leave and find accommodation elsewhere:


> “I live in Lipa Camp in Bosnia\. The hardest time at Lipa Camp is when we cook\. We cook our own food because the food we can get when we wait in a line we do not like\. There is no place for us to cook in this camp\. Everyone cooks food in a fire in a nearby forest where there is no roof\. And we do all this under the open sky\. There is no kitchen facility, and we have to cook every day in the extreme cold\. The wood is not dry and it is very difficult to start a fire because it is rainy and snowy season and Lipa is a place where it is very difficult to do all this in winter\. We have to handle all this every day…
 

> …If I explain about bathrooms: only a dozen chemical toilets for more than a thousand people\. No running water to drink\. Often we are short on water…
 

> …About COVID\-19: Camp operators swear COVID doesn’t spread within the camp, but there’s no way to verify or control it\. Also other sicknesses as scabies spread throughout all people\. The tents we live in are very small\. In a small tent we have 30 people which makes it very crowded\. At the moment with an epidemic like COVID\-19 in the world it is very difficult to live in these tents and if human beings also get this disease here, many lives will be lost\. We request to make a checkup system here so that a good COVID\-19 test can be done and an isolation system can be made to avoid the problem\.” 





They finish with a reminder to the EU Commissioner for Home Affairs, who visited Lipa camp a few days ago that the EU is 100% to blame for the horrible conditions people are being forced to live in Bosnia\.

Forcing people back into a hellish camp cannot be the answer\.

[Afghanistan Migrants Advice & Support Org](https://www.facebook.com/AmasoAfg/posts/4097977903565796) just published an update:


> “Today, our director met with one of those deported from Germany to Afghanistan on 9 February 2021\. Azimi is a young and wise person who was deported along with 25 others\. Opposite to what the German authorities claim, Azimi has not been involved in a single activity inside Germany that could be deemed as illegal\. Instead, he was very well integrated and had gone to school until class 11th\. All his family members are either in Turkey or back in Germany\. He doesn’t have any social network in Afghanistan and didn’t know much about the services available for him after his arrival to Afghanistan\. We have advised him about several things today and will stay in touch with him to monitor his situation\.”

### Reports of another pushback

According to Aegean Boat Report:


> “Last Friday, 19 February, a boat carrying 31 people tried to cross from Turkey towards Lesvos south\. Deep inside Greek territory waters they where stopped by a vessel from the Hellenic coast guard, and forced to return to Turkish waters by gun point\.
 

> The boat started the trip before first light, but around 8 am they where stopped by the Hellenic coast guard\. The vessel is identified to be ΛΣ 618, from videos sent to the Aegean Boat Report, and is stationed in Mytilíni, Lesvos\. The boat in question is one of two Faiakas\-class fast patrol crafts \(FPCs\) currently operated by the Hellenic Coast Guard\. Also in the videos we can see four men, in black military outfits, faces covered with balaclavas, on the front deck of the vessel\. Previously it has been denied that HCG personnel use balaclavas in their operations, but as we can see footage tells a different story\. People from the rubber dinghy explains that one of the men in front of the boat used a shotgun, and fired several shots towards their boat, to force them to turn the boat around back towards Turkey, they feared for their lives and turned the boat around, they had no choice\.”

These are 13 Afghans who went to a state reception structure, where police told them at night that they would be taken for a coronavirus test, but after locking them in a container for an hour, they forced them into a van for the port, where they boarded, hitting them them, onto a boat, to leave them in the middle of the sea in an inflatable boat before being picked up by the Turkish Coast Guard\._ ”

### Home Office “accelerating” moving people out of hotels into permanent housing

The Independent reports that “A letter sent to NGOs by the department states that people seeking asylum who are currently in hotels will start being “decanted” out of the accommodation as part of a process called Operation Oak\. Hotels have formed a major component of the Home Office’s solution to coping with the backlog of people waiting for a decision on their asylum claims\. There are said to be around 9,500 in hotels at present\. Charities supporting asylum seekers welcomed the planned move out of hotels, which have been the subject of mounting concern over poor conditions and treatment by staff, but said they were worried about a lack of clarity around the standard of housing people would be moved to\.” Learn more [here](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/asylum-seeker-hotel-accommodation-home-office-b1806087.html?amp&fbclid=IwAR0jhwlYInPXSARvm9Fz7oYSZ7PJVWVlK-z4AtiuCzPBWvK7Z04Kk2GhWq8) \.
