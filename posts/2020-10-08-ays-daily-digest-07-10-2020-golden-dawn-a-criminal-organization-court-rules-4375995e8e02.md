#### FEATURE — Golden Dawn Ruled a Criminal Organization

Thousands of people erupted into cheers in the streets of Athens as a court ruled that the Golden Dawn party was a [criminal organization](https://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2020/10/07/verdict-golden-dawn-trial-guilty/#.X32QoU_jYwZ.facebook) , after five years of trials\.

The court also ruled on several crimes committed by Golden Dawn members, cases that demonstrate the extent of their terrorist acts\. Ten defendants were found guilty of the murder of anti\-fascist rapper Pavlos Fyssas\. The court also handed down guilty verdicts in the attempted murders of several Egyptian fishermen and assault on trade unionists\.

While this is a wonderful verdict for Greece, this does not mean that the country is automatically a safer place for people on the move, leftists, and others who may run afoul of Nazis\. Immediately after the verdict, police violently dispersed the celebrating crowd with [tear gas and water cannons](https://www.euronews.com/2020/10/07/watch-violent-clashes-after-landmark-golden-dawn-verdict-in-athens) \(the links between Greek police and far\-right extremists have been well\-documented in the past\) \.

While the party may be outlawed, the environment that helped it thrive is still rampant\. As [Keep Talking Greece](https://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2020/10/07/verdict-golden-dawn-trial-guilty/#.X32QoU_jYwZ.facebook) put it, “The snake’s head is cut but its eggs are still here and some have already hatched\.” Politicians may publicly praise the verdict while remaining cozy with Golden Dawn figures, including the speaker of parliament who granted one of the defendants a job in parliament [just six days ago](https://twitter.com/damomac/status/1313803741909471232) \. One of the defendants is a sitting member of the European Parliament\. They also continue to enact fascist policies, such as illegal border pushbacks\.

The [constant fear](https://twitter.com/OmairaGill/status/1313746001417699328) that the Golden Dawn provoked as it terrorized the people it hated, especially minorities and people on the move, will not go away overnight, nor will its followers slink away quietly\.

Even though the Golden Dawn is officially recognized as a criminal organization, the government policies that dehumanize people on the move and shove them into unlivable camps are in action\. The mainstream media still routinely dehumanize people on the move\. There are still many cases of vigilante violence against people on the move, even if the perpetrators are not openly affiliated with Golden Dawn\.

This verdict is a wonderful turning point and should be celebrated\. However, there is still work to be done to eradicate Golden Dawn’s beliefs entirely, especially as so many people on the move face violence from the state and their neighbors\.

#### LIBYA
#### Horrific Crime: Man Burned Alive in Tripoli

A young Nigerian worker was [burned alive](https://twitter.com/fedsoda/status/1313807269784702976?fbclid=IwAR1vQByW-6vx9skfGScc5CQz0nfkSHAA9jdrFhHWwcbyc8ISPucEgoVsTP8) in Tripoli on Tuesday\. The interior ministry said that they [arrested three suspect](https://www.reuters.com/article/libya-migrants-int-idUSKBN26S2JX?fbclid=IwAR2tW3vs-7WuP9ROtXtoJKVjwjTolw4QN3nla4QUbcNCQtt0-LvBdgeivzI) s in the case\. However, their arrests will not do much to combat the rampant violence against people on the move, both on the ground from xenophobic people and by “official” actors in torture camps\.

This case should only provide more evidence that Libya cannot be considered a safe third country for people on the move, yet the Libyan Coast Guard is allowed to carry out pushbacks, often with the active support of the EU\. Sea\-Eye [reported](https://sea-eye.org/en/illegal-push-back-by-the-so-called-libyan-coast-guard/?fbclid=IwAR39l5rW-moWwKl6p1vm8E4OUGPr_8c7eT-31l0yPyGTxZnuOAhp--YxAXU) that the Alan Kurdi had to carry out a rescue operation swiftly to avoid the so\-called coast guard taking the people back\.
#### TUNISIA
#### Confusion About Agreements with Italy

Earlier this year, Tunisia signed an agreement with Italy where the North African nation received [eleven million euros](https://it.euronews.com/2020/08/18/a-tunisi-di-maio-e-lamorgese-soldi-in-cambio-di-controlli?fbclid=IwAR0Sgl1YgKGqIIfXNsXOtzGWTdqozU6yUtftzJd6TyeQfzuNuDGKFGF4BDk) to strengthen coastal controls and restart repatriation\. However, civil society in Tunisia is [unhappy with the deal](https://it.euronews.com/2020/10/06/migranti-in-tunisia-si-chiedono-che-accordo-abbiamo-firmato-con-l-italia-fateci-vedere-il-) \. The full contents have not been disclosed to the public yet, and the government shows no signs of sending the agreement to Parliament even though the constitution requires international treaties to be ratified by the legislature\. Migration deals between Tunisia and Italy that ignore parliamentary processes have been [going on for decades](https://twitter.com/saracreta/status/1313604667239288837) \. Activists also pointed out that the agreement was signed under pressure as Italy [threatened to block](https://en.qantara.de/content/flight-and-migration-from-the-maghreb-under-pressure-tunisia-accepts-unusual-deportations?fbclid=IwAR3I5qVKzJcgU_L6O_PMTWQtskfD7HFbyYI-j1sjccyPMvbCze98AXB-W2I) promised developmental aid as migration from Tunisia to Italy increased\. How can the EU preach about promoting democracy when its member states circumvent democratic processes in other countries to get what they want?
#### SEA
#### Shipping Union’s Open Letter Calls for EU\-Wide Measures on Disembarkations

The shipowner’s association and Transport Worker’s Federation [penned an open letter](https://twitter.com/EU_shipping/status/1313851762374213632/photo/1) to the EU calling for new measures granting merchant vessels “prompt and predictable disembarkations” to be added to the EU migration pact\. The unions are concerned that under the current pact, humanitarian crises where merchant vessels rescue people in distress but cannot find a port of safety will continue\. The letter comes after several standoffs involving merchant vessels, including the Maersk Etienne\.

In happier news, a boat that left Morocco and was reported to be in distress by relatives [safely reached Spain](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1313767378484948993?fbclid=IwAR1_eho4IDx37CHqbR_nVI9BiBDHkeuvB8r4e2BnoSrtIGvm5CwUoh8qJSg) \.

#### GREECE
#### Inhumane Conditions for People on the Move Across the Country

They say those who do not learn from past mistakes are doomed to repeat them\. Those who do not consider past actions mistakes will repeat them with even more gusto, as Greece’s response to the Moria fire shows\. The new camp has been dubbed “Moria 2\.0” and is replicating all of the mistakes of the previous one\. [This article](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/oct/07/moria-20-refugees-who-escaped-fire-now-living-in-worse-conditions?fbclid=IwAR3B5PdCIWR9Vbb2ZuAOTaT6ehdvBhKBH-RtK1vvEq8qnlBhogvc8p3roaw) gives a rundown of the conditions there, from the lack of running water to heavily restricted freedom of movement\.

■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 


1,600 people have been moved to the mainland, where conditions are not much better\. Many recipients of asylum wind up homeless and [sleeping rough](https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/politik-gesellschaft/fluechtlinge-wie-treibgut-im-haeusermeer-von-athen-li.109503?fbclid=IwAR2Oq6F1xrBqhZvOHi6wTYpotf5Oy30WeDi8PD6PHfvr-Z-XO7tYZa3phuo) on the streets of Athens, and advocates fear that people transferred from Moria will soon join them\.

Illegal pushbacks have reached a new, despicable low as not even those with valid protection status, who find themselves hundreds of kilometers away from a border, are safe\. Greek police have begun rounding up people on the move across the country, transporting them to Evros, robbing them of their possessions including white cards, and [pushing them across the border](https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/news-feature/2020/10/07/Greece-migrant-pushbacks-expulsion-Evros-Turkey?fbclid=IwAR2gFv66i1-btvMoO9AOWZz4TX5L_2zMIRUVFc2JtCNJGnTLibl1ydagkIM) \. This new tactic is a blatant violation of a person’s right to protection whild their asylum application is being processed and is chilling in its arbitrary nature — the message is clear that no person of color is safe, regardless of immigration status\.
#### European Solidarity?

Greece’s minister of migration told reporters that the current [EU pact will fail](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-migration-asylum-seekers-plan-will-fail-unless-other-countries-share-burden-says-greek-migration-minister/?fbclid=IwAR0Ih_KpmY36rTjPS29LyO4NRjldm7HB5wZrRRnwBIP2e4N6c7WCOHiX-R0) unless it addresses solidarity properly\. He said that it is crucial for there to be a fair redistribution of asylum seekers across the bloc, an act opposed by eastern countries like Poland, otherwise coastal states will be treated unfairly\.

Perhaps in an attempt to redefine solidarity, Poland sent 156 housing units to Greece in an act defined as “ [practical solidarity\.](https://twitter.com/TihomirSabchev/status/1313782790593359872?fbclid=IwAR0x7coSL2Bb0DoyoDTsBYBS_SuFaa0yJLAy9GOUAG0PghhJD-nN7jPvQWE) ” Of course, this is better than nothing, but the only real solution to overcrowding in Greek camps is resettlement\.

Dutch activists who attempted to charter an airplane to Lesvos to pick up asylum seekers will head for Lesvos after all, except [by boat](https://www.ekathimerini.com/257760/article/ekathimerini/news/activists-catch-boat-to-lesvos?fbclid=IwAR2gFv66i1-btvMoO9AOWZz4TX5L_2zMIRUVFc2JtCNJGnTLibl1ydagkIM) \. While the act was conceived as an act of solidarity, locally based activists [are skeptical](ays-daily-digest-05-10-20-torturous-attacks-at-port-of-patras-9333112a9b56) of its effects\.
#### Prosecutor Moves to Investigate Border Violence in Evros

The Orestiada prosecutor [will investigate](https://twitter.com/lk2015r/status/1313958142514999296) complaints about border violence that occurred in the region of Evros in March\. Several locals were summoned to act as witnesses, according [to the local paper\.](https://www.evros-news.gr/2020/10/06/%ce%b1%cf%80%ce%bf%ce%ba%ce%bb%ce%b5%ce%b9%cf%83%cf%84%ce%b9%ce%ba%ce%bf-%ce%ba%ce%b1%cf%84%ce%b1%ce%b3%ce%b3%ce%b5%ce%bb%ce%af%ce%b5%cf%82-%ce%ba%ce%b1%cf%84%ce%ac-%ce%b5%ce%b2%cf%81%ce%b9%cf%84/?fbclid=IwAR2gFv66i1-btvMoO9AOWZz4TX5L_2zMIRUVFc2JtCNJGnTLibl1ydagkIM)

#### NORTH MACEDONIA
#### Five People Arrested in Smuggling Ring Bust

The people allegedly transported [at least 100 people](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/27794/five-arrested-for-migrant-smuggling-in-north-macedonia?fbclid=IwAR0FTHkedTpU5lBa0Uz_WWXiZk9skt-rRIt9vA5P5PwosNz_SJnPqGXbD34) from Greece towards Serbia\. Even as borders are formally closed, crossings and smuggling continue, often in dangerous conditions\.
#### BOSNIA & HERZEGOVINA
#### Two People Killed in Train Accident

Two people [died near Bosanski Novi](https://radiosarajevo.ba/vijesti/crna-hronika/teska-zeljeznicka-nesreca-u-bih-poginule-dvije-osobe/392368?fbclid=IwAR3vdCYmW4lEeUvrHDtQyc-AVpA17C3tI7A-bIKzvfKmVHMhl0JFohTfdPA) after they were hit by a train\. Although the investigation is ongoing, authorities believe the victims were people on the move\.
#### ITALY
#### Vigil Held for Deceased Fifteen\-Year\-Old

Residents of Palermo [held a vigil on Tuesday](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/27790/abou-death-of-a-15-year-old-migrant-provokes-tears-anger-and-questions-in-sicily?fbclid=IwAR2RDMTMK2jObGjKm2aanIM4ZEf9JnYB6EIj76pTKPYY836D77X-pQ3R6bU) for Abou, a 15\-year\-old Ivorian boy who died in a local hospital after spending 12 days quarantining on the Allegra ferry\. He experienced medical distress while on board the rescue ship Open Arms but reportedly felt better after his transfer to the Allegra\. Nobody knows for sure what happened on board the Allegra, where there is often only one doctor for 600 people, and by the time he was transferred to a mainland hospital, it was too late\. Activists are asking to get to the bottom of the neglect that caused this boy’s death, and are pointing out that endless quarantining and waiting on sea after rescues causes medical disasters such as this one\.

In the northeast of the country, the conditions in Trieste [were denounced](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/27755/unhcr-italy-denounces-problems-in-north-east-for-migrants?fbclid=IwAR2vk2IPajXwWF6TZxBvSEiYvSTRH8L7ZTh5ubhogkQjWacn1Ieh2nju1_0) by the UNHCR representative for Italy\. She said that the response is not adequate or organized\. In the northeast as well, a young person died in hospital after suffering unimaginable things along the route\. It’s clear that from the north to the south, the health and needs of people on the move are being neglected\.
#### SPAIN
#### Minister of Inclusion Announces Reform of Reception System

[The plan](https://www.eldiario.es/desalambre/escriva-negocia-comunidades-autonomas-sistema-reparto-solicitantes-asilo_1_6274588.html?fbclid=IwAR1_eho4IDx37CHqbR_nVI9BiBDHkeuvB8r4e2BnoSrtIGvm5CwUoh8qJSg) would create a regional distribution mechanism, increase the power of autonomous communities, and “be more selective” in distributing aid\. Spain has one of the greatest gaps between asylum seekers and reception capacity in the EU, and the reform is hoping to speed up backlogs\. This reform raises many questions, especially around the selection criteria for aid distribution when already many people on the move do not receive enough support\. The plan will be evaluated by the EASO before proceeding\.
#### POLAND
#### Pushbacks of Asylum Seekers at Poland\-Belarus Border

In July, the European Court of Human Rights ruled against Poland in a case lodged by Chechen asylum seekers from Russia\. You can read more details about the case and what it means for EU\-wide policy [here](https://strasbourgobservers.com/2020/10/07/systematic-push-back-of-well-behaving-asylum-seekers-at-the-polish-border-m-k-and-others-v-poland/?fbclid=IwAR3vdCYmW4lEeUvrHDtQyc-AVpA17C3tI7A-bIKzvfKmVHMhl0JFohTfdPA) \.
#### NORWAY
#### Government Proposes Quota of 3,000 People on the Move

The Norwegian government pledged to [accept 3,000 asylum seekers](https://www.utrop.no/nyheter/nytt/229586?fbclid=IwAR34bP8zvNHNuKMpgemf2gPF0jUYvXKKAEikBOu1hiY__M0p9Z-CcDWiQGQ) next year, a record number for the Scandinavian country\. The Minister for Children and Families explained that “there are more refugees on the run than ever” and Norway should do its part\.
#### UK
#### Trial in Lorry Deaths Begins

Today was the [opening day](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/oct/07/essex-lorry-deaths-39-vietnamese-migrants-suffocated-in-container-court-hears?fbclid=IwAR39l5rW-moWwKl6p1vm8E4OUGPr_8c7eT-31l0yPyGTxZnuOAhp--YxAXU) of the trial of four men for the smuggling operation that led to the deaths of thirty\-nine people\. They suffocated to death in the container of a truck after paying thousands of pounds to try and reach the UK\. The tragic event happened almost exactly a year ago\.

This is what happens when legal routes to migration are shut down — people turn to desperate and dangerous ways, and there will always be those ready to take advantage of them\.

Meanwhile, inhumane behavior towards people on the move from the government and vigilantes continues\. The Home Office decided to evict [thousands of rejected asylum seekers](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/oct/07/home-office-urged-to-halt-evictions-of-refused-asylum-seekers?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other&fbclid=IwAR3tnD7bH2y_Cd6O6ZlzYvuVgf6RsWuBgwVBjeElcHiKpjV1MgiDXXhgG1c) this week, despite protests from local officials and NGOs\. Racist policies at the very top embolden the far right, which has clung to the hysteria around Channel crossings fueled largely by the government [to generate attention](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/english-channel-crossings-migrants-boats-far-right-britain-first-b720979.html?fbclid=IwAR16FzNosy6l5y22PWFc4AQYJYTEqqL1APzdJOqZKl4QjCNSzNZhbrdNvwY) \.
#### WORTH READING

Why is transactional sex so widespread in the aid industry? Following their report on sexual abuse in the Congo during the Ebola outbreak, The New Humanitarian published an op\-ed [examining this phenomenon](https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/opinion/2020/10/06/sexual-abuse-aid-workers-again?fbclid=IwAR3I5qVKzJcgU_L6O_PMTWQtskfD7HFbyYI-j1sjccyPMvbCze98AXB-W2I) in the aid sector as a whole\. \(In case you missed it, you can read about the original investigation [here](https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/2020/09/29/exclusive-more-50-women-accuse-aid-workers-sex-abuse-congo-ebola-crisis?fbclid=IwAR0j6Wi1yT_cCbBaKIt6xE-D1O6rngIr-CI4qosAr-SzZf6d5fIJ2jgPx4s) and [here](https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/opinion/2020/10/05/Ebola-sexual-abuse-scandal-investigation?fbclid=IwAR1vQByW-6vx9skfGScc5CQz0nfkSHAA9jdrFhHWwcbyc8ISPucEgoVsTP8) \) \. Some, like the founders of NGO Safe Space, are saying that “ [it is time for aid to fall\.](https://www.thirdsector.co.uk/shaista-aziz-alexia-pepper-de-caires-time-aid-fall/policy-and-politics/article/1696505?fbclid=IwAR1dKeGHh3rrNnDttFHr-CsofEZH5yRmHLh9rM5GAZ5RrVSmkJWbLb6CHWU) ” The whole system makes gross abuses of power easy to commit and hide, and superficial reforms may not be enough\.
