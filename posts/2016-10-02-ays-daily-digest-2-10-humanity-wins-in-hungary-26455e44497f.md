Nationally, 6 percent of the ballots were spoiled\. Voters answered the satirical Two Tailed Dog Party campaign caling on voters to spoil their ballost\.
### Feature story
#### Hungarian referendum declared invalid

The national referendum on EU “migrant quotes” for Hungary is declared invalid, after turnout fell well below the minimum threshold of 50% plus 1, and despite strong hate campaign from the government and pro\-government media\. The referendum and the campaign will cost taxpayers €40,000,000\.

The morning before the referendum, [Hungarian leader Viktor Orban promised publicly that he will resign if not enough people turns out](http://ukropnews24.com/orban-said-he-will-resign-if-the-referendum-on-quotas-for-migrants-hungarians-will-vote-for/) , regardless the government having mounted the largest advertising campaign in Hungarian history\.

The referendum question was _“Are you are in favor of the EU being allowed to make the settlement of non\-Hungarians obligatory in Hungary even if the parliament does not agree?”_ Interestingly, turnout was highest in more affluent districts \(also within Budapest\) \.

Low turnout is also a victory for the opposition parties and human rights groups which called on Hungarians to boycott the referendum describing it as illegitimate\. _“The question is unconstitutional,”_ argued opposition leader Viktor Szigetvári, _“And it’s a sign of our illiberal democracy that such a formally illegal question can be put on the ballot paper\.”_ Rights campaigners described the pre\-referendum atmosphere as dark and scary\. _“The mood is quite reminiscent of the 1930s,”_ Márta Pardavi, co\-chair of the _Hungarian Helsinki Committee_ , told the media\.

Very few migrants now reach Hungary, after the country’s controversial new border fence blocked their path\. In August, Orban announced plans to build a second fence to prevent people from crossing the border\. It will stand next to its current 500km razor wire fence that runs alongside its border with Croatia and Serbia\. Orban also announced that 3000 “border hunters” will be hired to police its new border wall\. They will be equipped with trucks, night vision goggles, and sniffing dogs\.

Eastern European countries, including Hungary, Slovakia and Poland have vehemently opposed accepting migrants\. Hungary has not accepted even one of the 1,294 refugees allotted to it and is instead filing a legal case against the EU together with Slovakia\.

RELOCATION IMPORTANT CHANGES

**Greece, Italy** 
**_Main change:_** 
The countries that were eligible for relocation before this report were: Syria, Eritrea, Central African Republic, Seychelles, Dominica, Bahrain, Laos, and Saudi Arabia\. A _ccording to the latest quarterly report \(Quarter 2 2016\) published by Eurostat on 22 September, the nationalities eligible for relocation as from now are Syria, Eritrea, Burundi, Mozambique, Bahrain, Bhutan, Qatar, and Yemen_ \.

The nationalities, which met the 75% eligibility threshold according to the Eurostat data from quarter 1 of 2016, that do not meet this threshold anymore, are Central African Republic, Seychelles, Dominica, Laos and Saudi Arabia\.

Although Iraqis are no longer eligible for relocation, this does not affect those Iraqis already identified as persons in possible need for international protection \(thus, those preregistered can still be relocated\) \. This would also apply to applicants belonging to the other nationalities that are no longer eligible for relocation

### Italy
#### Rules for refugees in Como center changed

The rules for the access to Como refugees centre have changed and from today, it is not allowed for people who are in transit to show up spontaneously at the centre, but only after an interview at the police headquarters to verify the person’s law status \(meaning if this person has a residence permit or an expulsion measure pending\) \. The decision has been taken from the prefecture, in order to allocate the free placements to unaccompanied minors received in Italy\.

At the moment, the center is hosting 240 migrants, meaning around 60 places are still free\. The center will become a “hub” co\-directed by the police, which will send there the children received at the border while waiting to be allocated in other parts of the territory \(like Institute Guanella and Rebbio parish\) or out of the province\. However, in most cases, unaccompanied children leave without the trace in few days\. Free access will still be guaranteed to families and vulnerable subjects\.
