### Afghanistan


> _The control of Afghanistan by the Taliban will lead to the destruction of the country’s modern system of higher education, especially the equal right to education for the country’s women and ethnic and religious minorities\._ 





— conclusion of the [University of California](https://human-rights.ucdavis.edu/news/afghanistan-emergency-resource-information?fbclid=IwAR3GGPa8KFytY8XLiEA1S9DgHjGspCwuqZPT-wlEgX98do99-hydRWIE6FA) \.

However, many of Afghanistan’s neighboring countries refuse to open their borders and offer safety to the people, saying they undermine domestic security, according to [Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/8/19/afghanistans-ex-soviet-neighbours-panic-reject-refugees?fbclid=IwAR3G-I9XExp84PbKa3qFqIFnUErzzldSMDMVUQkyz-aio9cJxmKJFE9-73U) \.

The UN underlined that for many people there is “no clear way out” of the country\. Spokesperson Shabia Mantoo explained that more than 18,000 people have left Kabul during the week and recalled that with 2\.6 million people, Iran und Pakistan are hosting 90% of the refugee population, as Reuters [notes](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/un-refugee-agency-says-afghans-risk-have-no-clear-way-out-2021-08-20/?fbclid=IwAR1SrNjhOIN1lxUXtLKms5bczYLxAjdpP-9hBIHhKKSY6STXA-kn_qf_ETc) \. Hence, they fear another influx, France24 [adds](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210817-taliban-takeover-leaves-iran-and-turkey-fearing-refugee-influx?fbclid=IwAR0Ua38knVxIYzNouC6Rut5uU1-mj7qvyKoBQ7XqAj27WBLs0UZ-9x4-iIE) \.

Meanwhile, European countries deported some 70,000 people between 2008 and 2020, as they deemed the country safe, Vice [calculated](https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7bmq7/europe-deported-70000-to-afghanistan-deeming-it-safe?fbclid=IwAR1ENTmqjA-a6ZxgxDXVPU8N40XBg1gij-benURgAtQy8yWr1KAY_k57N8Y) \.

The first group of Afghans has arrived in Berat, as Albania has offered temporary shelter until relocation to the US, Euronews [reports](https://euronews.al/en/albania/2021/08/19/first-group-of-afghan-refugees-arriving-in-albania-to-be-housed-in-berat/?fbclid=IwAR07s-ipdA6ALbjGFtJ9aoq0BGj_W9MOL_ni77pSyHXenk-DDLMODAMyVgY) \.

### Turkey

Turkey has started building a border wall towards Iran, thus increasing its efforts to block people on the move\. According to local media, 155 of 241 kilometres are already set up, [according](https://www.euronews.com/2021/08/20/turkey-builds-a-border-wall-to-stop-refugees-from-afghanistan?fbclid=IwAR2uaehG3g4MRlMUUlo_t-br0wpSrT13M0-vu-5_2xhttzBdONeAZsgFPK0) to Euronews\.
### Libya

German TV magazine [Monitor](https://www1.wdr.de/daserste/monitor/sendungen/eu-abschottungspolitik-100.html) has shifted its focus on to the desperate situation for people trying to escape Libya, where people are exploited, tortured and raped\. They speak to survivors and analyse the situation on the ground and how the EU policy is supporting these structures\.
### Sea

With only one survivor, 53 peole died off the Canary Islands, after their boat sunk\. IOM has already recorded 250 deaths in the first six months of this year, more than twice the count of 2020, InfoMigrants [writes](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/34478/more-than-50-people-feared-dead-after-migrant-boat-sinks-off-canary-islands?fbclid=IwAR3fEkyu_zS6S8JoJZFTVw9JE62M6TqaPaFbpJ1OKyQZRRGP1t8nnrC_iJc) \.

Two boats heading to Lampedusa were blocked by the financial police within a few hours, [according](https://www.blogsicilia.it/agrigento/lampedusa-agrigento-sbarchi-migranti-barchini-48-profughi-guardia-finanza-tunisini/628401/?fbclid=IwAR0XQdz7DvXb-n9K_EU2s2IhmL4KtX1HYeeRxlYJzP1-ccRb5R2_sQdy2o0) to Blog Sicilia\.

In Greece alone, there are more than 2,000 unaccompanied minors\. “The Taliban taking over Afghanistan is also a trigger\. For many refugee children, Afghanistan is a concept that has been brought to their minds and hearts by their parents\. Now it is being destroyed,” Sonia Nandzik, a founder of ReFocus, an initiative that teaches media skills to young refugees on Lesbos, said\.

Greek representatives met around the Evros river\. They walked along the border and also had a meeting with the company Space Hellas, which is contracted for an automated border surveilance system, according to Lena K\. The group made public statements that people from Afghanistan will need months to make it to the country\. Furthermore, the government is thinking of suspending the right to apply for asylum in case many people arrive in a short period, [according](https://twitter.com/MauriceStierl/status/1428729587173928962?fbclid=IwAR3DlEpfUYdAO7SmasjbAHhJrAhefUItaqMruPQF7kJpDalXWThdwKsC79Q) to Der Spiegel\.

Lithuania has [demanded](https://euobserver.com/world/152685?fbclid=IwAR02_mjOwyaNPIv5yNF1QxW8DN1-FY4McAfd2ypax6wh87dJTJNlRRoQZuw) EU sanctions for Belarus, claiming it was using refugees as a weapon\.
