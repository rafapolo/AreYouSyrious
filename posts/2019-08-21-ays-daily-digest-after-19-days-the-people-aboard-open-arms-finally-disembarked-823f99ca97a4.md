### Feature: Outside Lampedusa

[Proactiva Open Arms](https://www.facebook.com/proactivaservice/photos/a.232810050083187/2586440461386789/?type=3&theater) announced around 2pm on Tuesday that:


> “The prosecution of agrigento dictates immediate landing of all people aboard the open arms in the port of Lampedusa and the provisional seizure of the ship\. **Finally, the nightmare is over** and the 83 people on board will receive immediate assistance on earth\. Dignity for all of them\.”

This news comes after a morning where [9 people](https://www.facebook.com/proactivaservice/photos/a.232810050083187/2585676364796532/?type=3&theater) attempted to swim to shore from the rescue ship\. The situation has been out of control for days on end, so this news could not of come any later\.

[On Monday](https://www.globalist.it/news/2019/08/19/il-parroco-di-lampedusa-open-arms-teatrino-politico-giocato-sulla-pelle-di-chi-soffre-2045283.html?fbclid=IwAR01K_Uy08SMhk_LtZW54nETdvrUgF-ggcs2DJwe0cc8ZggHHgWXkKyj7AU) , day 18, a crew member described the scene as


> “For 18 days, 107 people have lived on the deck of a ship with only two baths, exposed by day to the scorching sun of the Mediterranean and at night to the wind and in the cold: an inhuman condition aggravated by the fact that they come from the Libyan hell\.” 





[The ship](https://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2019/08/20/news/open_arms_migrante_si_getta_in_mare_recuperato-233948936/?fbclid=IwAR1CS2Ji0CE5_5jdMWSkxVUqBg35gaxqQriXSkMcFo627-EnmrN2kU8P6RE&refresh_ce) will be taken to where ships from Mediterranea Saving Humans and Sea watch were seized, but at least for now 80\+ people are safe from dying in the deadliest border in the world\.

Without delay #OpenArms must be allowed to return to sea where rescue ships are most needed to save lives.

### Turkey

Police in Istanbul increasingly randomly arrest Syrians in order to deport them back to Syria, sometimes to active war zones\. They say if the Syrians do not have proper Istanbul IDs they are returned to other parts of Turkey, but there are many cases of them being deported instead\. Find out more [here](https://vimeo.com/354813764?fbclid=IwAR0KmVg9AEq01ja1It1fX0LnDkU8YW9UVsuKBloiDxik8jqNoYFgNfvjiys) \.
### Sea

Horrifying to think about, probably 100 people died in the Mediterranean outside of Libya:


■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 
> **[Alarm Phone](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone) @ Twitter Says:** 

> > Yesterday, we spoke again to the fisherman who had informed us about the possible shipwreck off #Libya. He convincingly re-stated his testimony to us. He said the three survivors were traumatised and he handed them over to an ambulance after disembarkation in #Libya. 

> **Tweeted at [2019-08-20 11:51:01](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1163780473308557312).**

[The Libyan authorities](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1163780573502103552?fbclid=IwAR0UdrhsE6nMwpbvmw2pHL4UPQUQaIujjLtkdINk-1gHKyJkvr9ZxUFNneg) have no information on the case and have not conducted a search\. Inside the [Libyan Coast Guard](https://twitter.com/MSF_Sea/status/1163855194318409728?fbclid=IwAR2GTxcBkYKXbS_Z97tHlgejtd0hvPBdp4rZVwixcbTxW2Y0KIaoc9cSnzU) , there are even predictions that half of the boats leaving Libya sink without any survivors\. THIS IS THE DEADLIEST BORDER IN THE WORLD…we cannot even count our dead\.

With the relieving news for the people on board Open Arms, we cannot forget that:

> > 356 people have been waiting for a safe haven on #OceanViking of @msf_sea and @[SOSMedIntl](https://twitter.com/SOSMedIntl)  for 11 days. The situation there is getting more and more tense. Since the weekend the doctors on board are treating a patient in critical condition.

Also, emergencies are entitled to access to and access to health facilities without any hindrance\.’” This comes with requests for clarifications on medical treatments refugees may receive\.

### Sweden

[Afghanistan Migrants Advice & Support Org](https://www.facebook.com/AmasoAfg/photos/a.1419588361404777/2680141768682757/?type=3&theater) reports that:


> “At least 5 Afghan asylum seekers have been deported from Sweden back to Afghanistan today evening\. They will arrive in Kabul during morning hours tomorrow\.” 





The ongoing perception that Afghanistan is safe continues to perpetuate dangerous cycles for refugees\.
### Denmark
