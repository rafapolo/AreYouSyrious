Rescued people aboard the Ocean Viking in the Central Mediterranean this week\. \(Photo: [SOS MEDITERRANEE](https://twitter.com/SOSMedIntl/status/1423263849403256833) \)

**1,174** \. That’s the [number of recorded deaths in the Mediterranean](https://twitter.com/moas_eu/status/1422844961444225024) since the beginning of 2021\. In July alone, **252** people lost their lives in these waters\.

But the NGO search and rescue ships working to mitigate the terrible effects of the EU’s border policies are facing additional challenges to the daily problem of how to locate, reach and rescue those in distress at sea\. The ‘standoff at sea,’ as SOS Mediterranee put it? Disembarkation: how to get people safely and quickly off the rescue ships\.

Getting the people who have been rescued into a port of safety has been a problem for NGO ships for years, surely, as authorities often leave these ships in limbo, waiting for days with hundreds of people on board — many with severe health conditions — before they are assigned a port\.

The dramatic rescues of the past week, however, and the publicity around the terrible medical condition of the people aboard should have led to a different outcome this time — one would hope\. Several people were evacuated from the ships due to severe burns, and one pregnant woman and her partner also were allowed to leave the ship\. The condition of the remaining 553 survivors on the Ocean Viking and the 257 on the Sea Watch 3, however, are far from good\.

In a [press release](https://sosmediterranee.com/press/press-release-ocean-viking-faces-a-new-standoff-at-sea-disembarkation-is-urgently-needed/) , SOS Mediterranee called for an immediate port of safety for its passengers\. The group also called on EU Member States to “reactivate a disembarkation and relocation mechanism supporting coastal states in coordinating disembarkations\.”

“All 553 survivors, including 119 minors, four pregnant women and a three\-month\-old baby, suffer in the sweltering heat on the deck of Ocean Viking\. They urgently need to disembark in a place of safety, as do the 257 survivors currently onboard the Sea Watch 3,” the group wrote in its statement\.

Luisa Albera, the search and rescue coordinator onboard the Ocean Viking, said the following:


> In this heat on the confined space on deck, the situation can only get worse day after day\. A ship can only be a transition from a distress situation to a place of safety on land\. Making people who narrowly escaped death at sea wait for days before disembarking means putting their physical and mental health at risk\. The uncertainty adds unnecessary suffering to an already dire situation\. There have been too many standoffs at sea over the past three years and I have seen the extremely serious consequences with survivors being pushed into acute psychological distress\. 





SOS produced a short video about the current situation aboard the Ocean Viking, which can be accessed on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SOSMedIntl/status/1422951572183601161) \.

The NGO also expressed frustration in its statement at the lack of assistance from national search and rescue operations during the rescues\.

“In spite of numerous attempts to seek coordination from maritime authorities at all steps of each rescue, none of the six operations the Ocean Viking conducted were coordinated by maritime authorities\. All rescues occurred in international waters — four in the Libyan Search and Rescue Region \(SRR\), one in the Tunisian SRR and one in the Maltese SRR,” the group wrote\.

Sea Watch also released a statement on the conditions of the 257 survivors aboard its ship\. It [wrote](https://www.facebook.com/seawatchprojekt/posts/2880763408808388) :


> The health situation of the rescued persons continues to deteriorate dramatically\. Many of the people are dehydrated and suffer from seasickness\. Some of them had to receive infusions after they collapsed\. The situation of those who have infectious wounds or skin infections also continues to worsen\. 





> The medical team is working at full speed to stabilize the patients\. However, their possibilities on board are limited, the medical cases must be treated adequately on land\. 





> We demand for all our guests the immediate assignment of a port of safety by the responsible authorities\! 





Amidst the high tensions at sea this week, we should note that 4 August marks the four year anniversary of the seizure of the rescue ship Iuventa by Italian authorities\. In light of the anniversary, Amnesty International released a statement calling on the Italian authorities to stop persecutions of the crew members and other sea rescue NGOs\. Amnesty is also advocating for the criminal offense “aiding and abetting irregular entry” to be changed so that the work of search and rescue ships is decriminalized\.

Of its statement, entitled, [“Italy: A slippery slope for human rights: the Iuventa case,”](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur30/4475/2021/en/?fbclid=IwAR2J9HFc42_DwOX7jwObc8lwcm6usZfo-e3pLvQSz-8AET6GeQLrGsPDZls) Amnesty wrote:


> Since the end of 2016, Italy, along with other EU countries and with the backing of EU institutions, has created a hostile environment for human rights defenders and civil society organizations conducting rescue missions at sea, with the aim to reduce the number of people reaching Europe in search of protection or a better life\. The criminal prosecution of the crew of the Iuventa — the ship of German rescue NGO Jugend Rettet — is increasingly becoming a litmus test of the ability and willingness of Italian authorities to stop the misuse of criminal law to deter human rights defenders from assisting refugees and migrants at sea\. 





We stand with SOS Mediterranee and Sea Watch in calling for a port of safety for the rescued people\. This cannot wait even one more day\.
### MOROCCO
#### Group of Moroccans captured trying to leave by boat

A group of 42 Moroccan nationals trying to leave the country by rubber boat were caught by authorities in the village of Kariat Arkmane in Morocco’s Nador province on Tuesday, 3 August, [media reported](https://m.nadorcity.com/%D8%A5%D8%AD%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B7-%D9%85%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87%D8%AC%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%B9%D9%86%D8%B5%D8%B1-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%AD%D9%88%D8%B2%D8%AA%D9%87_a105373.html?fbclid=IwAR3OdPKIrmcMXH3kJbeHJvSnU_kYl_zfPN_apyzjBElEEnp60nhEaH61f-w) \. Kariat Arkmane is a coastal village about 25km east of the city of Nador, which itself is just south of the Spanish enclave of Melilla\.

According to the media report, authorities arrested the 42 people at dawn on Tuesday, also seizing the rubber boat and a “significant amount of gasoline”\. Additionally, three members of an “organized criminal network” were also arrested\.

The media report did not give information about the condition of the arrested people, where they are being held, nor where they intended to sail with the rubber boat\.
#### Testimonies of Torture in Melilla

Just northwest of Kariat Arkmane in Melilla, the Nador section of the Moroccan Association for Human Rights has raised an alarm over testimonies from two Moroccan men who said they were tortured by the Melilla Civil Guardia\.

The group published a short testimony from the men on its [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/AmdhNador/posts/2983808755164713) :


> Around 7 am, on the morning of 28 July we jumped the fence and accessed Melilla\. Immediately we were arrested by the civil guardia which tied our hands and returned hotly to a gate of the barrier located in Taourirt north of Mari Ouari\. We had been received by two auxiliary forces who delivered us to three FAR members who led us, bound, to a checkpoint in Taourirt\. At this post, we were tortured for 20 minutes by two of these military personnel using their belts and feet with our hands tied up, causing us serious injury\. Subsequently we were delivered to the Chiker blessed gendarmes who freed us without the establishment of any PV … 




### TURKEY

We would like to take this space to share an urgent press release concerning a transgender Syrian refugee facing deportation from Turkey:


> Transgender Syrian refugee in imminent danger of illegal deportation to Syria during lawless police crackdown in Turkey 





> A transgender refugee is in immediate danger of violence and unlawful deportation to Syria during an illegal police crackdown over Eid to purge Istanbul of refugees\. 





> “Sofia”, 23, came to Turkey as a teenage refugee with her family in 2017, after suffering intense persecution in Syria because of her gender identity\. She had been victimised since childhood for “not being masculine enough” and the abuse worsened living as a teenager when ISIS took control over the region in 2015\. Sofia lived for weeks in fear of being reported to the militias for torture and execution because of her attraction to men and her feminine identity\. 





> Sofia says, “ISIS would throw homosexuals from the tops of buildings\. Sometimes after they fell, they would stone them to make sure they were dead and do ugly things to their bodies\. They printed and distributed flyers promising a financial reward to anyone who turned in homosexuals\. They would kill them without checking if the information was true\. When I saw these flyers, I started wetting my pants\. It was out of my control\. I was terrified that someone would tell on me\.” 





> After suffering much trauma and displacement in Syria, Sofia escaped to Turkey with her family, but the abuse and harassment because of her gender identity continued\. At the age of 21 she was thrown out by her brothers for being “too feminine” and registered with the UNHCR as a vulnerable refugee for resettlement\. However there was no progress on her case, and Sofia suffered beatings both from other refugees in her male hostel, and also arbitrary harassment from police\. 





> On the evening of Friday, 23 July 2021, during the Eid celebration weekend, police staged a crackdown to rid Istanbul of refugees, illegally detaining Sofia, incarcerating her in a Turkish deportation centre and denying her access to a lawyer\. 





> Now, Sofia and her supporters fear that in a legal sleight\-of\-hand she will be forced to sign “voluntary return papers” within days, and sent back to Syria where she will once again be in danger\. Forced return to a war zone is against both Turkish and international law, but the police circumnavigate this in order to force “voluntary” returns by physical violence\. 





> Sofia’s lawyer, Fatih, who has not yet been allowed to see her in person, says, “Turkey has developed a system to send Syrian refugees back to Syria\. This system is completely illegal\. Firstly, they take refugees to the police station for trivial reasons\. Then they send these people to the provinces of Turkey close to the border\. When they go to these provinces, they make them sign a letter stating that they want to return to Syria voluntarily\. It is illegal to keep Sofia in detention\. It is also illegal to send Sofia to the border\.” 





> The Aman Project, an LGBTQI organisation supporting Sofia, says, “As a transgender or genderfluid person, Sofia is in constant danger of violence in a male prison, and even more so if she is deported back to Syria\. In 2019 a trans refugee from our community was forced over the border, and fell into the hands of a militia group, and has not been heard of since\.” 





> Tess Berry\-Hart, of UK refugee group Calais Action, says, “The international community must act immediately to highlight Sofia’s case and prevent her from being illegally deported and harmed\. Vulnerable LGBTQI refugees are in danger from many different sources and international NGOs must do more to protect them\.” 





> Sofia is currently awaiting transfer to a Turkish border region this week\. Speaking through a translator, she said that other detainees had reported that they had experienced physical intimidation until they signed the voluntary return papers\. Sofia does not want to sign a voluntary return but she fears being beaten because of pre\-existing facial injuries stemming from abuse in Syria\. 





> The Aman Project says, “A human life is literally at risk here, just like in 2019\. We call on the international media to help highlight Sofia’s case, and prevent all refugees being illegally forced back to a war zone\.” 




### ITALY
#### Italy releases MSF’s Geo Barents after nearly a month of detention

Italian authorities released MSF’s search and rescue vessel, the Geo Barents, following 25 days of detention in the Sicilian port of Augusta\. Italy had justified the seizure due to “technical irregularities” with the ship, although MSF insists that the move was politically motivated\.

In a video released by [MSF UK](https://twitter.com/MSF_uk/status/1422912957059633155) , Leo Southall, a deputy search and rescue team leader for the Geo Barents, said that the crew is “relieved” it can finally return to sea to continue its rescue work\.

“The fact that rescue at sea has become a political struggle, the fact that we need to be having this kind of discussion again and again about the legal, but most of all, the moral obligation to assist people in distress is a disgrace to humanity,” Southall said in the video\.
#### Landing in Lampedusa

Seventy\-one people landed on Lampedusa on Wednesday, including 16 women and five unaccompanied minors, [Italian media reported](https://www.agrigentonotizie.it/cronaca/navi-quarantena-immigrazione-lampedusa.html?fbclid=IwAR24VlWzIMB2wrbhNv5y--SIUltA2Vo4cYrmu7u1VYCNqeeiipulO0WV7iI) \. There are currently some 1,200 people on Lampedusa, whose facilities normally can only accommodate a maximum of 250 people\. Several dozen people have been transferred to two quarantine ships to ease the strain on the island\.

Amidst the influx of arrivals, Italy is [calling for the redistribution of people](https://www.stol.it/artikel/politik/fluechtlinge-italien-fordert-von-eu-umverteilung?fbclid=IwAR30-q1KB5rWpH1yf8a0DN903Vqe41AWTGXBqNrGdoWUXu1IY3g6m6xp6sc) to other EU states\. The Italian interior minister Luciana Lamorgese had a phone call on Wednesday with EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson and asked for support to relocate some people outside Italy\.
#### Official charges against Italian couple in Trieste

Photo: [borderline europe](https://www.facebook.com/nonationtruck/posts/549934566420613)

Official charges were announced by the Italian prosecutor’s office against an elderly Italian couple in Trieste who provide aid to people on the move arriving in the border city from Balkan countries\. The so\-called ‘Balkan route’ runs from Greece through the Western Balkans and ends in Trieste on the Slovenian border\.

AYS has reported before on the ridiculous accusations being brought against Gian Andrea Franchi, 84, and Lorena Fornasir, 68, who regularly provide medical aid and non\-food items to people in a park in central Trieste\. People on the move arrive in Trieste sometimes after two weeks of walking from Bosnia and are often in terrible physical condition\.

Now, for their work helping these people, Franchi and Fornasir are being charged with “aiding illegal immigration” and membership in a “criminal organization”, both of which are preposterous\. In February of this year, the couple’s house was raided in the early hours of the morning by Italian authorities searching for information about the volunteer association, Linnea d’Ombra, which the couple founded\.

Borderline Europe [wrote](https://www.facebook.com/nonationtruck/posts/549934566420613) about the charges:


> The charge is just another grotesque case of criminalization of solidarity with those seeking protection and is completely contradictory to the humanitarian and solidarity work they both do in the border city of Trieste to help people who risk their lives 





> We condemn the repressive action of the Italian state and stand in solidarity with those affected\. We demand that charges against Gian Andrea Franchi and Lorena Fornasir be dropped\!

### GREECE
#### Fire evacuation of Amygdaleza detention center cancelled

Amidst raging forest fires surrounding the Greek capital, the planned evacuation of the Amygdaleza detention center was [cancelled](https://www.facebook.com/solidaritymigrants/posts/357943989161470) last night\. Only a few children were transferred in the end\.

While the fire is under control in that area, people at the detention center continue to breathe smoke\-filled air and lack air conditioning and cold water as temperatures soar\.

“The Greek state doesn’t want to give them any hope that they can get out of the detention center, while creating unbearable living conditions in these prisons,” one Facebook post read\. “When it doesn’t kill migrants at the border and does not make \(illegal\) push backs\. When Greek employers don’t exploit migrants in the fields and in other jobs\.”
#### Calls for release of 19 people from Kos pre\-removal detention center

The Greek Ombudsman is [calling for the release](https://equal-rights.org/en/news/greek-ombudsman-calls-for-release-of-19-persons-who-are-unlawfully-detained-in-the-pre-removal-detention-centre-on-kos/?fbclid=IwAR2f-0J4MIq6KuNgt7y23nCrdimW6AmYKVHsof_QysID2NVjOyaSmA1D0kY) of 19 people from the pre\-removal detention center on Kos\. The hotspot island hosts the last such detention center on the Aegean islands\.

The Ombudsman determined that the detention of these people is without any legal basis and is therefore unlawful, calling for their release\. On 30 July the Greek Ombudsman issued an opinion requesting that the authorities “reconsider the decision of administrative detention” in all 19 cases\.

Read the full press release from Equal Rights Beyond Borders [here](https://equal-rights.org/site/assets/files/1304/210804_press_release_kos_ombudsman-2.pdf) , and the decision of the Ombudsman \(in Greek\), [here](https://equal-rights.org/site/assets/files/1304/210730_ombudsman_detention_kos-anonym.pdf) \.
#### Samos camp will open in September

The new prison, or ‘camp’, on the island of Samos is slated to open in September\.

MSF released a [short video](https://twitter.com/MSF_Sea/status/1422822524405141505) about the new camp, saying that the EU “must end the containment policies and provide safety and dignified conditions for asylum seekers now\!”

“I am already in a prison and I will be moved to another one\. I am not doing well, how will I be able to survive in the new camp?” says Ali in the video; he lives in Samos’ Vathy camp\.

#### Bulgaria says “migration pressure” on its borders is increasing

The current Bulgarian Interior Minister warned Parliament recently that “migration pressure” on the country is increasing, according to [bordermonitoring\.eu](https://bulgaria.bordermonitoring.eu/2021/08/03/bulgarian-ministry-of-interior-states-that-migrant-pressure-is-increasing/?fbclid=IwAR2psU_O63X-0qBQhhx2D13lLhUVqGqC9vXO20MO9Lfm__L57S7KHWGHxBc) \.

The MoI stated that 17,621 people have tried to enter Bulgaria since the start of 2021\. Month by month, the numbers are increasing: in May, 2,500 attempts were made, and in June, 4,504\. Police patrol regularly on the borders with Greece and Turkey to try and prevent people from entering Bulgaria\.

#### Vaccinations for asylum\-seekers and refugees

The French government has called on regional police prefects and health officials to speed up the COVID\-19 vaccination of asylum seekers and refugees in time to reach its set goal for the end of August, [reported the media](https://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20210803-french-government-to-speed-up-vaccination-of-asylum-seekers-and-refugees-covid19-migrants-health?fbclid=IwAR2Hc1HFW_mJGjcqgdmIMpsLMi1yd7GpH7Sv5NnjiP6LlcYX9NfdoR-M03U) \. To do so, local authorities have been asked to set up mobile vaccination clinics to better access people who may want vaccines\.
#### EU / FRONTEX
#### EU Commission to “strengthen the capacities” of the Western Balkan countries in dealing with migration

An “IPA\-project” \(pre\-EU accession aid\) by the European Commission [will aim to](http://strengthening the capacities of the Western Balkans on migration management in line with EU standards, including in the area of migration data) “strength\[en\] the capacities of the Western Balkans on migration management in line with EU standards, including in the area of migration data\.”

Western Balkan nations not part of the EU cannot access or store data in the Eurodac system before becoming an Member State; however, as candidate countries, the European Commission says they must “align \[their\] legal, operational and technical systems to be eventually able to connect to Eurodac upon accession to the EU\.”

This “IPA\-project” will train migration authorities outside the EU to “collect, process and handle their migration statistics in a harmonised way” in compliance with EU standards\.

Diane Abbott, a member of the UK Parliament for the Labour Party, wrote about visiting the detention centre in Dover\. “The facility was terrible\. There were 56 people crammed into a small room, including women, young children and babies\. They were sitting or lying on thin mattresses which covered the entire floor, including the aisles between a small number of seats\. At night they would sleep on these same mattresses,” she writes\.
