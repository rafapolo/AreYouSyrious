SYRIA
#### Government demolishes houses and denies property rights of refugees

While international powers and the Syrian government are publishing statements on the safety of the country to convince those who left the country to return home, the same government is denying property rights and access to residential areas in different areas of the country, HRW [report](https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/10/16/syria-residents-blocked-returning) s\.

In some cases, the government has already started to demolish entire residential complexes, especially in areas recently retaken from opposition groups\.

AFGHANISTAN
#### Report on child returnees from Save the Children

Save the Children has released a [report](https://campaigns.savethechildren.net/country/afghanistan) about the situation for children returned to Afghanistan from EU, highlighting the lack of protection they receive and the extreme danger they are placed in\. The report concluded that “Children returning to Afghanistan face difficulties in accessing reliable shelter, education, jobs and medical support, and risk recruitment to armed groups and physical harm due to conflict\. Child returnees face psychosocial and in some cases legal challenges, which render reintegration improbable and pose fundamental challenges to their wellbeing\. Currently, returns to Afghanistan cannot be considered durable\.”

They have started a campaign to end this practice and there is an active petition [here](https://aktion.savethechildren.de/?_ga=2.213298324.160257180.1539718094-1551635214.1539718094) \.

TURKEY
#### 22 people die in a truck accident near Izmir

According to media [sources](http://www.milliyet.com.tr/umuda-yolculuk-ta-9-5-ayda-123-kisi--yerelhaber-3094104/) , from the beginning of the year, 123 refugees have died trying to reach Greece\. Of those deaths, 82 have been by drowning and 41 by traffic accidents on land\. 229 persons were injured in these accidents\. In comparison, 51 people died by drowning in 2017\.

As you can see, all hotspots apart from the one on Leros are still dangerously over capacity\. The Immigration Minister, Dimitris Vitsas, [recently declared](https://www.lesvosnews.net/articles/news-categories/politiki/vitsas-de-tha-dimioyrgithoyn-nea-kentra-ypodohis-prosfygon-sta) that the only hotspot planned for closure, with the building of a replacement centre, is Samos\. Decongestion on the islands will instead rely on the accelerated asylum process, which should only take 90 days

**Cargo ship rescues 18 people between Malta and Lampedusa**

Following yesterday’s report, the cargo ship Just Fitz rescued the 18 people in a dinghy on the night between Monday and Tuesday\. The most recent info stated that the ship was 34 miles south of Lampedusa\. Minister Salvini already commented that the responsibility for the rescue falls on Malta\. Is this the beginning of an other passing\-the\-buck game over people’s lives?

**Updates from Riace**

The house arrest of Mimmo Lucano, mayor of Riace, has been lifted, but the court decided to enact a prohibition against him residing in the town, de facto removing him from his mayoral role\.

In Grande\-Synthe, there are more than a thousand people and while the city hall and the sub\-Prefecture have just signed a protocol providing “shelter” for the exiles during winter, there are likely only 200 places in a building, as well as a few apartments for families\.

SWEDEN
#### 6\-year\-old child faces deportation\.

The Swedish migration centre has decided to deport a 6\-year\-old back to Ukraine, local media sources [report](https://www.expressen.se/nyheter/mamman-dog-nu-ska-sexarige-denis-utvisas/) \.

Denis faces deportation several months after his mother’s death, in the spring\. She had applied for asylum and residency, but since a child’s asylum status is based on their parents, the case has now been closed\.

Denis’ grandparents, who have been living in Sweden for six years, said that they want to adopt him\. But despite this the Migration Agency decided to send him back to Ukraine, “in regard with what’s best for the child\.”

UK
#### \#Lifttheban campaign for the right to work of asylum seekers

In the coming days, Parliament will decide over the new counterterrorism bill, that “excessively restricts freedom of expression, freedom of movement, and privacy” \(read more [here](https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/10/15/uk-amend-flawed-counterterrorism-bill) \) \. Meanwhile, asylum seekers in the country are still banned from working and forced to live on an allowance of 5\.39£ per day\. On Tuesday, 88 organisations launched a campaign to \#lifttheban and allow asylum seekers to work\.

You can read the full report [here](https://y9w4d3a4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/LiftTheBanReport-Singles.pdf) or [sign the petition](https://act.helprefugees.org/help-refugees/lift-the-ban/lift-the-ban/en/) directed to the Home Secretary\.

Moreover, the government of Nauru forbids doctors from photographing their patients “in order to prevent leaks to the media and refugee advocates”\.
