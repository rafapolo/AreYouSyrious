#### FEATURE
#### Frontex— The ETIAS Regulation

Amanda Musco Ekland, a PhD researcher and lecturer, focuses on the automation of EU external border control from a rule of law perspective, and is a legal consultant for the NGO Front\-LEX\. [She has written a piece looking into the legal challenges to FRONTEX’s soon\-to\-be\-implemented European Travel Information and Authorisation System \(ETIAS\)](https://verfassungsblog.de/frontex-and-algorithmic-discretion-part-i/?fbclid=IwAR21TAhkwGnEIkqWWsm-IOGW8SFAs4aQywRFxJ7qTHSyiqlZoNy4E9fx5P0) \.


> I argue that the ETIAS screening rules algorithm illustrates how automation can lead to what I suggest is a new form of arbitrariness — which I refer to as ‘algorithmic discretion’\. This can be defined as a situation where the exercise of power and discretion and their limitations are not sufficiently specified at the legislative level but are delegated to an algorithm instead\. 





**How will ETIAS work?**

ETIAS will use personal data and an algorithm to assess the risk posed by visa\-exempt third\-country nationals entering European territory\.

Personal data is defined as:


> their sex, date, place and country of birth, nationality, city and country of residence, level of education and current occupation 





The algorithm will then assess any risk in the form of; security, irregular migration or epidemic\. It is the Commission that will establish the risk regulation that determines and specifies what would be considered, for instance, a security risk\. It will combine personal information and risk level to then profile an individual and determine whether they are considered a risk\. It will cross\-check with data from Europol, Interpol, and its own ETIAS database\.

**However, the way in which the ETIAS regulation will work in reality will rely quite heavily on the discretion of FRONTEX\.**


> the Regulation merely requires that the specific risk indicators are 1\) based on the Commission’s risk specification, 2\) consist of a combination of certain data categories and 3\) are targeted, proportionate and non\-discriminatory\. 





It works as an automated mechanism and therefore uses very little to no human interference\. The concept of an automated mechanism, as Ekland argues, is not necessarily a bad thing but rather there are legal systems in place to structure human decision\-making, whereas this is not yet completely established in terms of AI\. This is especially concerning if the element of human interference is driven by FRONTEX decision\-making\.

With legal complications and ‘arbitrariness’, comes difficulties in accountability\. Legality and accountability have a relatively straightforward relationship, however, in this instance, the imposition of power and discretion have not been legally clarified\. This responsibility has been placed onto the algorithm, that does not necessarily meet the standard of transparency, accountability, nor legality\.

#### GENERAL
### Press Release by the the Association des Mères de Migrants Disparus

In their statement, [they criticise the statement made by the special envoy of UNHCR](https://alarmphone.org/en/2022/09/11/press-release-by-association-des-meres-de-migrants-disparus/) , where he stated the deaths of individuals trying to cross the Mediterranean [were partly the responsibility of the mothers who allowed them to leave in the first place](ays-news-digest-10-09-22-joint-statement-from-ngos-to-eu-member-states-in-opposition-to-the-96946c11fc8a) \.

They firstly place a great deal of responsibility on countries, such as Tunisia, that have not protected and done enough for their children who have tried to go through such countries with the aim of reaching Europe\.


> Secondly, we blame the policy of the European Union, which is considered racist, for imposing visas on us and closing the borders in the face of our children, while the EU citizens go to our countries without any problems or queues to take visas — an identity card being sufficient to enter\. Furthermore, their governments are colluding with ours to undermine and exploit our wealth, and in consequence, we have been deprived of development projects that could have created opportunities and jobs for our youth\. 





> Therefore, we call for more caution and consideration of the feelings of mothers before making statements that are not appropriate, and even the apology we saw, we did not feel its sincerity but only received it as a formal reply\. 




### PRO ASYL and 60 NGOs sign a letter warning against an EU regulation that would undermine European Asylum Law

This regulation, [proposed in December 2021](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0890&from=EN) , would allow EU states to [deviate from their obligations under European Asylum Law](https://www.proasyl.de/pressemitteilung/frontalangriff-auf-das-europaeische-asylrecht/?fbclid=IwAR0GmCaDycN0LO4KS5BpztktkrGR4g3q_MJpTMGIW4rfxg2PB5zyAimIc5o) in specific circumstances within the context of migration and asylum\.


> “For years we have been observing an erosion of the right to asylum and the rule of law at Europe’s external borders\. But with this regulation, shabby practices of breaking the law would be cast in law\. That means a free pass for repressive governments in the EU that trample on the rights of those seeking protection,” — Karl Kopp, Head of Europe Department of PRO ASYL\.

#### CROATIA
### A train collision last Friday left 12 injured, including an Iranian family

The family members were separated, with 5 being taken to a hospital in Nova Gradiska, and the other 3 members were taken to a hospital in Slavonski Brod\.

They weren’t sure whether their family members had survived until the Saturday afternoon when other family members spoke to journalists outside of the Nova Gradiska hospital\.

The family had previously been informed by the Croatian authorities that they were to return to Iran\. However, as two of the passengers were minors, and were taken to hospital without any adults present, the authorities considered them to be unaccompanied minors\. They were taken to a social care centre, and are now in foster families\.

### 49\-year old male arrested on suspicion of human smuggling

The Croatian authorities suspect he was smuggling a group of Indian nationals, [charging them roughly 1000 euros](https://dnevnik.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/na-granici-sa-srbijom-ulovljen-svercer-koji-je-prevozio-ilegalne-migrante---741614.html?utm_campaign=ughr.contentexchange.me&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=ughr.contentexchange.me&fbclid=IwAR2zIvy8OkGoRwzTMiBEnxM44L9_oY_xjyJ18uoDSKU0k9skwyJfWWKX3ks) \.

The group were found in a compartment with no air vents, windows or safety belts, and were therefore exposed to inhumane conditions\.
