Feature story
#### Feature Story: People are returned to Libya faster than they are evacuated

Yesterday, 211 people arrived in Europe via humanitarian corridors \(In Italy and Norway\) \. This is good news, but it is far from being enough\. To set the record straight, it is important to remind everyone that ‚Äî according to MSF data ‚Äî f [or every 100 people evacuated, 250 are instead returned to Libya](https://twitter.com/sallyhayd/status/1134481772941586432?fbclid=IwAR3oR8M6iRnXzPoxtFfH2ra42fhgAKb5s1wXrW8JJybOYOJCsy2ZZHD3QNc) \. Something is evidently not working:

"Libya‚Äôs coast guard is intercepting refugees &amp; migrants &amp; returning them to detention faster than the agency can evacuate them out of the country."
So has UNHCR asked the EU to lift restrictions on search-and-rescue NGOs and to halt support for the Libyan coastguard? https://t.co/kx1rjGiaui

TUNISIA

[UNHCR has visited the Tunisian border area with Libya](https://twitter.com/cochetel/status/1134456403115094017https://twitter.com/cochetel/status/1134456403115094017) , to assess the situation and prepare the ground for the expected increase of people fleeing Libya due to the armed conflicts\.

SEA

Mediterranean Hope [inform](https://www.mediterraneanhope.com/2019/05/31/8113/) that over 600 people attempted to leave the Libyan coasts in the last week\. Thanks to the support given by European countries to the Libyan coast guard, large numbers of these people were forcibly returned to the horrifying conditions in detention centres in the north African country\.

GREECE
#### Arrivals

[MoChara report](https://www.facebook.com/RefugeeRescueUK/posts/2242177539183017?hc_location=ufi) that they brought 14 people to safety at Skala Sikamneas last night after finding an inflatable boat while on a training exercise\. The 14 people \(3 men, 4 women, 7 children\) from Afghanistan were brought to the transit camp, where they received blankets, clothes, and tea as well as food\.

Two boats have arrived on Lesvos since yesterday: 45 people\.

[Aegean Boat Report](https://www.facebook.com/AegeanBoatReport/posts/583946815461760?hc_location=ufi) also recorded another landing on Lesvos which was picked up by HCG outside Agrilia Kratigou, Lesvos south 02\.00, carrying 31 people\. No breakdown available\.

[Samos Volunteers report](https://twitter.com/samosvolunteers/status/1134391722077802496?fbclid=IwAR2gZl0NRLXaygpWcS9zxjq3AAZfFFjewHI10HRKe2GRHPmZ8mKtDC31OLY) that 207 new asylum seekers have arrived on the island this week from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Iran and other countries\.

#### Cinema Project at Katsikas

People living in Katsikas Camp are fundraising for a projector so that they can start their own cinema\. Mohammed, who will be running the project says:


> The life on the camp \(or prison life\) is everyone waiting, no jobs, no work to do, it‚Äôs boring and sad\. So a cinema inside the camp would be a good idea for children and adults\. Everyone can be involved\. I want to show children‚Äôs movies, educational and schooling programs\. For adults I think comedy movies from each others countries and documentary programs that can help us learn\. 





To donate contact paul@refugeesupport\.eu\. The projector costs ¬£400 and they have so far raised ¬£299\!

ITALY

In May, 300 people arrived on Lampedusa, Italy\. This accounts for more than half of the total of arrivals on the island in 2019\.

As Mediterranean Hopes [explains](https://www.mediterraneanhope.com/2019/05/31/8113/) it:


> As we have always stated, data show that the real pull factor \[‚Ä¶\] is not the presence of NGOs in the Mediterranean, but the good weather\. 





Those rescued yesterday by the Italian Navy will arrive on Saturday morning in Genoa, on the northernmost shore of country\.

We can‚Äôt help but wonder, along with Mediterranea ‚Äî Saving Humans, why the ministry assigned the farthest port to disembark people who have already been stranded at sea for days\. It is just cruel\.

BOSNIA

GERMANY

A broad alliance of lawyers and judges associations, along with NGOs working for children‚Äôs rights, welfare and human rights, is calling on the members of the German parliament in an [open letter](https://www.der-paritaetische.de/fachinfos/geordnete-rueckkehr-gesetz-nicht-verabschieden-22-zivilgesellschaftliche-organisationen-schreiben-of/?fbclid=IwAR2CycgOQxUWKSz4xK0KGjYOUzfPPGcFEJYIA_6QmUWCUvTceAcDem-TmK4) , to stop the ‚ÄúGeordnete\-R√ºckkehr\-Gesetz‚Äù, a law which ‚Äî among other things ‚Äî would facilitate deportations\.

The organisations stated that the proposed law aims at exclusion of migrants and violates fundamental and human rights\. In particular, the planned extension of the terms of pre\-deportation detention, the cuts of asylum\-seeker benefits below the subsistence level and the introduction of a new precarious status are unacceptable and will have a dramatic impact on those affected\.

German media also [report](https://www.dw.com/de/bamf-lehnt-viele-antr%C3%A4ge-auf-familiennachzug-ab/a-48988345?fbclid=IwAR3KS0GlCemzPJ6aDQCNsTu2BmukzioBPa1uLrudRQzocG1D_sTh5SZbfwE) that, according to a government response to a parliamentary question from Die Linke party, between January and May 2019, the German asylum authority BAMF has rejected 472 of the 626 applications for family reunification filed in Greece\. This accounts for 75% of the total\.

FRANCE

The organisation [Le Mouvement ETIC](https://www.facebook.com/MouvementETIC/) is organising a [debate on asylum and immigration at the National Assembly in Paris](https://www.eventbrite.fr/e/billets-debat-a-lassemblee-nationale-asile-et-immigration-62426581586?utm-medium=discovery&utm-campaign=social&utm-content=attendeeshare&aff=escb&utm-source=cp&utm-term=listing&fbclid=IwAR03qqXum8EiP29SyI_3uoJheKb4DeuAd9Mj4T4uTSTFFZFAWi01Hv-5wAY) for June 17th\. Among other associations, the [Timmy ‚Äî Soutien aux Mineurs Exil√©s](https://www.facebook.com/TimmySoutienAuxMineursExiles/?__tn__=%2CdK-R-R&eid=ARC8KBg3zzZ2bq7guDTkNGLpOGrEk1vdRsCIpgOwfHZKpBeL6XBrjz-z3UDHQbejbCgMiFqvr2MfqsMh&fref=tag&hc_location=group) has been invited to testify on the situation of exiled minors\.

DENMARK

Following up on the case of Zarmina Waziri, elderly woman affected by dementia who is fighting to remain in Denmark since 2017, Afghanistan authorities stated that they would refuse to accept her if Denmark attempts to deport her\.

As [Welcome to Denmark](https://www.facebook.com/welcome2dk/photos/a.1471269049868616/2262684617393718/?type=3&theater) puts it, ‚Äúit is in itself grotesque that Afghanistan should lecture Denmark on how to treat sick people humane\. But the reaction of Ingers St√∏jbers ‚Äî Danish migration minister ‚Äî to Afghan authorities‚Äô statement is even more grotesque: she said that Afghanistan is obliged to accept Zarmina because Denmark provides aid to the country and she threatens almost directly to withhold it if Afghanistan does not play its part in this inhumane, risky and potentially deadly treatment of Zarmina‚Äù\.
