This resulted in the interim measure request being granted\. 
ECHR notified the Greek state to tell them they are obliged to give shelter and food to the people\.

### EP blocks Frontex

A majority of lawmakers sitting on the budget control committee [voted](https://euobserver.com/migration/154639?fbclid=IwAR0rIiAYgoBfxVNvJqZWRJwPC4W4fAF0yyoHeFTgQ4nCgbLx0p5NO7S5qlk) on Thursday \(31 March\) to postpone Frontex‚Äôs discharge, a measure used by the European Parliament to hold EU institutions and agencies to account\. Aside from Frontex, all other EU agencies had their books cleared by the committee\.

They cited, as reasons behind the decision, a failure to fulfil the conditions set out in the Parliament‚Äôs [previous discharge report](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20210923IPR13401/ep-committee-asks-for-part-of-frontex-budget-to-be-frozen) , as well as findings by the EU‚Äôs Anti\-Fraud watchdog regarding harassment, misconduct and migrant pushbacks involving the Agency, presented to the committee by the OLAF Director\-General and judged by the Members to be serious enough to postpone the discharge\. Reported violations in Greece were not addressed and the operations in Hungary were continued regardless of the ruling by the Court of Justice that refugee return operations in Hungary in 2020 were incompatible with EU law, they [say](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220328IPR26301/meps-withhold-discharge-of-eu-border-control-agency-frontex-accounts) \._ 




#### GREECE

The updated report on the situation of beneficiaries of international protection in Greece, published today by [RSA](https://rsaegean.org/en/beneficiaries-of-international-protection-in-greece-report/?fbclid=IwAR2fiMO6_4x0gfiuuRQl54dAgYLdddOZzatw1d_i3Hjs5eUHGQBL-u7bDhc) and Stiftung PRO ASYL, highlights chronic legal and practical barriers excluding them from the basic documents and socio\-economic rights needed to rebuild their lives\.

Seven cases of refugees granted status by Greece and readmitted thereto by other European Union countries in the last two years illustrate the particular impact of these systemic obstacles on people returned to Greece\.

#### ITALY
### Special protection accepted by the Court of Turin, in favor of a Senegalese citizen applicant

The court concluded, among other things, that ‚Äúproceeding with the comparative assessment between the integration situation that the applicant has in Italy and that which he experienced before departure and in which he would live in case of return, there is an effective and unbridgeable disproportion between the two contexts of life in the enjoyment of fundamental rights which are an indispensable prerequisite for a dignified life‚Äù\.

#### GERMANY
### Asylum in Germany for those saved at sea

From the summer of 2018 until the end of 2021, **only five people** rescued by German sea rescue NGOs in the Mediterranean have **received a protection** status in Germany\.

No April joke: According to a response published the day before yesterday by the federal government to a request from the AfD, in the period from August 1 2018 to December 31 2021 there were **5,773 people** who now reside in Germany and who were **rescued in the Mediterranean** by German SAR NGOs\. However, systematic statistical lifts are not carried out by the federal government, ‚Äúso that the fullness, resilience and final validity cannot be judged‚Äù\.

Of the people saved by these organizations in the abovementioned period and transferred to Germany, **155** have applied for asylum in the Federal Republic, but **only five of them have received a protection status** \. One person was granted asylum according to Article 16a of the basic law, another person refugee protection under ¬ß3 of the Asylum Act, and three other persons subsidized protection under ¬ß4 of the Asylum Act\.
#### FRANCE
### Mailbox for justice and the end of illegal evictions

Mailboxes have been set up in informal living areas in Calais\. From now on, the authorities will be obliged to respect the rule of law\. With the mailboxes, people cannot be evicted because French law protects ‚Äúhomes‚Äù

They were able to install mailboxes on the property, allowing people to register and receive mail and preventing them from expulsion\.

A new organisation, Mosa√Øc Calais, was set up to provide a cultural space and recreation to displaced people in the area

However, at the same time, new evictions were reported in the Dunkirk area, leaving more than 300 people outside under the rain with no shelter, Utopia 56 teams reported\.

The municipality of Calais has warmly welcomed hundreds of Ukrainian people and provided them with accommodation\. On the other hand, 1,500 Afghan, Ethiopian, Eritrean, Iraqi and Syrian people are still in Calais with the same request for protection but do not benefit from the same treatment\. The latter are stranded along the Franco\-British border in adverse weather conditions, living in damp sheds or tents\.

> He is young in his twenties\. I will call him Matthew\. 





> Do you remember the protest in Miedniki? What I‚Äôm going to talk about started there March 2nd\. Although the wounds on Matthew‚Äôs body appeared the day before yesterday\. 





> Refugees then organized a protest in which Matthew was not involved\. Four officers entered his room this morning\. One of the men kicked him in the leg\. Matthew fell to the floor along with his chair\. When he raised his head, the man pushed it to the floor with his shoe and said something, pointing at the gun\. 





> Two minutes, no more\. They‚Äôre out\. They went to the next room\. 





> Two minutes\. Or rather 8 months and two minutes, because that‚Äôs how much Matthew spent in a closed resort in Lithuania\. Refugees trapped for months, bursting\. Almost every day I get a picture of someone broken\. Someone‚Äôs friends forcefully pulled a knife out of his hand because he shaved himself\. A farewell letter\. Message: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt sleep, I have to make sure my friend doesn‚Äôt kill herself\.‚Äù And Mateusz and his younger colleague broke up in such a way that they decided to run away\. 





> They ran into the night\. They run into the woods\. They say it‚Äôs been an hour somewhere when they lay on their stomachs to check on the map exactly where they are\. They made sure no one noticed the phone light\. 





> Security guards showed up out of nowhere\. Their dog was the first to throw himself on the back of an eighteen\-year\-old\. At that time, the officer gave Matthew pepper gas in the eyes\. The dog then started biting Matthew\. Too bad I won‚Äôt show photos of these mornings\. I‚Äôm looking at them by myself, winking to protect myself from this view\. The bodyguard said : ‚ÄúBravo\! Well done\! ‚Äú 





> There were five of them guardians\. Four men, one woman\. And there goes this dog\. 





> Matthew doesn‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because of gas or because of further bites, he‚Äôs unconscious\. When he pooped, the officer held him by his neck, telling him to get up and go\. 





> They went to the building where the ambulance was already waiting\. The nurse, when she saw the wounds of the migrants, turned to the guard and asked, ‚ÄúWhat did you do to them?‚Äù She laughed\. And they laughed \. 





> The ambulance driver, an older man, brought water to Matthew\. ‚ÄúAs my only sympathy‚Äù ‚Äî the story\. 





> When it became clear that they had to take him to the hospital, Matthew asked to see his friend\. ‚ÄúHe only turned 18 a month ago\. He‚Äôs in a poor mental state, crying a lot‚Äù\. He heard: ‚ÄúCalm down, we are not going to rape him\.‚Äù 





> At the hospital he got an anemia shot\. He asked for water ‚Äî he didn‚Äôt get it\. He wanted to go to the location ‚Äî they weren‚Äôt allowed him\. He asked for a release ‚Äî they only gave him a registration number as a souvenir of the event\. 





> He returned to the guard around 6am\. A mate was there too, frozen\. They asked for a blanket\. They didn‚Äôt get it\. There was water in the faucet, they could have drank\. ‚ÄúAfter four hours, three uniforms came to us, who beat us\. I remember their faces, I can describe them\. I have them in front of my eyes all the time,‚Äù he says\. 





> Finally, they were taken back to the resort in Medniki Krolewski\. It‚Äôs been taken apart\. It has been searched\. Took money and power banks\. 





> Matthew‚Äôs leg hurt more and more\. 





> The ambulance was called again\. He didn‚Äôt have the strength to reach her\. His colleagues helped him\. Did he get anesthesia, or maybe some calming pills? Sam doesn‚Äôt know what they gave us\. 





> The officer said, ‚ÄúThis is what happens when you escape the camp\.‚Äù 





She concludes her report by saying: ‚ÄúI have more reports of both boys including their mates\. I have videos and pictures to upload\. So scary, so drastic\. Full of violence and helplessness\.‚Äù

The court ruling that deportations of refugees are inhumane and illegal did not make any impression on the Polish border guards\. For the third time, they pushed two Kurdish families with seven children over the border wire\.

### New rule as another instrument of the so\-called discriminatory legalism

There is a new proposed rule that promotes more transparency of the funding of Polish NGOs, supposedly in response to claims that NGOs are leveraged by Russia, but these actions are often quickly wielded against NGOs who simply do not toe the political line \(including refugee support NGOs\) \.

The dean of the Faculty of Law at the SWPS University in Warsaw also explained why the Solidarity Poland project was negative: ‚ÄúThe bad thing about this law is that it will not serve the purposes for which it is allegedly created, but will serve to threaten, repress and discriminate against those organizations that are undesirable, those that act contrary to the political interest\.‚Äù

Polish police are treating these volunteers as criminals for providing aid.

### Does the threat of terrorism justify migration restrictions?

An [analysis](https://verfassungsblog.de/os5-migration-restrictions/?fbclid=IwAR1kpgW9HbibHkeJEEQUAJKyPbWqOmlEL3rzqpCJuRC4Vii9eu1SGVMnyxU) of European data from 1980 to 2004 concludes that increased immigration does not result in increased terrorism rates caused by the immigrants themselves, but does lead to an increase in terrorism by domestic right\-wing terrorists hostile to migrants\.

If this last finding is sound, it suggests a pathway by which immigration does indeed significantly increase terrorism\. But it would be perverse to restrict migration for the purpose of limiting terrorist attacks generated by right\-wing nativists\. It would also set a dangerous precedent\.

- does it make sense to compare the arrival of more than a million people at Europe‚Äôs southern borders in 2015, with the arrival of more than 4 million people across borders between Eastern European countries in 2022 \(so far\)? And if so, what are the similarities and differences?
