One of the boys suffered visible leg injures and was observed in an apparent state of distress\. They were not willing to communicate,but after getting involved in some creative activities they showed interest in legal options and accommodation possibilities\.”_

> “Let’s try to give some truth back to the events of the last days\. On the Italian\-French border, people are rejected on a daily basis, and in this period we are talking about 30–40 people a day forced to travel, in any weather condition, 6 kilometers to return to the city of Ventimiglia\.” 






![“For months the solidarity of the territory have been organizing a fixed sit\-in close to the border together with the other solidary people who cross the territory, a safe “port” in the territory of Ventimiglia to guarantee a first support to the rejected people\. Water and food are distributed, as well as other basic necessities, but evidently even this type of support is not contemplated by those who have governed the city for a few months\.” Photo by [Project20K](https://www.facebook.com/progetto20k/posts/891284521231463)](assets/3f93066ba816/1*597mMnyOTQfnnHqq1P383w.jpeg)

According to Human Right’s Watch \(HRW\), a decision was made on Monday which could severely affect the _“escalation in harassment and intimidation of aid workers in France\.”_

An Aid working is having to pay a fine for a tweet he made in response to police activity in Calais\. Find out more [here](https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/06/25/france-aid-workers-defamation-conviction-upheld?fbclid=IwAR3CGDn1gj8hqSYpeVZ_Gp0nCo8JNpxj4-m3g9D0in84KoDWdM0UafnnyJU) \.

### Denmark

[**Denmark**](https://www.berlingske.dk/samfund/her-er-de-seks-syriske-proevesager-dyk-ned-i-afgoerelserne-en-for-en?fbclid=IwAR1DQVzQlWaODXMLizMcA2D4OLah4aodiMizAS8e6Z9TwChdR0ylV4Wz0Fk) **WAS becoming the first country in the West to send people back to Syria\.**

BUT 6 trial cases of Denmark trying to uplifted the protections status and event of sending these people back to Syria has stopped\. The ministry of immigration\- and integration lost, which means that the refugee board in all 6 cases decided that these Syrians will keep their protection status in Denmark\.
Small victory for humane asylum politics\.

In all 6 cases the refugee board stated individually reason for keeping the protection status\. This means we are still lacking to see a principal statement from the board that Syria is not safe for anyone to be deported to\.
