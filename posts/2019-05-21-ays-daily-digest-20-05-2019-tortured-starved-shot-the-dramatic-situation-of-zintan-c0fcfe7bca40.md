### Libya: Tortured, starved, shot — the dramatic situation of Zintan

It is becoming worse and worse\. When new fights erupted in Libya at the end of April, the focus slightly shifted to the situation for people on the run, who are trapped in detention camps\. One of them was in Zintan, some 180 km southwest of Tripolis, where [reportedly](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/04/libya-detained-refugees-shot-clashes-tripoli-continue-190423184222138.html) several people were wounded by gunfire and one was shot\.

The news making the rounds from there in the past several days is even more terrifying\. Human rights lawyer Giulia Tranchina wrote recently that people have been left without food and water for two days and nights:


> 20 have died of TB \[tuberculosis\] and starvation over the last six months\.

They have already staged protests, calling themselves victims of UNHCR Libya, abused by human rights organizations\. Journalist Sally Hayden said: “ I’ve repeatedly been told by detainees in Zintan that the bodies of refugees/migrants who die there are kept on site for long periods of time\.” One of the signs says that they were stored in a refrigerator\.


> Every day now detainees mourn the dead, one Eritrean in Zintan told me\.

It's very hard to get independent confirmation of this, but they want proper funerals for them. #libya https://t.co/jwfEJ4ZFu1

Apparently, this kind of abuse is also physical\. At the UNHCR centre people have reportedly been kicked and hit by new guards, who even shot in the air and forced the people to stay inside\. One minor’s teeth were broking during the abuse, Hayden was told\.

According to its own account, UNHCR [evicted](https://www.unhcr.org/news/press/2019/4/5cc09a824/unhcr-evacuates-hundreds-detained-refugees-libya-safety.html) more than 300 people the past weeks\.
### Montenegro: Dire conditions in Konik camp

Activists have [published](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1157824667713728/permalink/1175010119328516/) footage from a camp in Konik, a suburb of Podgorica\. Reportedly it is a former hotel — with unsanitary conditions\. They speak about “unhealthy, small food portions, racist comments from the employees, the dangerous environment in which the camp is located”\.

As is the case elsewhere, there are local citizens’ initiatives in small groups who have been assisting people who are passing through Montenegro and also those who have been pushed back from Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is a practice that has recently been taking place more and more often\. This practice is supported and financed by the international community, just like pushbacks on the Croatian side that have unsuccessfully been denied by the Croatian Ministry of the Interior\.

AYS is also trying to support these groups in different places, through direct donations or financially, thanks to the help of others, to cover at least some of the basic needs\. One such group in Montenegro is currently collecting funds to cover the expenses at the facility where they welcome people:

### France: Airport occupied

A collective of undocumented people has reportedly occupied Charles De Gaulle Airport\. They demand that Air France “stop any financial, logistical or political participation in deportations”\. Some 500 people are said to have participated in this action\. A full statement can be found [here](https://detainedvoices.com/2019/05/21/les-gilets-noirs-we-are-in-the-airport-in-france/) \.

### Greece: Still a destination country for Turkish people

Greece remains a destination for Turkish people fleeing their home country\. Almost 1,700 Turkish people have asked for asylum in Greece this year, more than 8,000 since the coup attempt in 2016\.
