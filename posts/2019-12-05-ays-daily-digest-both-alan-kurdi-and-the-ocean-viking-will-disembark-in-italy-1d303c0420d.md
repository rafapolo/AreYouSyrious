> **“Finally, the news in the night: Safe Port for the ALAN KURDI in Messina\.** It’s over\. After rescuing 84 people from distress and a six\-day\-long stand\-off, our vessel was finally allow to dock in Messina, Italy\. 23 rescued persons had to be evacuated over the past days, among them three infants and twelve people, who collapsed unconscious on board our rescue vessel\. Even though ministers celebrate themselves for their deals, we are everything but satisfied\. Humans are not up for negotiation\. We urgently need a mechanism that allows for a swift and humane disembarkation\.”

> “Relief when Italian maritime authorities informed **the Ocean Viking** late last night that they have assigned Pozzallo to the rescued people on board as a safe place\. The 60 survivors who were rescued on Thursday will go ashore \(Wednesday\) morning\.”

### Afghanistan

In an update from [UNAMA](https://www.facebook.com/pg/UNAMA.News/posts/?ref=page_internal) \(United Nation’s Assistance Mission in Afghanistan\): _“Afghans needing humanitarian aid up from 6\.3 million \(2019\) to 9\.4 million for 2020, a quarter of the population\. UN looking to raise US$732 million for 2020 to help the most vulnerable with emergency support\.”_
### Libya

D’Agostino, a notable journalist, notes that while the thread of the UNHCR spokeperson below does finally share some of the harshest facts about Libya, he adds that _“Instead of advocating for a failing ‘war on smugglers’ \(it doesn’t work, makes people less safe\), what about calling for legal passage for migrants?”_

Very true, but the thread does create a concise picture of the trafficking situation:

Perception with smugglers that they can pay more money for ransoms+smuggling

Smugglers becoming increasingly brutal. Nearly all men tortured, nearly all women raped.  3/5

Also: “ _Smugglers and traffickers are increasingly diversifying their business models\. No longer so reliant on sea crossings\. Also look to make money from refugees through extortion, forced labour, recruitment to armed groups, selling people as slaves, etc\.”_ More [here](https://twitter.com/yaxle/status/1202176633031008256) \.
### Sea

At least 57 people have died in a ship wreck in the Atlantic off the coast of Mauritania on Wednesday\. Seventy\-four people in the same boat were able to stay alive by swimming to shore\. The boat left Gambia on Thursday carrying 150 people\. They were heading toward the Canary Islands, which continue to see an [increasing number of new arrivals](ays-daily-digest-03-12-2019-croatian-police-kidnapped-two-nigerian-students-1e316422ce21) for 2019 compared to the year before\.

### Greece

The government’s plan to build closed camps on the islands might be halted, since European Authorities told the Greek government that they are not willing to fund closed camps:


> “According to [tvxs\.gr](https://tvxs.gr/news/ellada/eyropaiko-stop-sta-kleista-kentra-kratisis) , the Greek government was informed last week by European officials that it is extremely difficult, until impossible to obtain funding for the construction and operation of closed pre\-departure detention centers, as in the two plans submitted by the Greek side to the European Commission for 2020 funding, no such request\. The first plan was drafted by the SYRIZA government and the responsible Minister Dimitris Vitsas and apparently did not contain any such plan for closed\-type detention centers\.”
