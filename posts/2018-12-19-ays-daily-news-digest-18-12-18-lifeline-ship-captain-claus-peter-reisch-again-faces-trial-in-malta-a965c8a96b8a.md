Claus\-Peter Reisch was again on trial on charges of using the Lifeline boat in Maltese waters without proper registration or license and of entering Malta illegaly after the rescue of 234 refugees\. Reisch was finally able to defend himself on Tuesday, stating that he checked the ships certificate which explains that Lifeline owns the vessel, and is marked with a Dutch flag registered in Amsterdam as the home port\.

Reisch further explained that he asked for a port of safety: “This could not be in Libya because there is no port of safety”\.

After the permission to disembark in Mata “w _e were given a berth & the Maltese doctors came onboard\. Nobody from the disembarkation came to check our documents\. We just did a very ordinary check\-in procedure \(…\) the Maltese authorities ordered me to enter the Maltese port\. They organised a berth and prepared it all before\. My only intention was to find a port of safety\. It’s not up to me to chose and I have to follow the instructions without choice”\._

### Border violence in Evros

[Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/12/18/greece-violent-pushbacks-turkey-border?fbclid=IwAR2smEgKsEcW-Eq7t0TVxb1p5OK2W5xDKEpe6cD3P_l2wAwaWfw2qy-7yTw) says Greek law enforcement officers at the land border with Turkey in the northeastern Evros region routinely summarily return asylum seekers and migrants\. The officers in some cases use violence and often confiscate and destroy the migrants’ belongings\. HRW interviewed 26 refugees\. Of those, twelve said police or unidentified forces accompanying the police stripped them of their possessions\. Seven said police or unidentified forces took their clothes or shoes and forced them back to Turkey in their underwear, sometimes at night in freezing temperatures\.
#### Croatia
### Centre for Peace Studies files complaint over illegal pushbacks

The [Centre for Peace Studies](https://www.cms.hr/hr/azil-i-integracijske-politike/medunarodni-dan-migranata-nova-kaznena-prijava-zbog-sumnje-na-nezakonito-postupanje-policijskih-sluzbenika?fbclid=IwAR3eTwMX5ekvOMzg8_s8OxmhEXMm_uKiNT0kxs2EBbfHobNoZVrPWWKOO7s) filed a complaint to the State Attorney, urging them to examine the evidence in the recently documented and widely published case of mass expulsion by the Croatian police\. Border Violence Monitoring had published more than 130 recordings, showing illegal and often violent pushbacks by Croatian police into Bosnian territory\. Asja Korbar from Are You Syrious was a guest at the [regional TV station N1](http://hr.n1info.com/Vijesti/a356232/Asja-Korbar-Vracanje-izbjeglica-iz-Hrvatske-sve-je-nasilnije.html?fbclid=IwAR1qKDX6z4MLkYXMauP8wFaIE_LO07AV-TvoDpe-YG3PQd9-qz4yMQGo5Uw) , speaking about the recent expulsions\. Korbar notes that organisations have warned of illegal and increasingly violent return of refugees from the Croatian territory since 2016 and criticises that the refugees’ cases are not assessed individually, but that they are collectively returned to the territory of another state\.

UNHCR Croatia stated:


> “UNHCR takes allegations of excessive use of force by the police very seriously\. We have shared our concerns with the Croatian authorities and have urged them to investigate all reported cases, and to refrain from the use of force”

A rally took place on Tuesday for the international day of migrants in Paris, to protest against rising nationalism and in memory of all those who died while trying to reach Europe\. Banners were also installed in front of the Red Cross, where minors are being evaluated and often rejected, forcing them to continue living in the streets\.

A demonstration took place in front of the UN, asking for human rights to be respected in deportations centers\. It specifically asked for the closure of the Sjaelsmark deportation center and worries about the well\-being of children and young people in particular, given the lack of edible food, the exposure to the sound of gunfire from the military base nearby, the unhyiegnic conditions and the freezing temperatures\. This demonstration is a follow\-up on the demostrations in front of parliament, the immigration office and the Red Cross that took place of the last 45 days\.
