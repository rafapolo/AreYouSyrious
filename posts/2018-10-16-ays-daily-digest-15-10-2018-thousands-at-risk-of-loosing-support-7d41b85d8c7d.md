### Feature: Thousands in Greece will be left on their own

Since 2015, almost 28,000 people gained refugee status in Greece\. As of now, 52,000 applications are still pending, as [Kathimerini](http://www.ekathimerini.com/233610/article/ekathimerini/news/thousands-of-refugees-will-soon-have-to-pay-their-own-way) writes citing officials’ statements\.

This also means that thousands are in risk of losing support from next year on: “These people will be entitled to the same state assistance as low\-income individuals, meaning welfare and housing and heating benefits\.”

As the Greek economy is still weak and the unemployment rate is high, there is a risk of huge problems incoming, if no solution will be provided soon\.
### Morocco

The Moroccan association for human rights \(AMDH Nador\) reports that the Moroccan auxiliary forces, a paramilitary brigade, attacked camps in the forests of Nador\. However, this information has not yet been verified by AYS\. In the past their reports have been reliable\.

### Sea

More than 88,000 people arrived in Europe by sea this year, as of 12 October\. According to the [IOM](https://reliefweb.int/report/spain/mediterranean-migrant-arrivals-reach-88049-2018-deaths-reach-1783) figures, 40,000 of them arrived in Spain, while almost 400 people died\. 24,500 made it to Greek soil, while 118 did not\. 21,500 came to Italy, while 1260 died\.

This means, that some six percent of the people died while trying to cross the central Mediterranean\.

The number of arrivals was constantly increasing this year, especially in Spain\.


> The IOM notes that over the first five months of this year, a total of 8,150 men, women and children were rescued in Spanish waters after leaving Africa — an average of 54 per day\. In the 132 days since 31 May, a total of 32,448 have arrived — or just under 256 migrants per day\. Arrivals in October are running at a rate of over 300 per day\. 




In the central Mediterranean, one boat with 18 people on board was reported to be in distress off Lampedusa on Monday evening\. It is not known yet if the people survived\.

### Greece

[1976km](https://www.facebook.com/1976km/posts/2351237891773093:0?hc_location=ufi) mentions yet another problem for children living in Moria camp on Lesvos: education\.

Other than the young residents of Kara Tepe, children there are not able to attend public schools\. “Authorities admit that there are simply too many kids in Moria\. The system can’t handle it\. Secondly, due to lack of money, children from Moria haven’t been vaccinated and the rule is simple: no vaccination card = no school\.”

There is a new source for volunteers interested in helping on Chios:

The Chios People’s Warehouse\. “We’re always hard at work focusing on distributions of non\-food items to the 2,300 people living in Vial Refugee Camp,” the volunteers introduced themselves\.

Some more good news arrived from the island: A group of children [was welcomed](https://astraparis.gr/sta-scholeia-tis-chioy-ta-prosfygopoyla-apomonothikan-oi-akraies-fones/) to schools at the island\.

### Italy

After activists of Chez Jesus occupied the square in Claviere and set up a tent to help people in need, the police came to evict the square\. The group refused to leave, despite threats of seizing all materials and ID controls\. After almost four hours they decided to dismantle their tent and leave for France after a couple of van controls\.

### Bosnia

In the first week of October, 1,322 people were registered in Albania, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina by the [IOM](https://reliefweb.int/report/spain/mediterranean-migrant-arrivals-reach-88049-2018-deaths-reach-1783) : “Between January and October 2018, authorities in these countries registered a total of 23,335 irregular migrants\. Researchers say 72 per cent of the migrants were registered in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where since the beginning of the year authorities have reported 16,991 new irregular migrants — 15 times more than the 1,116 registered in the whole of 2017\.”

Chemseddine Berafta, an Algerian citizen, is the first migrant who will officially be registered and allowed to play professional football in Football club Krajisnik in the Bihac region\. He is an asylum seeker and is waiting for the decision on his status, but meanwhile he will start to play\.
