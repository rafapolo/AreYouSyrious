#### FEATURE STORY: Iceland, two more families in risk of deportation to Greece

AYS reported in the last months about the protests against deportations in Iceland\.

Now two families are risking deportation to Greece\. Both families have been granted protection in Greece and arrived autonomously in Iceland in the last 12 months\. The government intend to deport the families, despite the Red Cross has deemed living conditions in Greece unfit for refugees\. The Icelandic Review have [published a long\-read](https://www.icelandreview.com/society/in-focus-asylum-seeker-deportations/) on the case:


> Icelandic authorities have twice denied reviewing the families’ cases\. \[…\] However, a new legal amendment implemented recently by Minister of Justice Þórdís Kolbrún Reykfjörð gives both families some hope\. The amendment requires the Directorate of Immigration to process asylum applications of children, even if they have already gained international protection status in another country, when 10 months have passed from the date the application was received by Icelandic authorities\. 





This new amendment is a resposne to the widespread criticism for Icelandic handling of deportation cases\. One of the children have received widespread support from her fellow students, who collected 6,000 signatures in her favour and organised a march in her support\.


[![Stop deporting children to Greece]( "Stop deporting children to Greece")](https://vimeo.com/346213590)



> Authorities’ handling of the cases has been met with severe backlash from people from all walks of life\. Surveys have repeatedly shown that the majority of Icelanders are in favour of receiving more refugees to the country\. There is mounting pressure on authorities and government to stop the deportations, and to abide by international laws\. UNICEF in Iceland released a statement reminding authorities that the deportations are in violation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Iceland is party to\. Along with this, Red Cross officials have called on the government to rescind the decision to deport the families, as well as the Office of the Ombudsman for Children asking to discuss the matter with authorities\. 





The authorities have commented in favour of the revision of the cases of the two families, but at the same time have — in the last months — drafted a bill which would “weaken the position of asylum seekers such as the Safari and Sarwari families”, making it very hard to prevent their deportation\.

TURKEY

In the last couple of weeks, news about mass deportation of Syrian refugees from Turkish cities, especially Istanbul, to Northern Syria have increased exponentially\. Authorities have allegedly targeted both documented and undocumented people and have forced them to sign ‘voluntary leave’ papers prior to their deportation\. [HERE](https://www.facebook.com/Syria.violations.monitoring/photos/a.1761072347242971/3141797249170467/?type=3&permPage=1) is the last case we heard of\.

As reported by [Infomigrants](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/18545/istanbul-expels-more-than-15-000-undocumented-migrants?fbclid=IwAR1s3E8uBHEdArpiUE1uBd4H_jlTYjTjYW8g0ge8UxnRQ0VQjdT6gL-GUxw) , Turkish officials reject these claims, but [boasted](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/18545/istanbul-expels-more-than-15-000-undocumented-migrants?fbclid=IwAR0SH_q2eSaGXo9qKI_3ExyENWMQe4aXiEjJe7aiR7xm4RVMIxn132bT0tQ) recently that they had “expelled 15,000 undocumented migrants from Istanbul in the past 20 days, among them 2,630 Syrian nationals”, who are said to be teken to detention centres outside the city\.

#### 163 people await for Europe to decide of their lives

In the last few days both the Sea Eye’s Alan Kurdi and Open Arms rescue vessel have responded to a number of distress calls, rescuing 163 people\.

Infomigrants [report](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/18558/two-ngo-boats-with-over-160-rescued-migrants-stuck-in-mediterranean-looking-for-safe-harbor?fbclid=IwAR0hH5QIk7HOL_mxSeQ5cfTrkutI6ic6VhIFSy0EmSHrTquKsDn332Gswmo) that one of the two pregnant women on the Open Arms ship has gone into labour\.

Like a clock, Italian authorities have started their usual ‘game’\. As we reported yesterday, the Alan Kurdi has been requested to head to Malta, despite being only a few miles off Lampedusa\. Open Arms [report](https://twitter.com/openarms_it/status/1157306703504969728?fbclid=IwAR27WikWqAkgshumt17sUedq8EzfZVzOP7-CwCbPILQgmLfIkU3iuIWEz9E) that they received a communication from the Italian government threatening them with a 50,000€ fine if they enter territorial waters\. This goes with the 900,000 threatened by the Spanish government if the vessel head back to Spain\.

At the time of writing, the Alan Kurdi was heading to Malta, while the Open Arms was on her way towards Lampedusa, as reported by [Radio Popolare](https://www.radiopopolare.it/indice-dei-podcast/) \.

In the meanwhile no further information are available about 35 people on a boat off the Libyan coast who launched a [distress call to Alarmphone](https://www.facebook.com/watchthemed.alarmphone/photos/a.1526182797655958/2421721974768698/?type=3&theater) yesterday and corpses keep washing up on the Libyan shore, after the shipwreck of last week\.

#### Donations for Ventimiglia’s Foodbank needed

Kesha Niya, [report](https://www.facebook.com/KeshaNiyaProject/posts/963667683978099) about the changes in Ventimiglia


> The situation in Ventimiglia is constantly changing\. Many people are still arriving to Italy by boat or by foot, it’s then also the same in Ventimiglia\. The numbers of people we provide with food is slowly rising and we see many new faces everyday\. \* \* 





> Since a long time some members of the [Roya Citoyenne](https://www.facebook.com/royacitoyenne/) are taking care of the Foodbank, which supplies everyone with free food who is supporting migrants here in the valley\. The Foodbank runs on donations of big and small tin cans of all sorts, tea, coffee, cookies, sugar, water, oil, bread, jam, or whatever other products you can think of … But in the last couple of months there were almost no donations coming in and so the Foodbank is struggling to keep it going\. 
 

> But not only this, the Roya Citoyenne are one of our main supporters\. Not only through the Foodbank, also with money donations, which are also getting way less\.

Anti\-migrant behaviour of Tuzla authorities and Asylum officers has been increasingly more appalling\. We reported in last weeks about the ban from using toilets and electric plugs in the asylum office building\. Now, in front of the building, [lime has been sprinkled](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2564515010266380&set=a.742693779115188&type=3&theater) to stop people from sitting down while they wait \(up to days\) for their turn\.
