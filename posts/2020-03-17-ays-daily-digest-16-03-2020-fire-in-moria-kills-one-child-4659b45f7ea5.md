A fire in Moria camp broke out in the early afternoon, in between Levels 1 and 2\. Video footage of the blaze can be found [here](https://twitter.com/KallergisK/status/1239518348100153344?fbclid=IwAR3QCb3EDcMnZk_eFHpyGvoq_a6quDXwMoJ_cDe4ChIh84ZDIRyGHqp0tno) and [here \.](https://www.facebook.com/douglas.herman.104/posts/10157865009985813)

The cause of the fire is as of yet unknown\. The Guardian [reported](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/child-killed-in-lesbos-refugee-camp-fire) that it broke out in one of the shipping containers, which had been used to house people, and spread rapidly through the camp due to high winds\. It eventually [burned down](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/child-dies-fire-greek-migrant-camp-lesbos-200316133927218.html) two containers and several tents before firefighters and residents were able to contain it\. One child, between six or seven years old, was found dead by firefighters in a [container](https://twitter.com/rspaegean/status/1239674358093828103) \. Many people were treated for injury and shock\.

Even if the causes that sparked the fire itself are not at this moment preciesly known, the factors which led to its uncontrolled spread are perfectly clear\. The crowded conditions in the camp make it easy for a fire to spread\. The housing, i\.e\. tents and containers, do not provide adequate conditions for cooking or heating one’s home, making it more likely that accidents occur\. There was a fire [two months ago](https://twitter.com/MSF_Sea/status/1239563010554966018?fbclid=IwAR2lgPMpHBmul9u7RallpbOMLHSdGK992gKzaMs8hnc7PMlKcv2h2-eoV-k) in Kara Tepe and five months ago in Moria itself, but no actions have been taken since then to make conditions in the camp safer\. If basic things such as fire safety cannot be guaranteed to people stuck in Moria and other Greek camps, then a rapidly spreading disease like coronavirus could cause an unimaginable catastrophe\.

Even after the fire was put out, unsafe conditions [continued](https://twitter.com/refocusmedialab/status/1239632594414768129) \. The affected area was [not sealed off](https://www.facebook.com/refocusmedialabs/posts/2828168867413324) , and people had to walk through the rubble\. This could cause further injuries, especially since many people forced to live in Moria do not have proper footwear\. Alarm Phone [reported](https://www.facebook.com/watchthemed.alarmphone/photos/a.1526182797655958/2612934538980773/?type=3&theater) that many people in Moria have not had access to water for the past 3 days besides the plastic drinking water bottles that are handed out\. Not only does this make cleaning and using the toilet difficult, it makes putting out fires or following the hygienic measures necessary to prevent an epidemic impossible\.

This tragedy just adds to the argument many people on the move and workers on the ground have been making: Moria is not a safe place to house people\. People must be evacuated immediately and given safe housing and asylum, whether in Greece or elsewhere in Europe\. Medicins Sans Frontieres [called for](https://twitter.com/MSF/status/1239273158622023688) an evacuation of the hotspots on Sunday, which was echoed by other NGOs like [Alarm Phone](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1239650232046178306?fbclid=IwAR0hDVA2kuNU1aamKGj8jTRcn-ub_woxGieJi1M6Aeqp6DBTv0P8Z7ubMCw) , saying an outbreak would be almost impossible to contain\. German MEP Erik Marquardt, who was visiting the camp at the time, [agreed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/child-killed-in-lesbos-refugee-camp-fire) with the necessity of immediate evacuation\.


> Anyone who does not act now will be complicit in the catastrophe that is awaiting everyone here in Lesbos\. 





Some people are working tirelessly to stop the possible spread of coronavirus in Moria and other Greek camps\. There is a fundraiser you can donate to [here](https://www.facebook.com/donate/229784944873135/) for disinfecting gel and the production of masks\. Although anti\-bacterial hand sanitizer is not the ideal way to combat the virus, unfortunately many in Moria do not have access to soap and water and this is regarded as the best alternative\.

Others are working to spread awareness about coronavirus and information about best practices, such as the [Moria Corona Awareness Team](https://www.stonisi.gr/post/7675/sthnoyn-oyres-sto-soyper-market-kai-enhmerwnoyn-toys-aitoyntes-asylo?fbclid=IwAR00QXu2kRb1Rr1V6ObEKsnhZgEOyZ4HSFOj9N6P2vXsgC-DeqQ0NUxcVR8) \. It is made up of representatives of different communities and professions, such as teachers and pharmacists, concerned about the lack of information and preparedness for an epidemic in the camp\. They are [working](https://www.facebook.com/www.standbymelesvos.gr/posts/59260954799873) to cover the “non\-medical side” of the epidemic by starting a sewing factory to produce masks and spreading information about new regulations\. On Monday, they sent out small teams to help enforce new rules about shopping \(five people in, five people out, maintaining appropriate distance in line\) in the Mytilini supermarket and in the camp supermarket\. The town council also [asked](https://standbymelesvos.gr/2020/moria-corona-awareness-team-goes-on/?fbclid=IwAR1RGY3a5CGWDqs5w1Uurk1Ln53JjiEgl_clZv0wuP8Zdy9Xd1yyqFs13yE) the volunteers to help the management of the village main street, and soon more teams will be added to buses and other public places\. They are also asking all volunteers and anyone looking to organize non\-medical activities to contact them before proceeding as they know the most about the needs of residents\. Contact information for the Moria Corona Awareness Team can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/www.standbymelesvos.gr/posts/592609547998738) \.

Day Care Center Athens published a [video](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1934903689968255) giving important information about the virus in Farsi\.

Many nonprofits are limiting their activities in the camps in order to [prevent](https://dagens.klassekampen.no/2020-03-16/krever-evakuering-na) the spreading of the virus\. Only medical and absolutely necessary activities are allowed to continue\. Many are asking the numerous European volunteers who are not part of any organization but flew to Greece recently to go home, as they could unintentionally spread the virus to people in the camps\.

The Greek government [announced](https://www.facebook.com/HumanityDOESmatter/posts/2882577705098636) travel restrictions on Sunday\. Travel links with Albania and North Macedonia are interrupted as is transport to and from Spain and Italy\. Fines of € 5,000 will be imposed on those who show “anti\-social behavior\.”

Starting today, [Khora Social Kitche](https://www.facebook.com/KhoraAthens/posts/1396941843811753?hc_location=ufi) n in Athens will only serve food to take away and the cafe will be closed\. The goal is to prevent crowded conditions which allow for the spread of coronavirus, but continue to provide hot meals to the people who need them\.

Mobile Info Team will be [working remotely](https://twitter.com/mobileinfoteam/status/1239521236318851073?fbclid=IwAR1d2Jx-IINLZpVe-VUa1y8PpEOZ6sXELZ6LynPeicRPxteCDgRWwjZyFnw) to provide information about the asylum process\.

The Pampiraiki warehouse in Asclipiou will be closed until further notice\.

Our House has to [pause](https://www.facebook.com/ourhousegr/?__tn__=kC-R&eid=ARBt_9gk-8oF1hXWXlpzwDDEsiSlEGykgqolv7UmlkTBK2br48vBSyDweT3SLeoFK0MmxpramAiIEiJN&hc_ref=ARTbBf8_6XfllycwACkVB1pWXYxWDuV8X2T8RTFdbGEZUitrVKgCC4cuRR4yc4UYxlE&fref=nf) their community work due to lack of support\.

Since most of their materials are in a warehouse in Croatia and the borders are now closed, they are in need of donations\. Information about how to donate can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/NoNameKitchenBelgrade/posts/938235849908033?__tn__=K-R) \.

BOSNIA & HERZEGOVINA
### Una\-Sana Canton Severely Limits Freedoms of People on the Move in Response to Coronavirus

In a [statement](https://usn.co.ba/izdvojeno/vazna-obavijest-ovo-su-nove-naredbe-kriznog-staba-usk-povodom-koronavirusa/170003/?fbclid=IwAR2Awj7WKbgsVfP1ww3CTZun9OyxgyNqvhltqV2Tetj59SJmRo_EYBlav2k) by the crisis team of the canton’s health minister, the government highlighted the region’s lack of resources, proximity to the EU and several other borders, and the dangerous nature of the disease as justification for the following measures\.

People on the move in Una\-Sana canton will not be allowed to leave the camps\. Those who are sleeping rough \(about 2000 people\) will be moved into the camps\. People seeking asylum cannot enter the canton or move within the canton on any mode of transportation, including by foot\. Those who were housed in private homes are no longer allowed to live there, unless they have their paperwork\.

Their announcement was followed by a [message](https://usn.co.ba/bih/saopcenje-ministarstva-sigurnosti-bih-hitno-skloniti-migrante-s-ulica/169997/?fbclid=IwAR0Bfnm1pksm_jefDKEQkd7E3IPSvJd0RKKKopTwOKW4oRJOXMjmqbNlmPE) from the Security Minister of Bosnia & Herzegovina that all people on the move should be moved from the streets, their movements limited, and that they should be housed in former army buildings or tents\.

This goes against the UNHCR’s directive \(which we elaborate on below\) that emergency measures cannot target specific groups of people\. There have been little to no reported cases of people on the move spreading coronavirus, but many reported cases of irresponsible travelers from the EU doing so, yet there is no mention of limiting the movement of EU citizens in this statement\. Conditions in the camps in Bosnia are already horrendous and will become worse if thousands more people are imprisoned inside\.

CROATIA
### Are You Syrious Is Limiting Its Activities

In order to be responsible and try to avoid spreading the disease, Are You Syrious is limiting its activities\. Our free shop in Zagreb will be closed for the time being and we will organize weekly deliveries of hygiene products instead of daily distribution\. Instead of visiting families in their homes, we are offering online support and learning to children\. Programs in the camp, apart from limited distributions and health services are also on pause because we do not want to bring the virus into camps\.

We will update once all our activities are back to normal\. What’s most important right now is everyone’s health and safety, especially the health and safety of the most vulnerable among us\.

ITALY
### Coronavirus Affects the Futures of People on the Move in Italy

As Italy is gripped by the epidemic and all of its residents must come to terms with the uncertainty of living in a time of crisis, this uncertainty and fear is [doubled](http://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/news/2020/03/16/italy-coronavirus-migrants-asylum-seekers?fbclid=IwAR1odmPd5F4osqISY9XJ_KRDwarcF_70LaOQ-SQyAOB_DpFnU8cxhaBImws) for people who have to worry about their legal status and who do not have safe homes to stay in\.

Services to help people, such as integration services and offices to process paperwork, are greatly reduced\. The government has suspended applications, renewals and interviews\. Courts will be closed at least for the rest of the month\. People rescued at sea are to be quarantined for two weeks before they are allowed to land\. The virus has also allowed xenophobic rhetoric to gain even more prominence in Italy \(if such a thing was possible\) as some claim allowing people on the move to continue entering Italy’s ports will spread the disease\.

One of the biggest barriers has been the lack of information in languages other than Italian\. [This page](https://www.ilgrandecolibri.com/coronavirus-spiegato-migranti-asilanti/?fbclid=IwAR3YSmEGbV7KKrfGxBFNWtt8GVJgwtC5BBlb4oOrLTVJD-Zkg39VQQ67Sys#ing) has information about the virus’ spread, prevention, and legal measures put in place by the Italian government in English, Mandinka, Pashtu, and more\.

It is most important to note that people on the move have the same right to healthcare as Italian citizens and can seek treatment regardless of their legal status\. Medecins du Monde has a [phone number](https://www.facebook.com/grispiemonte/posts/2696276537149837) which people who do not have a doctor can call to get more information about the virus\. The number is: \+393510221390\.


FRANCE
### France Automatically Extends Residency Permits For Three Months

The press release by the French ministry of the interior can be found [here](https://www.liberation.fr/direct/element/les-titres-de-sejour-prolonges-de-3-mois_110693/?fbclid=IwAR07uYwSHYUiPIo0rJdQnDFO-oihoL4LhXE_ojvFUc1yUMXIWqGwFTFyRTY) \.

Due to the current epidemic, applicants for residency and other legal paperwork will no longer be able to get appointments at the prefectures indefinitely\. In order to avoid people losing access to benefits during an epidemic, most types of legal status are extended automatically\.

This applies to long stay visas, residence permits \(except those given to diplomats\), temporary residence authorizations, asylum application certificates, and those with récepissés, or temporary residency cards given just after an application is submitted\.

Collective Aid France is collecting money for non\-food items such as tents and clothing\. You can donate [here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/collective-aid-france-nonfood-items?fbclid=IwAR0weGXiBp9DD-jj4ZGUJIQwtDjUN6ko1NKwjSZA4E9zpGxRVHPm4KSp0LA) \.

FAST and Care4Calais are working together to set up hand sanitizing stations, distribute multivitamins, and provide information about the virus in French, Arabic, Farsi, Kurdish and English\. They are also in need of [donations](https://www.facebook.com/care4calais/posts/3091939400838996) to continue their activities\.

GENERAL
### UNHCR Warns Against Using Coronavirus To Justify Human Rights Abuses


> While we recognize the severity of the current health crisis and acknowledge that the use of emergency power is allowed by international law in response to significant threats, we urgently remind states that any emergency response to the coronavirus must be proportionate, necessary and non\-discriminatory\. 





The human rights experts [warned](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=25722&LangID=E&fbclid=IwAR0KCstFUHjU6QWWr-IXFSGDJIbESchfwyLIZGNPxIiF-jhrgBdSFp56UaI) against using the state of emergency as justification to target certain groups of people or to enact general repressive measures\.

The epidemic has already been used by states such as Hungary and Greece to justify closing their borders to asylum seekers and increasing border violence\.

EU
### EU To Close Schengen Borders to Non\-Essential Travel

The European Union is closing its external borders to all “non\-essential travel” to try and stop the spread of coronavirus, president Ursula von der Leyen [announced](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/16/europe/spain-coronavirus-lockdown-intl/index.html) \.

The measure still has to be put to a vote on Tuesday by the European Council but she estimates it will be approved\.

It is unclear yet what this means for people on the move\. We will keep you updated as more information rolls in\.
