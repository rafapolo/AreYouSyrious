“ ‘Set us free’ being chanted on the peace March on Samos today protesting against the new camp\.” — by: [Gemma Bird](https://twitter.com/gemmakristina)
### FEATURED REPORTS
### “Go ahead, kill yourselves\!”

Stating what many previous reports and testimonies already confirmed, the recent OHCHR report on Search and Rescue and the protection of migrants in the Mediterranean explicitly confirmed that detention centre guards urged desperate and suicidal people in the centres to “go ahead, kill yourselves”…\.
Their officials also received information regarding multiple instances of depression, self\-harm and attempted suicide within immigration detention centres, as well as talking about the role of Frontex in the whole operation\.

The report features information on detention conditions in Malta, detailing people in overcrowded spaces with lack of adequate sanitary facilities and medical supplies, including poor prevention of COVID\-19\. Malta thus adheres to the practice that all rescued persons within the Malta SAR region should be disembarked in the nearest place of safety as provided for in the pre\-amendment legislation\. Not having signed the 2004 amendments to the SAR and SOLAS Conventions, the Maltese authorities tell the people **they have three options: return to Libya, continue to Lampedusa or continue to Malta and be arrested upon arrival\.**

It also documents how people were prevented from continuing to Malta, on how women and girls were sold to human traffickers after they were returned to Libya, and how all the suffering takes place away from any public scrutiny, care or attention:


> _When they rescued us they gave us hope… but then they dumped us here\. Here we are still treated like criminals, only here everything is invisible\._

### The past year in Croatia

Asylum Information Database \( **AIDA\) country report on Croatia** draws on information gathered through the practice of the Croatian Law Centre, data and information provided by Administrative Courts, the High Administrative Court, the Croatian Employment Service, IOM, UNHCR, attorneys at law and relevant organisations, including Are You Syrious\.

Apart from the appalling, still present reports on the border violence, meticulously reported by the Border Violence Monitoring Network \(BVMN\), reports on deaths of people on the move were also documented\. In the past year there were records of dead bodies found floating in the Mrežnica River, and the Korana River, near Karlovac\. Sadly, such and other unreported tragedies still continue to happen, along with a number of reported instances of expulsions from police stations across the country, with people going missing, unreported pushbacks, and mistreatment of people asking for asylum\.

Find the entire report \(on 2020\) here:
### GREECE
### Protest on Samos

On Sunday 30th May, a peaceful protest was organised to demonstrate against the opening of the new refugee camp in Samos, and the EU asylum seeking process in general\.

The Pan\-Samian Peace Committee arranged a march from the location of the new camp, all the way to Vathy — a two hour walk in total — with the intention of spreading awareness about these issues\. It was also an opportunity for the community in Vathy to voice their frustration with the proposed plans of the new camp\.

Whilst information about the new camp remains scarce, we believe the closure of the Vathy camp is the next step in further marginalising the refugee community, moving the problem out of sight as opposed to providing a meaningful solution\.

We want to add our support to the refugee community and the Pan\-Samian Peace Committee, advocating for a more humane asylum seeking procedure as well as the halting of new camp policy and a more meaningful alternative to detention\.

As Greece boasts fewer COVID\-19 cases ahead of the start of the tourist season, many of the restrictions are being lifted and life is getting back to a more active one, but not for everyone\. As we reported earlier, people inside the refugee camps are being left out when it comes to freedom of movement, but also when it comes to healthcare and protection\. Following that infamous practice, it is reported that while 0 vaccines were distributed and given to people in Moria 2\.0, the camp quarantine is currently full\.

The local medical authorities have stated that the 36% increase in the number of coronavirus cases is due to the incidents in Kara Tepe — Moria 2\.0, it is [reported](https://twitter.com/AVeizis/status/1398651332383367170) \. A similar situation is in other camps, with no provision of COVID\-19 vaccines:

Pushbacks continue, reactions fade

While documented illegal refoulements of migrants in the Aegean Sea multiply, and the Council of Europe, amongst others, calls for inquiries into the matter, Athens continues to deny and welcomes the drop in arrivals on the Greek islands\.

As we and the BVMN fellow activists have [reported](https://www.borderviolence.eu/response-to-greek-ombudsmans-interim-report/) extensively on this earlier on, and the mainstream media seems to be picking up on the subject more \-read the latest piece by Le Monde [here\.](https://racistcrimeswatch.wordpress.com/2021/05/29/1-1194/?fbclid=IwAR0rspyS2rnl9YOodDIK8CRhRR_0NsjxYNSSbQp0EvVvkJ_qKi0-R06qIzA)

One of the organisations present in the area and reporting about this is Josoor\. They are now in need of support:

More than ever, we need the support of donations if we are to continue with our work at this critical time\. If we don’t get enough private donations and all grant providers and organisations we apply to continue to refuse us funding on the grounds of this Greek criminalisation campaign, we will simply cease to exist — and with us, the only organisation in Turkey focused on supporting pushback survivors at the European Union’s external borders\.

Consider supporting them [here\.](https://www.josoor.net/?fbclid=IwAR32e2P9jmkZdjovukMhUNC-qLFcVVPr2ywJ5814-oY7XDRE0H3KIVhMw9Q)

Our first workshop for the Eritrean community was delivered in French and Tigrinya, with written info in French, German and English\. We explained what constitutes an act of violence, the rights and responsibilities of the police, how to identify different types of police and their arms and what to do in cases of police violence\.

Police violence is a real risk for people on the move, and many more people could still benefit from this advice\.

Lyon protests

Over 1500 people gathered in the streets of Lyon to protest far right and police violence, after Lyon has suffered a string of recent fascist attacks, [**Antifa International**](https://twitter.com/antifaintl) **reported in a photo story:**

Canary Islands: 58 people rescued

Arson in Blankenburg — groups from Oldenburg declare their solidarity with those affected

Solidarity without Borders Oldenburg collective, anti\-racist group United Against Racism, and other activists in the area have published a [media statement](https://sowibol.noblogs.org/post/2021/05/29/pressemitteilung-brandanschlag-in-blankenburg-gruppen-aus-oldenburg-erklaren-ihre-solidaritat-mit-den-betroffenen/) on the arson that happened on Friday night, saying that two incendiary devices were detonated in the Oldenburg branch of the Lower Saxony State Reception Authority in Blankenburg Abbey\. One of them damaged a building that is currently inhabited by people\.

To our great relief, no one was physically injured\.

Last year there were three arson attacks on restaurants operated by migrants in the vicinity of Oldenburg in the Bremen area in Syke, Gnarrenburg and Ganderkesee, which can clearly be assigned to a series of right\-wing attacks, the activists point out\.

The attacks in Hanau, Kassel and Halle also show that right\-wing violence still has its place in Germany\. We are shocked and want complete clarification and consistency\. — United Against Racism

The hidden story of Esparto 11

Also, the waiting time for medical appointments to assess detainees’ torture claims grew to 21 days in August last year, it was reported by [Independent Monitoring Board](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/may/21/uk-asylum-seekers-at-unprecedented-risk-of-suicide-amid-deportation-threat) \.

In the meantime, shock and disbelief at the stories of people who were on board the Esparto 11 deportation flight that left Stansted on 12 August last year are once again reminding people of the unprecedented move by the Home Office, and its consequences\. “Accompanied by scores of escorts, just 14 asylum seekers would be pressed on board the 295\-seat aircraft\. Bound for Toulouse and Frankfurt, Esparto 11 would dump its detainees thousands of miles from home\. It is not known what happened to the man who self\-harmed in the toilet,” the Guardian [reports](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/may/29/asylum-seekers-risked-all-to-get-to-the-uk-then-they-were-deported-at-dawn?fbclid=IwAR3XpHIGMtXnQgn8e3X0hULOPvEfL7Gp8TVhry1UoruDYiAN9s67NwSz_wc) \. As they say, the story yields a fundamental question: **why is the world’s fifth\-richest economy so aggressively targeting a handful of at\-risk people who arrived seeking sanctuary?** 
The chair of the parliamentary group on immigration detention believes the Esparto 11 revelations are so grave that Priti Patel “should consider her position in light of these shocking reports”\.
