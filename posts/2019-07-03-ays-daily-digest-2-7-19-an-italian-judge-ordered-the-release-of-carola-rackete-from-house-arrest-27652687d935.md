#### UPDATE: At least 40 people died in the night when Tajoura Migrant Detention Centre in Libya was bombed by airstrikes\.

Tajoura migrant detention centre, in a suburb of the Libyan capital Tripoli, was bombed last night\. Media [report](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/03/air-strike-kill-libya-tripoli-migrant-detention-centre?fbclid=IwAR2IzM53dgHhrJ8fH2HG12_KRU68prYMsPuCxrcJ70gY_vEfbllJca8wtKU) that the camp has been destroyed\. At least 40 people had been killed and other 80 were wounded\.

“ [Osama Ali, a spokesman for the emergency services, told AFP that 120 migrants had been in a hangar which was directly hit by the strike in Tajoura\. He added that more people may have been killed because the death toll so far was ‘a preliminary assessment’](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/03/air-strike-kill-libya-tripoli-migrant-detention-centre?fbclid=IwAR2IzM53dgHhrJ8fH2HG12_KRU68prYMsPuCxrcJ70gY_vEfbllJca8wtKU) ”\.

Tajoura detention centre holds up to 600/700 people\. Both side of the armed conflict blame each others for the airstrikes\.

Sally Hayden was in contact with people in the detention centre:

In the last weeks Italian government voted to continue its mission in Libya, and Italian embassy’s officers went to visit Tajoura detention centre, stating that their key priorities include promoting “better living conditions which fully respect human rights”\. The mission in Libya was initiated in 2017\. We all saw the condition of migrant detention centres in the country\.

We will keep updating on the situation in our next digests\.
#### Feature: Criminalizing Sea Rescue

ProActiva Open Arms is calling for the end of criminalizing sea rescue by docking Wednesday morning at 8:30am at the European Parliament in Strasbourg\. A press conference with Anabel Montes from Proactiva Open Arms will follow at 10am with an introduction by Miguel Urbán MEP\.

**At least 597 people died** in the Mediterranean so far in 2019\. By refusing to help and protect sea rescue, it is Europe committing a criminal act, not the brave rescuers like captain Carola Rackete\.

[An Italian judge](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/02/more-than-1m-raised-for-rescue-ship-captain-carola-rackete-italy) ordered the release of Carola Rackete from house arrest on Tuesday\. Judge Alessandra Vella “ _ruled that Rackete had been carrying out her duty to protect life and had not committed any act of violence_ \.” AYS continues to stay in solidarity with Carola and every sea rescuer\.

> > We are relieved our captain is free! ❤️🚀 There were no grounds to keep her arrested, as here only 'wrongdoing' was to enforce human rights on the Mediterranean and to take responsibility where none of the European governments did. #FreeCarola #FreeCarolaRackete #CarolaRackete

#### Turkey

Anti\-Syrian language is only continuing post Istanbul elections\. Some Syrians was even lynched after false claims arose of an underage Syrian boy sexually harassed a underage Turkish girl\. Turkey is not a safe third country for refugees and it’s becoming almost impossible for Syrians to even cross into Turkey\.

Mobil Info Team compiled a packet of all the necessary information concerning the first asylum interview\. Find it [here](https://www.facebook.com/mobileinfoteam/posts/2475153386046709?hc_location=ufi) \.


> “You can find answers about how to prepare for your asylum interview, what kind of questions you will be asked or you will receive some tips how to behave in your asylum interview\. Remember that preparing for your interview is very important and can make the difference if you will get accepted or not\.” 





[Legal Centre Lesvos](https://www.facebook.com/notes/legal-centre-lesvos/baseless-smuggling-charges-not-only-in-italy-but-are-a-regular-occurrence-in-les/2484056258299739/) explain how baseless smuggling charges happen frequently in on the Greek hotspot:


> “ it is common practice of the local police to arrest the driver of the boat and charge him \(in most cases it is men who are driving\) with smuggling\.” 





> “As we at the Legal Centre and our partners at [Christian Peacemakers Lesvos](https://web.facebook.com/CPTLesvos/) have documented, **it is often migrants themselves who are forced to drive…** The individuals charged are denied the basic rights to a fair trial, guaranteed under Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights, as they are routinely denied adequate interpretation, are denied a fair hearing, and convictions are based on the sole fact that the individual was driving…” 





In other words, the drivers are never the smugglers themselves\. They are found in the very unlucky position, in order to get everyone on the boat to Europe\.

Aegean Boat Report’s monthly statistics: **402 boats** arrived to the Greek islands in June while **707 boats** were stopped by the Turkish Coast Guard\. **almost 13,000 people** have arrived to the islands so far in 2019\.

#### Mainland

[A Greek NGO](https://www.facebook.com/resistevictions/photos/a.2125658524398393/2125655051065407/?type=3&theater) provides an update on the situation of throwing Afghan refugees out of apartments: Learn more here\.


> “The evictions of refugees from apartments living with the support of the dormitory programme continue to be performed “normally”, throwing families and people on the street without any further basic care for their housing and food\. There has been a process of exclusion, in front of our eyes for two months, following the decision of the ministry of migration policy and the high commissioner for refugees to remove the “refugees” from the apartments, without any meaningful preparation or conditions of equal living and without \(the ability to\) take their lives into their own hands\.”
