Today we want to start with something on our own behalf: The [digest the day before yesterday](ays-daily-digest-05-08-18-four-migrant-labourers-die-in-crash-in-italy-b1829975fe79) was the 1000th story we have published on medium\. For almost three years now, we have provided you — our readers — with daily updates from the field and hotspots all over Europe and further\. In the AYS team, we always try our best to verify the information we find and receive and use reliable sources\. Furthermore many members of our team publish special reports, based on their research, in order to explain the background behind these crises, and give insight into particular regions\.

So has the number of people intercepted by the Libyan Coast Guard &amp; sent back to face arbitrary detention and abuse. 
Has this anything to do with European policies on #migration ? 
In a new briefing out tomorrow, we try to answer. https://t.co/dqsMkQb0Y0

It is kind of a success for our small team to publish so many stories for such a long time \(and we are always happy to welcome new members\) \. Nevertheless, we did not expect that this would be necessery for so long\. Unfortunately, we feel that our daily reports are just as important today as they were when we started, if not more so\.

While it feels like so long ago now, there was once a glimpse of hope that Europe would stand up for its values and laws\. However, the public debate has shifted far right in the last three years\. Since Italy started to refuse rescue ships from disembarking at its ports, humanitarians all over Europe started to stand up\. Europeans all over are calling not for policies of fortress Europe, but human rights\. This movement is something we should build on\. It always existed, and now it is getting a louder voice\. From our work we know that there are many people all over the world standing in solidarity against cruel borders and for human rights\.

Hence, we want to encourage you today to sign a petition that is supposed to be submitted to the European Commission by the initiative Let Us Help\! They need one million signatures from at least seven EU countries, at which point the EC is obliged to respond to the proposal\. The demands are:
- Citizens across Europe want to sponsor refugees to offer them a safe home and a new life\. **We want the Commission to offer direct support to local groups that help refugees who are granted national visas\.**
- No one should be prosecuted or fined for offering humanitarian help or shelter\. **We want the Commission to stop those governments that are punishing volunteers\.**
- Everyone has the right to justice\. **We want the Commission to guarantee more effective ways and rules to defend all victims of labour exploitation and crime across Europe and all victims of human rights abuses at our borders\.**

### Afghanistan

Unfortunately it cannot be stressed often enough these days: Afghanistan is not a safe country for many people\. To help the people fleeing the country because of violence, threats, and persecution is not only a human obligation but also one of the international community\. [Last Friday](https://aoav.org.uk/2018/suicide-attack-on-mosque-in-afghanistans-gardez-kills-48/) , 48 people were killed and more than 70 injured during an attack on a mosque by two suicide bombers\.
### Libya

The Italian embassy in Libya [announced](https://twitter.com/italyinlibya/status/1026861708667760641?s=21) that it will provide twelve patrol boats to the Libyan Coast Guard as well as training to the units\.
### Sea

### Italy

So far this month, only 55 people arrived in Italy according to UNHCR\. In total, this means less than 19,000 this year between January 1 and August 5, compared to 96,000 in the same period of 2017\.
### Greece

According to [official numbers](http://mindigital.gr/index.php/%CF%80%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%86%CF%85%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C-%CE%B6%CE%AE%CF%84%CE%B7%CE%BC%CE%B1-refugee-crisis/2692-national-situational-picture-regarding-the-islands-at-eastern-aegean-sea-06-08-2018) provided by the Greek Ministry of the Interior, almost 10,000 people are accommodated on Lesvos at the moment — more than 50% of the total number of asylum seekers on all the islands\. 7400 people are cramped in official camp sites, which are designed to accommodate 3100 people\. But the other islands are far over their capacity as well\. On Samos, the occupation is at 600%\! 3600 people are residing in facilities built to host only 650 people\.

The [Jafra Foundation for Relief](https://www.facebook.com/JafraFoundationinGreece/posts/1796909893677351) in Athens has still free places for its photography course\. The training days are Monday and Wednesday from 2 to 4pm\.

A Drop in the Ocean [is looking](https://www.facebook.com/drapenihavet/photos/a.1137876822896432.1073741828.1133308640019917/2205799742770796/?type=3&theater) for coordinators all over Greece\.
### Bulgaria

EU Scoop [reports](https://www.euscoop.com/en/2018/8/6/migrants-entering-bulgaria-less-leaving) , referencing Dnevnik, that more people have been arrested by the police while trying to leave the country \(88\) than while entering it \(52\) in June and July\. Hence, they conclude that more people are leaving the country than entering\.
### Serbia

UNHCR and its partners collected evidence of 335 pushbacks to Serbia during the last two weeks\. 197 were sent back unlawfully from Croatia, 63 from Hungary, 54 from Romania and 21 from Bosnia\. Most of them were Afghans, followed by Pakistanis and Iraqis\. More than half of them were denied the possibility of requesting asylum, almost one fifth experienced physical abuse, and 17% experienced other maltreatment by authorities of these neighboring countries\. More than 1000 people asked for asylum in Serbia in July, which is the highest number so far this year, raising the total count to 4700\. In the same period of 2017, the number was around 3500\.
### Bosnia

Causascomuns today published some impressions from Bosnian makeshift camps\.

### Croatia

[Second home — in exile](https://www.facebook.com/pg/secondhomeljubljana/photos/?tab=album&album_id=702036313469730) and No Name Kitchen published the story of an Iranian citizen today who escaped from Iran to protect herself and her child from her abusive husband, because neither her government nor the authorities did anything to protect her\. Approximately 30 km before the Slovenian border she was part of a group of people that the police pushed back to Bosnia\. The police beat all of the people in the group, including this woman\. Even her child was knocked onto the ground by a policeman\. There were many minors in the group\. But the border police hardly seem to differentiate between teenagers and adults, or even children\. Between the Croatian\-Bosnian border, the border police stole their money, phones and tablets, and broke the phones of many others\. From the Iranian woman alone they took 500 euros\.

### Spain

ProActiva received permission to disembark the 87 rescued people in Algeciras, Spain\. The ship is more than 590 sea miles off the coast and will need approximately three more days to get to port\. Meanwhile, they are running low on food supplies\. Most of the rescued people are from the unsafe region of Darfur, Sudan\. They spent around 50 hours on their vessel without water\. Some have burns caused by the mix of salt water and fuel\. But according to [El Diario](https://www.eldiario.es/desalambre/Gobierno-Espana-rescatados-Open-Arms_0_801070317.html) , Spain will not give a one\-month residence permit to the rescued people\.
### Germany

In June, the German government stopped the restriction to only deport criminals and potential security threats back to Afghanistan\. But almost all federal states still keep more or less to this procedure and do not deport Afghans in general, as a survey among the interior ministers by the Evangelischer Pressedienst \(protest and press service\) showed, Migazin [writes](http://www.migazin.de/amp/2018/08/07/einschraenkungen-laender-schieben-nur-bestimmte-gruppen-nach-afghanistan-ab/?utm_source=wysija&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=MiGAZIN+Newsletter) \. Only Bavaria is deporting asylum seekers without restrictions at the moment\. Saxony\-Anhalt and Schleswig\-Holstein are currently trying to determine how they want to deal with the new guideline of the German government\. Seven federal states are only deporting criminals and potential security threats; others said these groups are their priority\. Saxony explained that no women or families would be deported\.

Meanwhile it is [reported](https://www.facebook.com/groups/287056371797292/permalink/443470812822513/) that the next deportation flight to Kabul — the seventh this year — is scheduled for the 14th of August\.

At the same time, in July, the number of Turkish citizens asking for asylum in Germany has sharply increased, the Rheinische Post quotes from the Bamf \(via [Zeit\.de](https://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/zeitgeschehen/2018-08/tuerkische-asylantraege-bundesamt-fuer-migration-und-fluechtlinge-anstieg) \) \. A total of 1,172 requests have been submitted, which would be the highest number so far this year\. In June, it was 884 applications\. Until the end of July, the total number was 5,107\. It is assumed that the increase was caused by the presidential and parliamentary elections in Turkey in the end of June\.

On 2nd September, activists are planning a big sea bridge demonstration in Hamburg\.

In Herford, the next demonstration is scheduled for the 11th of August\.

### Sweden

The protests in Sweden continued today in Stockholm\. Young people who arrived in 2015 demand a permanent residence permit in the country\.
