### Feature:

Restrictive asylum measures in Spain are seriously affecting pregnant women, families and those who are suffering from illness, who are being forced to sleep rough outside the Aluche National Police station in Madrid, in order to get the papers testifying that their asylum application has started and that they are protected from eviction\.

This paper is the “statement of intent to apply for international protection” and, up until May, it could be requested by an appointment over the phone\. Only 99 people a day can get such documents and that’s why the “completion” is high\. Most of the people on the move are not expecting to receive asylum \(which is a process that can take more than a year\) but the paper will give them the possibility to work temporarily and grant them protection from being deported\.

“ _Desperate to make it in, pregnant women, mothers with children, and people sick with cancer and asthma waited in line on Tuesday night on the sidewalk of Avenida de los Poblados, in the south of Madrid\. By 10pm there were already 200 cold and scared migrants lined up, hoping they would be the first through the door at 9am on Wednesday,_ ” states Fernando Peinado in [El País](https://elpais.com/elpais/2018/11/15/inenglish/1542276363_039556.html) \.

Vulnerable people have to sleep on cardboard boxes and blankets to protect themselves from the advancing cold and those who don’t make it the next day, have to stay in line in order to not lose their place and “advantage”\.

This situation represents a major obstacle for those seeking asylum in Spain, given also that the number of arrivals keeps rising: 40,000 people have applied for asylum since the beginning of 2018\.

“ _The migrants say that there are people who jump the line and dozens of others who sell their spots for €200\. They don’t understand why the police do not assign numbers to them_ ”\.

Migrants cannot move or go to look for food otherwise they could lose their place and start the whole queue again; many are also suffering intimidation from police officers in the queue\.

This is especially worrying if we take a look at the [data on arrivals](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/documents/download/66786?platform=hootsuite) in the country since the beginning of the year: 55,337 people have reached Spanish coats and land, mainly from Guinea, Morocco and Mali\. 23% of arrivals are women and children\.

As reported [before](ays-daily-digest-14-11-18-how-to-burn-the-eu-funds-aef1e1e874a5) , around 80 people still refuse to disembark the cargo ship Nivin at the port of Misratah\. Today, Amnesty International [released](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/libya-migrants-refusing-disembark-ship-must-not-be-forced-detention?fbclid=IwAR1QZzMASc8gWyoDWOW4C9JgFQPt9iSYLGX0Ha8BOyVKtULKx6JvvO68FtI) a press statement demanding that people are not forced to enter Libyan soil, saying the ship breached international law\.

Heba Morayef, Amnesty International’s Middle East and North Africa Director, said:


> “Under international law, no\-one should be sent to a place where their life is at risk\. European governments and Panama must work with Libyan authorities to find a solution for the people on board to ensure they do not end up indefinitely detained in Libyan detention centres where torture is rife\. 





Further, Amnesty demanded that Libyan authorities open the awaited processing center, where up 1000 people could be accommodated instead of in detention centres\.

Volunteers at Skaramangas camp are looking for someone, who can give a graffiti workshop for the residents\. The previous teacher left just before the lessons were due to start: the workshop would have started today, but Monday would also be possible\. It is designed to run for eight weeks, every Monday and Friday from 11am to 2pm; a small salary is provided\. Interested people can get in touch with [Caitlin](https://www.facebook.com/caitlin.plunkett.3) on facebook\.
### Italy

MEDU checked 10 patients, the majority of whom are regularly residing on the territory\. Four vulnerable people, with either physical or mental conditions have been reported to the social and medical services, in order to guarantee them the best reception as possible, but, for now, no new solution has been found for them\. MEDU asks for a stronger response from the municipality and other associations to find housing solutions for all those evacuated from Baobab \(currently, 124 people have found shelter\) \.

Like in other countries, transportation of people without status or documents remains a problem in Bosnia\. Regardless the situation the people are in, volunteers [report](https://www.facebook.com/cestacestero/posts/10216953007353642) it is not allowed to offer them a transfer\.
### Hungary

A [UN team suspended its trip to Hungary](https://www.dw.com/en/denied-access-to-migrants-un-experts-call-off-hungary-trip/a-46318612) , after being invited by the government, because it was denied access to the transit area where asylum seekers are being held\.

“ _The experts had intended to visit the Roszke and Tompa “transit zones” — two sites on the Serbian border suspected illegal detentions — but were denied permission to enter them\._

_“There can be no doubt that holding migrants in these ‘transit zones’ constitutes deprivation of liberty in accordance with international law,” said Elina Steinerte and Setondji Roland Adjovi, members of the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention_ ”\.
### France

Volunteer families and hosts are needed in Paris\. Please, get more information [here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/172900819749383/permalink/721069508265842/?hc_location=ufi) \.
### Belgium

More than 700 people are in need of urgent help in the central area of Brussels every day\. 300 of them mange to find a place to sleep in local hostel accommodations every night, leaving 400 to sleep rough on the streets, without coats, tents nor sleeping bags\.

_“People from many countries are stuck in Brussels centre, struggling to find asylum or leave the City; communities from Sudan and South Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Afghanistan and more with higher numbers from Middle Eastern countries including Iran and Syria\. \. However we are seeing more women for example I have met the same single mother with a small boy aged 7 for three weeks now_ ”\.

#### UK

In their [last report](http://refugeerights.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/refugee-rights-europe_finally-safe.pdf) , Refugees Rights Europe is critically demanding that asylum accommodation providers are held accountable for their actions in the upcoming years\.

“ _Of particular concern were the apparently widespread problems with vermin in the accommodation, with 66% of respondents reporting that they had seen vermin\. Of these, 26% had seen rats, 18% mice, 41% cockroaches, and 26% had experienced bed bugs_ ”\.
### Denmark

The residents of the Sjælsmark camp are boycotting the caféteria since 25th October and demand the closure of the camp\. Trampolinehouse [reports](https://www.trampolinehouse.dk/community/2018/11/15/boycots-in-sjlsmark?fbclid=IwAR1wtwEnPaKSO9sjiMHNKvpQqxwZgKjf3xVJi6-UmRcIwes2omrIxQOlW34) , that this camp is designed as a so called ‘motivation measure’ so rejected asylum seekers leave the country\. The food is said to be not good and to lack nutrients\. People were not able to cook for themselves and are not allowed to keep hotplates for their babies\.

The problem is, that many people are stuck in a “locked position”, as the police calls it\. Their asylum applications have been rejected, but they cannot be deported, for example due to missing papers\. “If our governments don’t want to take us back, it’s their fault, it’s not our fault\. If we travel to a different EU country, the Dublin agreement brings us back to Denmark\. Is it our fault, or the fault of the system? But they blame the families,” one of the camp residents said speaking to Trampolinehouse, comparing the situation with being imprisioned\.
### Sweden

Activists in Stockholm call for a protest to stop the deportation of 48 Afghans back to Kabul\. The demonstration will take place on Monday 19th November, at 10am at maskingatan 4\.
