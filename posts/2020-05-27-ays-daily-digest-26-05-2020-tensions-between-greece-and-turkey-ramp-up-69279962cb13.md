### Tensions Between Greece and Turkey Rise Over Evros Border

On Tuesday, K [eep Talking Greece](https://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2020/05/26/greece-deploys-hundreds-of-policemen-to-evros-border-with-turkey/) reported that the government will send 300 to 400 more police officers to Evros\. These officers will come from heavily militarized branches of the police, such as riot police and border forces, that have been involved in the [recent authoritarian backslide](https://peacedata.net/greece-takes-a-turn-back-towards-authoritarianism-how-a-new-wave-of-police-repression-is-raising-ghosts-from-greeces-dictatorial-past?fbclid=IwAR05CZWIp_A6njiruvOx5EyXc5wTA2DHDw7vfwcyR1XAM65958wLCETokyU) \. Their deployment is part of a larger campaign of increasing militarization of the border, which includes extension of the border fence, high\-tech cameras and the presence of Frontex officers\.

The border activities have already caused tensions with the Turkish government, who are disputing the extension of the border fence because it allegedly crossed into Turkish territory\. Meanwhile, the Greeks are angry because Turkish soldiers allegedly occupied an islet in the Evros River and the Turkish Foreign Minister confirmed that people on the move will be allowed to leave for Europe once the pandemic is over\.

While two governments duke it out over meters of land and tiny silt islands, one thing is clear — the real losers here are going to be people on the move\. Greek borders are already heavily militarized and there have already been countless deaths, including the man shot at Evros that the Greeks continue to deny responsibility for\. In response to a letter by Tineke Strik, a member of the European Parliament, that was signed by [over 100 MEPs](https://twitter.com/Tineke_Strik/status/1260177579815899137?fbclid=IwAR0MaNVfDYifgd95rAd9tCJ_qDJ4X2l_7UyAt8BZG_7xOZiSAns17znnApc) , the government again said the story was “fake news\.” They also reiterated the lie that Turkey is fabricating the story and using people on the move as “‘human weapons’ to undermine the [integrity of the Greek border](https://twitter.com/Tineke_Strik/status/1265228122607288325?fbclid=IwAR3ceqpJq2cr7VAwMjAWAO54imC47FjFL_D6akeZxohqcw7DJUKblnWtAkA) \.” \(It’s unlikely that constantly publishing conspiracy theories accusing Turkey will do much to improve Greek\-Turkish relations\) \. The unnecessary trauma and loss of life if Greece continues down this path could be devastating\.

SEA
### More Illegal Pushbacks From Greece

72 people were picked up on life rafts by the Turkish Coast Guard, according to information published by [Aegean Boat Report](https://www.facebook.com/AegeanBoatReport/posts/839900739866365?hc_location=ufi) \. People on board said they were put on the tiny inflatable rafts, which are not safe at all, and towed towards Turkish waters by the Greek Coast Guard\. This brings the total of people rescued from life rafts [over the past three days](https://twitter.com/teammareliberum/status/1265282916160061443?s=20&fbclid=IwAR1tMgejVIFy3oH3a5C_hBNLzDuVp_8LYPRL1H5C_vnPh7W55ehMp4qXOKQ) to 101\.

The sheer volume and repeated nature of these pushbacks over the past few months make it clear that this has become a well\-coordinated routine procedure for the Coast Guard\. Although these pushbacks have been well documented, the government denies that they are happening and the EU has said nothing, an all\-too\-common occurrence when it comes to human rights violations against people on the move\.

Over the course of three days, AlarmPhone was contacted by about 400 people traveling in [five boats total](https://www.facebook.com/watchthemed.alarmphone/photos/a.1526182797655958/2669757796631780/?type=1&theater) \. There were many interceptions, including some boats that had reached out to AlarmPhone but many others that hadn’t, and some groups that succeeded in reaching Europe on their own without needing to contact AlarmPhone\.

It’s clear that despite the rough conditions on the Mediterranean crossing and the violent measures that await them once they reach Europe, countless people are still desperate enough to make the crossing\. Many are fleeing not just violence and poverty in their home countries, but an escalating war in Libya whose torture camps have become infamous\. The sheer volume of people that have contacted AlarmPhone in need of rescue over such a short period is staggering\.

Will Europe act, or will it continue to close its eyes?

GREECE
### Infections in Kranidi, Local Tabloids Turn to Racism for an Explanation

Residents in a hotel in Kranidi currently being used to house people on the move are under a [strict fourteen\-day quarantine](https://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2020/05/26/asylum-seekers-facility-in-quarantine-after-several-tested-positive/) after three cases of COVID\-19 were detected\. This is the second time the facility is under quarantine — in April, 148 people tested positive\.

Locals are livid that people in the move are in the hotel and are asking that they be removed in preparation for the tourist season \(which probably won’t amount to much regardless of their presence\) \. Tabloids picked up the Kranidi case and turned it into a [racist, sensationalist story,](https://medium.com/@Lihtenvalner/the-greek-epidemic-of-xenophobia-and-racism-1522c5a70152) especially after news broke that several residents had turned to sex work to try and survive\. One headline read “African women offering themselves to villagers,” while another dubbed the facility “porno\-hotel\.” The prostitution story is convenient for two reasons: one, it blames the spread of coronavirus in the town on people on the move, who are putting “ [innocent Greek fathers](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157477207331158&set=a.10150615177546158&type=3&theater) ” at risk \(never mind that if the Greek fathers are willingly soliciting sex workers, they’re not that innocent after all\) \. It also creates a convenient scapegoat for the inevitable failure of this year’s tourist season\.

The biggest irony? The most plausible theory is that the first wave of infections in the hotel, the one that got 148 people sick, was started by a local cleaner\. It could have been the Greeks who potentially infected the people on the move, not the other way around\.

Moria Corona Awareness Team are continuing to push back against the ridiculous lawsuit from the Greek regional authority\. In a [statement on their Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/MoriaCoronaAwarenessTeam/photos/a.120666896229156/141605620801950/?type=1&theater) , they repeated that this was a misunderstanding and when they discussed conditions on the Greek side of the island versus Moria, they just wanted to draw attention to the difference in living conditions between Greek citizens and people on the move\. This is a clear attempt by the regional authority to silence a group that is doing vital work, over an error in communication or a mistranslation\.

The team has continued to do their important work despite the lawsuit by [creating a poster campaign](https://www.facebook.com/MoriaCoronaAwarenessTeam/posts/141603410802171?hc_location=ufi) to raise awareness about recycling\. They’re hoping that by increasing recycling, they can work to lessen the waste problem that’s been plaguing Moria\.

Another problem that’s been affecting Moria is increasing violence\. An Afghan man was [severely stabbed](https://twitter.com/f_grillmeier/status/1265343501027377155) in the main square of Mytilini, the latest in 13 recorded knife attacks\. This is saddening, but predictable after thousands of people have been locked up together for more than two months, with only one doctor on site after 4pm and very little security services they can turn to for help\. Unfortunately, violence often erupts when people become desperate\.

People are likely to become even more desperate as evictions are slated to begin June 1st\. To “help with congestion,” people will no longer be allowed to stay in camps or EU funded accommodation for more than a month after they receive refugee status\. More details can be found on [this flyer](https://twitter.com/katymfallon/status/1265258444107513856?fbclid=IwAR23a_0Rmq-W9Ll7frHZ3K_7_jpwuonBLrlUeYmHSw7Y9_bHRoPRlbZwXEQ) , which was put up in Kos\. There’s no plan for helping people figure out where to go or how to find housing and employment after their month is up\. Activists fear this will increase homelessness, poverty and violence\.

SERBIA
### NGOs Condemn Government’s Purchase of Razor Wire

After an open call was published on the Defense Ministry’s website, the Serbian government [finalized a contract](https://www.slobodnaevropa.org/a/ministarstvo-odbrane-sklapa-ugovor-za-zicu-oko-migrantskih-centara/30635387.html?fbclid=IwAR3ekpz7wazsCPaL3oHHl0p7hGE5o1MHc6H4yPj9v8Wv0SbJKqjGsjBCWzc) for the purchase of razor wire with the Smederevo\-based company Žica Best\. The government has been secretive about the details surrounding this purchase — Prime Minister Brnabic said that she has “no information” that the wire will be used to surround reception centers, and instructed reporters to ask the Defense Ministry directly\.

This move has been harshly criticized by Serbian NGOs, who say it is eerily reminiscent of the human rights abuses that have been going on for years in neighboring Hungary\. They pointed out that the Defense Ministry should only get involved in times of war or during states of emergency\. The coronavirus state of emergency has been lifted and the involvement of the Defense Ministry sets the precedent that people on the move should be treated like enemy soldiers\.

The use of razor wire itself is another step towards treating people on the move like enemy soldiers\. Razor wire, which is designed to maim people and is [far more dangerous than barbed wire,](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/13/a-bloody-method-of-control-the-struggle-to-take-down-europes-razor-wire-walls) has been widely condemned\.

The Belgrade Center for Human Rights filed a report against guards in the Bogovađa Asylum Center\. In a statement [published on their website](http://www.bgcentar.org.rs/bgcentar/eng-lat/bchr-files-criminal-report-against-guards-for-violence-against-unaccompanied-children-in-the-bogovada-asylum-centre/?fbclid=IwAR33UFtTzXBYawSp7E2pdSDOZwlj5wMwlWQfsX1Cu9bFaHSE7MZmScwLOOs) , they said that guards were caught on video verbally abusing and beating children that are living there, and later intimidating them to try and suppress the incident\. The center called for all children to be taken out of reception centers and placed in safer environments\.

CROATIA
### Croatia To Face European Court of Human Rights

The [European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights reported](https://www.ecchr.eu/nc/en/press-release/croatia-to-answer-to-european-court-of-human-rights/?fbclid=IwAR2uNotWQuYUrIcjTo2XhuFpPB1aaNN93Ue1mzaZBpVb3hBmWdPv6me0VEw) that the European Court of Human Rights will hear a case brought by a collective of people on the move, who were illegally pushed back to Bosnia in 2018\. This will be the first time that Croatia will have to answer for its pushback practices in front of a court\!

MALTA
### Welfare Agency Asks to Board Captain Morgan Ships

The official Maltese Agency for the Welfare of Asylum Seekers asked the government for [permission to board and assess conditions](https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/102588/asylum_seekers_welfare_agency_asks_for_access_to_captain_morgan_vessels_hosting_migrants?fbclid=IwAR2moeI7nSLNGAOh3LEyZkXdSVBSc9n3prbExm8o9SN0gUcVBUMh9KNEpJs#.Xs3IPhNKjfZ) on the Captain Morgan ships, which has not been granted yet\.

Malta’s practice of keeping people rescued at sea detained offshore on day cruise ships has been heavily criticized, especially as AlarmPhone reported that several people onboard started a hunger strike to protest their conditions\. The government’s reluctance to allow its own agency onboard to conduct an independent review is doing nothing to cast off suspicion\.

Meanwhile, Maltese businessman James Fenech is [under investigation](https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/court_and_police/102583/boats_that_carried_libya_mercenaries_lacked_permit_from_malta_sanctions_board_?fbclid=IwAR1focAT1cnrRkBeSL2dgVveXA5WLtpK8xhgh0QW4FYxnAMMPrZxJEvDssk#.Xs3IOxNKjfZ) for breaching EU sanctions and secretly chartering boats to evacuate mercenaries from Libya\. He claims that they were oil workers\. It’s ironic that mercenaries involved in a brutal civil war were rescued, but innocent civilians are left to drown in the Mediterranean\.

ITALY
### Court Agrees that Italy Is Not a Safe Port

The Lazio regional administrative court denied the organization ARCI’s request to suspend the decree stating that Italian ports are not “ports of safety” during the coronavirus pandemic, arguing that they need a proper hearing to decide on the matter because the courts need to “balance opposing interests”\. A full hearing will be held in July\.

Even during the worst of the pandemic, Italy was still a safer port than Libya, which is where most people on the move were fleeing from\. As lockdown measures across the country continue to ease, how can they justify this language about a “port of safety,” besides admitting that it is a ploy to shirk their duties to rescue people at sea?

PORTUGAL
### Portugal Rejects Over Half of Asylum Applications

Portugal accepts a fairly large number of asylum applications and made headlines a few weeks ago for agreeing to accept 500 unaccompanied minors for Greece, but how does it treat people once they actually get there? Reportedly, 67\.3% of asylum seekers are rejected initially\. Read more information \(in Portuguese\) [here](https://expresso.pt/sociedade/2020-05-25-Refugiados.-Portugal-rejeitou-673-dos-pedidos-de-asilo-que-recebeu-em-2019?fbclid=IwAR23dHlMgnqcEnrNEuagn0xS_syghR-FFjfZ7qW8-ejUuegX5LgLfiPARWI) \.

FRANCE
### France Will Accept 750 Asylum Seekers From Greece

The 750 people [that will be resettled](https://www.fr24news.com/a/2020/05/france-welcomes-750-asylum-seekers-from-greece.html) will include 350 unaccompanied minors\. Moves will begin in July after they were postponed due to the pandemic\.

However, France has also agreed to increase participation in Frontex missions and deportations\. Hopefully the 750 that are being resettled will have a chance at a better life, but how many other people will have their lives ruined by a militarized border or deportation order?

Activists in Paris need your help\! Even though donations tend to slow down after holidays, need doesn’t\. They need donations of food, clothing, blankets and more\.

NETHERLANDS
### Political Tensions Over Child Resettlement Program

The Dutch coalition party CDA, or Christian Democrat party, may have to change their strict opposition to the plan to accept unaccompanied children from Greek camps\. The NL Times reports that “ [over 40 local and provincial CDA factions”](https://nltimes.nl/2020/05/26/political-fighting-fate-orphans-greek-refugee-camps?fbclid=IwAR1SQpfZf3pfna5rAQcgdiwCcx6KK-2IX2Wj29iJ5dqp4qvoS-JUN5WedTA) called on the national party to change its mind, which it did\.

This comes after dozens of Dutch municipalities agreed to shelter the children before the national government did anything, and a similar effort in neighboring Germany\. While it’s infuriating that the fate of unaccompanied children gets tied up in political infighting, this provides some hope for the future if regular European people haven’t lost their humanity, even if high\-ranking politicians have\.

NORWAY
### Bishop of Oslo Speaks in Solidarity with Moria

In a post [on her official Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/biskopkari/photos/a.212769279320366/626399704623986/?type=1&theater) including pictures from a demonstration in front parliament, Oslo bishop Kari Veiteberg called on the government to help residents in Moria\. She asked that they resettle children from the camp and continue with previous plans that had been postponed\.
