### FEATURE — Iranian Asylum Seekers on Strike to Protest Unequal Treatment in Asylum Process

A group of Iranian asylum seekers on [hunger strik](https://iranwire.com/en/features/6719) e in Gothenburg are attempting to highlight the inequalities in Sweden\. Many have been applying for asylum for years and are criticizing the delays of the system in general, as well as discrimination against Iranians\.

Asylum seekers have to meet a very high standard to prove that they are in real danger if they go back to Iran\. Having family who were executed by the state is not enough of a reason, nor is converting to a different religion such as Christianity\. In fact, the Swedish government has accused many Christian converts of lying about their religion and in general is insensitive to the dangers Christian converts may face\. This treatment is not unique to Iranian asylum seekers as many Afghan Christians were also deported to a country where conversion is illegal\. However, the group pointed out that there seems to be a systematic denial of asylum applications from Iran\. Despite their different reasons for applying for asylum and despite whatever proof they provide, Iranian asylum seekers often get the same answer — no\.

Applicants are not provided with adequate legal representation or translation\. Sometimes, the legal counsel and translators given to them by the government are openly hostile to them, such as the case of one Iranian Christian whose translator \(a Syrian Muslim, so probably not even a native Farsi speaker\) interrogated her about her decision to convert\. Appealing a rejected asylum decision can drag through courts for years and very rarely is successful\. When asylum applicants are rejected, people lose the right to a monthly stipend, employment permits or any kind of social safety net they had and have to lead a precarious existence if they choose to stay in Sweden\. Because of this, many families are protesting not just discrimination against Iranian nationals but the drawn\-out nature of the asylum process, which makes it impossible for all people on the move to rebuild their lives\.

There is some good news coming out of Sweden: 15 people [were released](https://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/migrationsverket-slapper-asylsokande-ur-forvar-efter-ny-lagtolkning?fbclid=IwAR04zVchhwVTQ0oNVm91balzsIUxTKLQbeyz4AaHIj65bq58NiX_GC7-0m0) from the Migration Agency’s detention centers over the weekend\. This happened due to a new interpretation of the EU’s reception conditions directive, which affects all member states of the Common European Asylum System\. The directive in question is one that limits the possibility of depriving someone of their liberty, something that the Swedish government has been accused of doing to an excessive degree\. The people released were mostly those whose asylum applications were rejected but did not legally have to leave the country yet\. Previously, the Swedish government was able to justify detaining them and countless others by saying it was a preventative measure to avoid people “disappearing” before they could be deported\. Effectively they were imprisoning people for having an opportunity to commit a “crime,” but not actually committing one\.

Obviously this new interpretation is a positive one and will hopefully make life easier for people on the move in Sweden, however, the Swedish asylum system as a whole is very troubling\. The EU directive in question was passed in 2013, which means for at least seven years Sweden has been detaining people “preventatively” in a way that goes against all interpretations of human rights\.

While the Swedish government freeing 15 people that were unjustly imprisoned is a good thing, we cannot forget the many others who are being deprived of their freedom\. Sweden and other EU governments do not deprive people on the move of their liberty just by detaining them, they do so by demoralizing them with invasive asylum procedures, forcing them to live in uncertainty during application processes that last years, and otherwise taking away their ability to lead a normal life\.

SEA/SPAIN
### 14 People Killed in a Shipwreck Off the Spanish Coast

This week has already been a fatal one on the Mediterranean\. The Spanish Coast Guard is [still searching](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/22872/14-migrants-dead-dozens-missing-near-canary-islands?fbclid=IwAR0AjNEtlyXWQNN0KVDf7_a6m4QX0efvSYx9GiUvhzuZmdo0JhstetqV6Kg) for three boats that were reported missing by Alarm Phone\.

We have more information about the shipwreck that killed 14 people that Alarm Phone \(and Are You Syrious\) [reported](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1229757447839059969?s=20) on yesterday\. There were 28 people in total on board before it capsized\. Most were from Guinea and the Ivory Coast\. Tuesday, the Spanish Coast Guard rescued 16 people from another shipwreck\.

Of the 14 boats in total Alarm Phone has reported on in the past four days, [six](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1230210268296306694?s=20) were turned back to Libya\. Some people who were returned to Libya informed Alarm Phone that they were denied food and water, imprisoned, and tortured\. In their [own words](https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1230231655060819978?s=20) , the EU governments are complicit:


> Libya continues to lock people up\. Europe is complicit in the suffering of foreigners in Libya\. European aircrafts spotted us & called the Libyans to arrest us\. We are living in fear, in this hell that is Libya\. We have to get out of here even if it costs our life\!

Last night, a group of about 50 people arrived in Bihać from Serbia\. They arrived at the doorstep of Bira camp and asked for assistance there, but it seems that they have not received any help\.

[This group](https://www.facebook.com/1245970425495921/photos/a.1266360583456905/2795660523860229/?type=3&theater) will probably become part of the growing number of people sleeping rough in the outdoors and in abandoned buildings, even through Bosnia’s bitterly cold winters\. There are only a few volunteers to help them and they are in desperate need of assistance that humanitarian organizations have not really provided\. People need food, clothing, shoes, blankets, curtains, sleeping bags and medicine\. We will update if we get information about how to donate remotely\.

Already there are 2,000 people living in Bira camp, of which 500 are minors\.

EU
### EU Under Fire for Libyan Naval Mission

EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell [explained](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/human-rights-groups-criticise-eu-over-libyan-naval-deployment-1.4177931?mode=amp&fbclid=IwAR3LVkTcwr9z8MVjsST03FseQTZWY_0i_R_FH-jAaJerBg9BIYjYndUVs00) that the organization will deploy ships on the Mediterranean to make sure the Libyan arms embargo is being followed but will withdraw the ships if it seems as if they are becoming a “pull factor for migrants\.” In layman’s terms, this means the ships will not rescue people in distress, leaving them to die in the sea in the hopes it will discourage other people on the move\.

Judith Sunderland, an associate director for Human Rights Watch, called the policy “a craven disgrace\.” She went on to explain that the EU has the capacity to enforce the embargo and carry out rescue missions at the same time so this is not a question of resources, but a deliberate choice to let people die\. The EU has not had an organization\-wide rescue policy since Operation Sophia ended last March\. For almost a year, ships in distress in the Mediterranean have relied on the goodwill of individual countries’ coast guards or private, NGO rescue ships\. This new plan, Operation EU Active Surveillance, shows that the EU does have vast naval resources, it just doesn’t have the political will to stop killing people at its borders\.
