**State refugee councils and PRO ASYL demand equal treatment for all refugees from Ukraine**

On the occasion of the Conference of Ministers of the Interior in Würzburg from 1–3 June 2022, PRO ASYL and the State Refugee Councils as well as many other organisations and initiatives demand a nationwide regulation that guarantees the protection of all refugees from Ukraine and an immediate stop to discrimination against third\-country nationals and stateless persons from Ukraine\.

According to the [Ukraine Residence](https://www.bundesanzeiger.de/pub/publication/jPaah7D7T0xoPuPKr2Z/content/jPaah7D7T0xoPuPKr2Z/BAnz%20AT%2003.05.2022%20V1.pdf) Transitional Ordinance, all people from Ukraine are allowed to stay in Germany until August 31st\. This is intended to give them the opportunity to either apply for temporary protection or to meet the requirements for other residence\-related purposes\. However, the latter is hardly possible for many refugees in the short time available\. In the long term, there is a risk that people will find themselves in precarious living conditions, the press release states\. Read it in full [here](https://www.proasyl.de/pressemitteilung/landesfluechtlingsraete-und-pro-asyl-fordern-die-gleichbehandlung-aller-gefluechteten-aus-der-ukraine/?fbclid=IwAR1y3wf28wfWiHfy66nCS7P5bJU9JAgHRUUcpI6fVvoiS3NUklk5jPXibIQ) \.
#### TURKEY

Syrian refugees in Turkey are worried about Erdogan’s plans to relocate up to one million of them to “safe areas” inside Syria\. Damascus is also unhappy, fearing a Turkish landgrab and the return of dissidents\.

As we [previously reported](ays-digest-11-5-22-2-500-asylum-seekers-and-refugees-being-held-in-prolonged-inhumane-detention-a882087ec876) , the Turkish president said he would not send the Syrians back to their war\-torn country, but now the Turks seem to be bragging about having “cleared out” zones in Syria where it’s “safe for the people to return”\. More reactions in the [media](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dw.com%2Fen%2Fsyrian-refugees-in-turkey-turn-into-a-political-pawn%2Fa-61915356%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0bx2jPX-7VQcpzqWIzSmjbMtqU9bNwXfloZjS8jZ8hyjfKa4HBoIKQUG0&h=AT2A4w-mtSxDuqPhLU4xXYswqK4sWGOWp6tQLkX16bEjN9GVzgFnOv_6kkNy2w6ZpkNCqu5LB3WuYy4A2H5PohxOBI9KO3p7hzMQLhxXpCph_2CfYwv8mVjM1fu3qYz91zv1vsrQbg5RuWmKUaFlJgDSuOcliA&__tn__=R]-R&c[0]=AT1eRg8W9fLxmWWaMSovdeYtcwBKNqLgGJvG3imuR9APsrTA1KnLmpxTL0IFDQgPqZ--4RQG2Me4BGCUV4bmehoiMVWy_5jAYlADJUyDXnF7oeGy6Kw9J57vTYRDvPM7hBgX7dQnM6K3NlVE3rOh4kZ3qoOcGZoiVzhmVkjCbA44vttN0N8eqBKauGdJnVCTaUx6YgWdjaIr) reports\.
#### SEARCH AND RESCUE AT SEA

The court of Trapani excluded Amnesty International, ECCHR Berlin, European Association of Lawyers for Democracy & World Human Rights, and [Giuristi Democratici](https://mobile.twitter.com/giurdem) from observing the preliminary hearing in the case of the four members of the Iuventa crew accused of facilitating irregular migration for saving thousands of people at sea\.

Amnesty [expressed](https://t.co/enSo92vjjt) concern about this criminal investigation when it became known and wanted to monitor this trial from the start, including the preliminary hearing\.

### Over 300 people on board Ocean Viking

**Activists saved the lives of another 64 people in the central [Mediterranean](https://thecivilfleet.wordpress.com/tag/Mediterranean/) , just a day after they prevented the [EU\-supported Libyan coast guards](https://thecivilfleet.wordpress.com/2021/03/05/eu-urged-to-continue-support-for-libyan-coastguard-in-leaked-document/) from intercepting over 70 refugees\.**


> The survivors were given first aid and then escorted to the Ocean Viking, which had already rescued 158 people from two overcrowded rubber boats in Libya’s SAR zone last Thursday\. 





> SOS Mediterranean said the survivors from that rescue had been at sea for nine hours, and that some of them were being treated for heat exhaustion and emotional distress by the Red Cross medical team\. 





> The survivors later told the Ocean Viking’s crew that one of their number had gone missing a few hours prior to their rescue\. Five people had fallen off the boat, but only four had managed to swim back to their unseaworthy vessel\.

### GREECE

Another emergency was reported in the Evros region\. Alarm Phone teams were informed about a group stranded in the forest near Soufli\. Reportedly, one person was in critical condition [from a snake bite](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.efsyn.gr%2Fellada%2Fdikaiomata%2F345312_se-katastasi-kindynoy-apo-dagkoma-fidioy-syros-prosfygas-ston-ebro%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1XLawTvNAhL4_uu7hARvwgstPJCRqn_H__WRTVHyc6m8J7wUzC7j_eIV4&h=AT20SUOHJgbxcIWOOv-Qi2FqJfR5oofnqRtuSSr7I_mvMc2TWlV_b4XFu5DqwHPf1pAI_kML-Lgl1FEx3P_01FYfO9k9nBEZ_OAUqyfRv_WoJneSR8fRBnB3mKnbHH0vBDKaSV9w5Ze8Bf3eT53TfZ3z3--0nw&__tn__=R]-R&c[0]=AT3ZM2UmCVgf5BmGvXtdECeFW_HGUtjYsj0DX5GStO-p_cA4EYo_5xwbpPuQJGOBEnd4hBouYVgxr458oO7GmakNMqTlNqZaBCJQjVG8py0JEczf40SQfVSs-f3tpAniaQCLNbrvj38HzatcwyA8rcjqWrnain4bRIXwu6MT54RjTc1mghyPgxlSj0qMIGGCUq71cC3GliZy) \.

Authorities were informed, but at the time of reporting no help had arrived\. Immediate rescue was needed\. Comments on the lack of a reaction were quicker:

The mountainous areas around Soufli are indeed remote and there aren't many villages there, but they're not exactly the Olympos mountain, and there are roads and paths in the area.

At the same time, the country openly warned \(on Tuesday\) that it would “not allow the illegal entry of migrants by land or by sea”, after a sharp increase in attempted entries over its Aegean islands and the land border with Turkey over the past few days, as reported in our SAR section\.

### From sea to prison\. An interview on the criminalisation of so\-called traffickers

On issues related to Article 12 of the Consolidation Act on Immigration, the 20\-year\-long criminalisation at a political and media level of the so\-called ‘scafisti’ \(traffickers\) and the lives of migrants who end up in prison for aiding and abetting illegal immigration, we interviewed Richard Brodie, an activist of the Arci Porco Rosso in Palermo\. The activists and researchers of the Sicilian section of the association produced and published in October 2021 a report which, through elaborate investigative work, tries to encourage a national debate on these issues\.

The waiting time is more than a year\. Especially for women travelling alone, it is difficult to leave Afghanistan at all\.
#### POLAND

Shocking footage from the Polish\-Belarusian border\. Shows how migrants are being treated by Belarusians\. And what people face when being pushed back from Poland\. People entering from Belarus are victims of a brutal regime and must be protected, the Polish human rights lawyer reports:

At the Border Guard post in Białowieża, refugees crossing the Polish\-Belarusian border were to wait for the results of coronavirus tests in a garage — on a concrete floor, where old and dirty mattresses were spread\. There was a table and a few chairs, a water bowl and two portable toilets outside\. It is possible that the refugees have also been here in other situations and for a long time\.
