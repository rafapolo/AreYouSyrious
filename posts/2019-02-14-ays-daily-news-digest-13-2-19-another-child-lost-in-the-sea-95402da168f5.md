#### FEATURE

A girl is missing, by now presumably deceased, after a boat carrying 52 people was approaching Greece — Tsonia, Lesvos north east\. In high waves and wind some of the passengers fell overboard when the boat crashed into some rocks\. When the passengers got on land, it was discovered that she was missing, as she was allegedly not wearing a life jacket\. 51 people arrived, [Aegean Boat Report](https://www.facebook.com/AegeanBoatReport/?__tn__=%2CdkCH-R-R&eid=ARAqiElmhAoU9ciubZqWAlik45-Biuj3tYB2ZG-Gak-pNhcyHRyoQKby9nbP-X7U2BZUNGfGJQei5cOH&hc_ref=ARREm3dhuGTuhwIbE6cE4b7MM9epCcozPNCKsMsIg_JWAGbvJYvkKBnk1eBvSO1x1dA&fref=nf) team writes\. Rescue was alerted, and a wide search was initiated from both sea and land, without any results\. Search and rescue was canceled due to bad weather conditions, but they were to continue searching when conditions improve\.

The nine\-year\-old girl from Afghanistan who is missing was traveling with her parents and four siblings\. Survivors have already been transferred to Moria camp\.

> _Today was one of those days that we hoped never to see again on Lesvos, and one of those days that help us understand why we are still here\. In the early hours of this morning, our team responded to reports of a landing near Tsonia\. A boat carrying over 40 people had reached the island’s shores, despite the stormy conditions, but not all passengers were accounted for\. A girl of around 10 years old remains missing, after hours of searching by Refugee Rescue / ‘Mo Chara’ and authorities\._ 
 

> _More than three years after the death of Alan Kurdi shook the world, prompting empty promises of safe passage and humanitarian admission, those of us working in these border regions see that little has changed\. It is unacceptable and heartbreaking that we should still have to witness scenes like these played out on Europe’s doorstep\. —_ Lighthouse Relief

#### LIBYA

Journalist Sally Hayden who has been reporting on the situation of refugees in Libya extensively for a while now, writes that the first group of refugees who’d been stranded in Libya has landed in Niger, where they’ll stay in a UNHCR centre until another country agrees to resettle them\.

#### TURKEY

As we reported yesterday, there was a fight involving Syrians in Istanbul and we shared some of the information reported about it in the Turkish media\. However, the Research Center on Asylum and Migration \(IGAM\) has recently released a study on the coverage of refugees in the Turkish media\.

As they concluded, the news about refugees are those associated with violence and crime\. That happens despite the fact that crime levels are relatively low among Syrian refugees\. Good news is no news and therefore success stories find limited space in the Turkish press\. While refugees are the main actors in the news, their views are rarely sought and their voices are rarely heard so that they can tell their side of the story\.

Read more from a very interesting text covering this topic: [here](http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/opinion/barcin-yinanc/the-coverage-of-syrian-refugees-in-the-turkish-press-141221?fbclid=IwAR058NzakXQh2h9UNpXszaMI3JgcQxkSRLMIJ3yA4Xz20gpStT0wMbsibIo) \.
#### GREECE
### Chios

Most recent letter to the EU Commission documenting the appalling human rights abuses happening in plain sight at Vial camp on Chios:

The letter was organized and co\-signed by a number of organizations on Chios and includes the following:


> Dear Mr\. Mordue, Deputy Director General for Migration and Home Affairs: 





> “… First, it is shocking in itself that almost three years after the EU\-Turkey Statement entered into force, we are still having an exchange about the provision of even the most basic humanitarian care necessary for dignified living… This is now the third winter in which families are living in camping tents in the mud\.”
