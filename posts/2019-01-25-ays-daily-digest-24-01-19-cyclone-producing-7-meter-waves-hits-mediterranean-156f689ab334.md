#### Feature:

Five days ago the SAR vessel Sea Watch 3 rescued 47 people from a shipwreck in the Mediterranean, including 8 unaccompanied minors\. It is reported that around 100 others drowned in the incident\. Since then, the rescued group has been stranded on board the vessel, which has been prevented from disembarking on any Italian or Maltese port\. As weather conditions worsened and a rare Mediterranean cyclone that produced waves up to seven meters, Sea Watch 3 spent the day sheltering from the bad weather conditions close to the coast of Eastern Sicily\.

```
GOVERNMENT MEASURES AGAINST RIGHTS AND DIGNITY!
We have great responsibilities before us: to rebel and disobey unjust laws, to reiterate and build spaces of solidarity, to leave the social networks to meet in the streets and streets to rediscover so many * and divers *.
Open ports, borders, our cities, streets and squares because without dissent there is no democracy.
Open citizenship to present and future generations
Affirming the rescue on land and sea as an indisputable and just action.
Let us also save ourselves to remain human *!
This is why we are waiting for you on Friday 25th January at 5.00pm in Piazza Esquilino,
```

The Mediterranean is not a grave\.‚Äô Despite his words the reality is 200 people have already lost their lives at sea in 2019\.

In this time, search and rescue vessels continue to be blocked from saving lives\.

#### THE EU

European shipowners insist that the EU takes immediate action on the situation in the Mediterranean\. European Community Shipowners‚Äô Associations \(ECSA\) is disappointed with Germany‚Äôs decision to withdraw from Operation Sophia, launched by the EU in 2015 to capture smugglers and shut down human trafficking operations across the Mediterranean, as well as enforce a weapons embargo on Libya\.

Germany withdrew due to a dispute with the Italian government over their prevention of ships being allowed to dock at their ports and people being allowed to disembark\.

‚ÄòWe are very disappointed with Germany‚Äôs decision to uspend its participation in Operation Sophia\. Operation Sophia‚Äôs contribution to maritime security in the Central Mediterranean is very important‚Äô said ECSA‚Äôs Secretary General Martin Dorsman\.

> The World Refugee Council, chaired by former Canadian foreign affairs minister Lloyd Axworthy, has made [55 recommendations aimed at reversing the UN‚Äôs top\-down approach](https://www.worldrefugeecouncil.org/publications) to the issue by having a core group of like\-minded countries spearheading creative solutions and allowing them to bypass the bureaucracy of the international body\. 





Canada has taken the lead in refugee settlement for the first time in 72 years\.


> Data compiled from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \(UNHCR\), as well as other governments worldwide, shows that Canada resettled just under 30,000 refugees in 2018 ‚Äî slightly exceeding the number of those resettled by countries in the European Union, and a few thousand more than those resettled by the United States, putting Canada in a historic lead\. 





However Robert Falconer, a researcher at the U of C‚Äôs School of Public Policy has explained that Canada has established this position primarily because the U\.S\. resettlement has substantially decreased\.


> They‚Äôve gone from resettling 65 to 70 per cent of the world‚Äôs resettled refugees to only 24 per cent,‚Äù Falconer said of the U\.S\., comparing the dramatic shift in numbers from 2016 to 2018\.
