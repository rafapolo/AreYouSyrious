#### Greek Government Continues Attacks on Civil Society By Forcing Journalists to Delete Footage

Journalists from an as\-yet\-unnamed [international TV channel](https://twitter.com/Balkanizator/status/1409537696834392077) were stopped by Greek Coast Guard security in Lesvos\. The security forced them to delete hours of footage from their memory card, probably of scenes exposing the truth about border practices\.

This is far from an isolated incident\. The authorities in Greece have been ramping up harassment and intimidation of journalists and other members of civil society, such as NGOs\. There have been several incidents of authorities forcing journalists to delete footage or stopping them from freely reporting on conditions in the camps\.

Dutch journalist Ingeborg Beugel was [even arrested](https://tvxs.gr/news/ellada/mpegkel-sto-tvxsgr-gia-ti-syllipsi-tis-poinikopoiithei-i-filoksenia-tha-simanei-telos-to?fbclid=IwAR0KJoaX3pZiGzMcnOcQ-AXF1YV6ZzhIYlHo_8FW9ZFwetuiF3YHflaCktM) for hosting an asylum seeker in her home\. She is still waiting for her trial\. Legal analysts say that the law under which she was arrested is rarely applied and Beugel herself says that she was most likely targeted for her journalism, which challenges fascist actors on the island of Hydra where she lives\.

Meanwhile, tabloids and pro\-government sites freely publish misinformation, or rampant lies, about people on the move and solidarity workers\. The newspaper Parapolitika [repeated a report](https://www.efsyn.gr/node/300090) that accused supporters of the Moria 6 who protested in front of the court of arson, trafficking, and all sorts of crimes\. The “report” particularly targeted journalists and legal observers that attempted to enter the courtroom, as was their right by law\.

Amid this tightening landscape for journalists, particularly journalists that wish to publish the truth and act in solidarity with people on the move, our BVMN colleagues [disinfaux collective](https://twitter.com/disinfaux/status/1409608608761921538) are publishing a new site including analysis on the events in Nea Smyrni earlier this year\. Please support their work as their brave journalism is much needed\.
#### SEA
#### Deadly Shipwreck On the Canary Islands Route

A shipwreck [killed 40 people](https://www.publico.es/sociedad/naufragio-ruta-canaria-caminando-fronteras-alerta-muerte-40-personas-ninos-naufragio-patera-rumbo-canarias.html?fbclid=IwAR1WdFm3hAIQvH39WIz9s4SeQjdH42li_iUqrPKGDNLT_-seYykttW5CTWE) near the coast of Western Sahara who were trying to make it to the Canary Islands, according to Caminando Fronteras\. At least two children are among the dead\. 22 survivors were rescued by a Moroccan fishing boat\.

#### ITALY
#### New Tally of Solidarity Associations

As part of its update to the official Migrant Integration site, the Italian government released a full list of NGOs and associations working with people on the move as well as a map of their locations\. There are a total of [1,135 associations](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/33235/italy-updated-map-of-migrant-associations?fbclid=IwAR0Qv_37BJXRNU5QLQEBDjNRCpLx3oEoFHjl38ZiN8UqX7KhWPZpMcPyvxo) in the database\.
#### FRANCE
#### Protests in Calais Against Banning Solidarity

This year, the government passed 11 decrees stopping people from giving people on the move food or drink without actually replacing those distributions with government services\. Over the weekend, people gathered in the northern French city to [protest these measures](https://www.facebook.com/RefugeeInfoBus/posts/3038769083025166) against solidarity and human decency\.
#### AUSTRIA
#### More Information on Chain Pushbacks from Austria

The [first court decision](https://www.facebook.com/RefugeesSpielfeld/posts/2841133799480424) in the case of a chain pushback from Halbenrain, Austria to Bosnia will be released in just a few days\. However, this case is just one [among many others](https://www.wienerzeitung.at/nachrichten/politik/oesterreich/2109981-Wenn-niemand-Asyl-sagt.html?fbclid=IwAR0O0PFgs43i9qK23MllTNZ3SqvhHkWS_P7GKfX2AjzztT_cyygNuDQtsXQ) , showing the role Austria has in human rights violations on the Balkan route\.
#### BELGIUM
#### Hunger Strike Updates

[470 people](https://twitter.com/agirpourlapaix_/status/1409438398306263041?fbclid=IwAR38DAhlneHbXWQZI4VR2bRKjY4ubChRPC47R_bvWhVLjsNMs1BATZZt4Ks) are still on hunger strike in Bruxelles, protesting for legal regularization in their situation, after 36 days\. Yesterday, two people went as far as sewing their lips together\. Still, the government is not listening to their demands, let alone taking concrete action to help the people\.
#### UK
#### UK Attempting to Outsource Asylum…Again

Priti Patel will be publishing legislation that would keep asylum seekers [out of the UK](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jun/28/home-office-proposals-due-on-sending-asylum-seekers-abroad?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other&fbclid=IwAR2JIAKwoGW8SbeOGS8yb5BYhxzFREaNcowuysKaR1FDVrWd_OuSQmFYsfE) while their applications were being processed\. They would probably send people to an undecided third country, similar to the Danish proposal\. Some reports said that they were in talks with Denmark to share an offshore center, but the Home Office denied this\. Previously the Home Office wanted to keep people on the move on Ascension Island, a nearly deserted island in the Atlantic, or even offshore rigs\.

The government explicitly said it was inspired by the new Danish law that would force asylum seekers to a third country while their applications were processed\. [This article](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2021/06/denmarks-immigrants-forced-out-government-policies?fbclid=IwAR328aU3CIQH5rVhoMZWM2axpULvG5zO4vEzD_L9X6vxy0lCrAEsbNN0z3Y) outlines this policy within the government’s wider turn to the hard right\.
#### EU
#### European Cities Call For More Acceptances of People on the Move in Conference in Palermo

Late last week, a group of city representatives from across Europe signed the “ [International Alliance of Safe Haven Cities](https://www.migazin.de/2021/06/28/internationales-staedtebuendnis-fordert-aufnahme-von-fluechtlingen/?fbclid=IwAR2bv-fumyYEf51epo1JOdFL43XcUGObCTcdCFCHetdgE-UaUxirjZph_8Q) ” in Palermo\. 12 mayors met physically in Sicily while [21 others](https://twitter.com/FromSea2City/status/1408696129009639426?fbclid=IwAR1WdFm3hAIQvH39WIz9s4SeQjdH42li_iUqrPKGDNLT_-seYykttW5CTWE) joined the declaration online\. In the declaration, they called for an equitable asylum system that would give people on the move homes in different cities across the network, instead of forcing people into crowded camps and relying on a handful of Southern European countries to host everyone\. The mayor of Palermo, Leoluca Orlando, called what is happening in the Mediterranean “a genocide” and advocated for a [European civil service](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/33237/33-european-cities-sign-alliance-of-safe-harbours-declaration?fbclid=IwAR17Kewm3gc-cK-1yODkBamyx94JLDtAH8IX3wd16-EZECwqXCN1X0Na4jY) to support sea rescue initiatives\.
