#### NOTE FROM THE TEAM

**Dear Subscribers,**

For about 5 years, Are you Syrious? provided our audience with updates and news about the situation of People on the Move in Europe through our AYS Daily Digests and AYS Specials\. During this time we published more than 1000 articles\. The AYS Info Team consists of about 15 committed volunteers from all over the world, who put a lot of time and effort into the project\. In order to improve what we are doing, we would love to hear back from you: What of our work is most useful for you? What would you like to read more or less? And above all: Who are you actually?

We would love if you could take 5 minutes to [answer our survey](https://www.survio.com/survey/d/W2B7R1I4A7Q3K9L1O) and help us better understand our audience in order to figure out what is most beneficent for all of us\.

Thank you\!

your Are you Syrious? Info Team
