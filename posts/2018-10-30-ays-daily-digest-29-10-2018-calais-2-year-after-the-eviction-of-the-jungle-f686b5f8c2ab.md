#### FEATURE — Calais, 2 years after the eviction of the Jungle

Utopia56 & Grand Littoral have published a short video summarising the situation in Calais 2 years after the eviction of the Jungle, which took place at the end of October 2016\.


[![Utopia56 Calais & Grand Littoral](https://scontent.flis6-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/42830628_332823497268310_2917507044346953728_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=776239&_nc_ohc=QsikB5gmFzIAX_cue1j&_nc_ht=scontent.flis6-1.fna&oh=00_AfCGFbmG-MiYWSnSjmLkXtEAMoC65oXv8HgnfV_kduKNig&oe=639ABACB "Utopia56 Calais & Grand Littoral")](https://www.facebook.com/258099198180444/videos/332816693935657/)



> In Calais, two years after the demolition of the camp, thousands of people found themselves stuck at the border between France and the UK\. 
 

> Today, in 2018, there are more than 500 people living rough in Calais\. Among them, women, children, and unaccompanied minors\. 
 

> Their rights and dignity are constantly denied\. 
 

> The French Government does not provide adequate access to fundamental rights such as food, water, sanitation, shelter and child protection\. Hundreds of people find themselves wandering in a dangerous situation\. They are neglected by the state and face constant police pressure and daily forced evictions\. _\( [Utopia56](https://www.facebook.com/Utopia56-Calais-Grand-Littoral-258099198180444/) \)_ 





Across northern France, there are around 3,000 people sleeping rough in short\-lived makeshift camps, constantly harassed by police, who destroy their tents, take their blankets, break their phones, and are often brutally violent, as reported many times by activists and organisations working on the ground\.

Last Sunday [a Care4Calais volunteer](https://www.facebook.com/Utopia56-Calais-Grand-Littoral-258099198180444/) wrote a report on the situation \( \*names have been changed\):


> On Sunday the sky was huge and blue, and the sun was shining in Calais\. We went to a site near the hospital where around 50 or 60 displaced people sleep out of view of the French police in the overgrowth\. Most people here are Kurdish and Afghani, and I meet some Iraqis and Iranians too\. 





> \[…\] 





> Kadaar\* was a young Afghan man, he’d escaped the violence of Afghanistan and had been living in London for several years\. Not a Londoner myself, I could feel that I was frustrating him by not knowing the names of the areas that he’d lived in, and he only stopped listing places when I finally agreed that I’d heard of Wembley\. Kadaar was incredibly charming, funny, and enthusiastic\. His language was peppered with British idioms\. He’d been in the camp for a few weeks now, after leaving to visit relatives and finding himself no longer able to return to the UK\. 





> He was not alone in this sort of story\. I heard about a Pakistani man who’d spent 12 years in Glasgow working as a butcher, leaving to visit his dying dad and no longer able to re\-enter\. I spoke to Abed\*, who’d lived in the UK for 15 years\. His family are there and he enthusiastically spoke about Manchester, the city he still calls home\. I also spoke to Basir\*, an Iranian who’d arrived in the UK using a fake passport five years ago\. He swapped stories with another volunteer about the best Persian restaurants in London\. 





> The French police turned up while we were there\. They stood across the street, watching us and smoking cigarettes\. I heard stories about how the police here had taken mattresses from the asylum seekers and burned them beofore their eyes\. 





> Moska\*, an Afghan woman roughly my age, 25, told us how she had to dismantle and hide her tent at the break of dawn for fear that the police would take and destroy it\. Moska had never been to the UK before, she wants to go because that’s where her remaining family are, everyone else is dead\. 





> The last part of the day, once all the food and aid were distributed, was spent drinking tea and chatting to the asylum seekers on the meadow\. An impromptu dance circle broke out and sitting on the grass in the warm sun it seemed kind of idyllic, like a family picnic\. Except for the police watching us closely\. I sat with Abed and drank black tea sweetened with honey\. I asked him what he was going to do later, and he said he might do what he does often on clear days like today, and that was go to the beach at night and look across the black sea, and he might just see the sparkling lights of home twinkling in the distance\. 





Temperatures are now dropping fast, Care4Calais is [in need of winter clothes and money](https://www.facebook.com/Utopia56-Calais-Grand-Littoral-258099198180444/) \.
#### **Updates from Dunkirk**

[VZWGent4Humanity Refugee Support](https://www.facebook.com/BelgiumGent4Humanity/posts/2147742438876904?hc_location=ufi) were in Dunkirk this weekend to provide first aid\.


> Yesterday in Dunkirk the rain came down heavily for most of the day and we did what we could for the hundreds of refugees who had either returned after the eviction, or just arrived\. There were no tents to be seen, the police had made sure of that, and many were cold, wet, and desperate\. It was one of those very hard days where we ignored how wet and cold we were because we could dry off and get warm\. They couldn’t\! A young Kurdish family came to us with a little nine\-year\-old girl who had a high fever\. We gave her medication but could do nothing to heal her frightened eyes…\.we met three young boys between the age of fourteen and sixteen\. They were shivering with cold\. Refugees were pleading with some of our guys to give them their gloves, and many were worried they had no sleeping bag or blanket\. We stayed until late in the afternoon when the rain turned even heavier, making it impossible to do anything else but stop\. \[…\] 






> Evictions do not work\! \! We see the results time and time again\. And now we wonder how many more will be sick as the weather deteriorates\. 





> Humanity is lost in France, and has been for far too long\! 



### LEBANON/TURKEY
#### **Six people died at the border**

[Harekat report](http://harekact.bordermonitoring.eu/2018/10/27/refugee-camps-flooded-6-dead-as-heavy-rains-hit-lebanon-turkey/?fbclid=IwAR0_bDFzdGO827HhYmosJv6Q3RsMOsM36YnUuW1CuokFSCu9JatiYz0cdYo#more-3241) that six refugees died over the weekend at the Turkish border town of Hatay while trying to cross into Turkey despite the treacherous weather, and were subsequently swept away by flood water\.

Flooding in Lebanon and Turkey has also affected refugee camps, leaving many people homeless


> _Videos shared by member of the Syrian Negotiations Committee Hadi Albahra, reportedly from refugee camps near the Lebanese border town of Arsal, show the ground completely flooded, with tents and belongings destroyed:_

At the same time, internally displaced Syrians face worsening humanitarian conditions as winter approaches, with many severely lacking basic food and medical supplies\.

_Neighbouring countries have also been accused of neglecting management of camps in an attempt to persuade Syrians to return to their homes, which are once again under the jurisdiction of the regime\. \[…\] However, many have refused the offer due to fear of arrest and torture by the regime upon their return\._

Meanwhile, UNHCR has reported a $ 44 million shortfall in funding and was forced to suspended food rations and aid for 8,000 Syrian families in September\.

We have to ask, which bit of this is working?
### MOROCCO

> _Visiting this Monday morning at the illegal detention centre for sub\-Saharan migrants in Arekmane Nador, AMDH Nador was able to see that this youth centre is still being requisitioned by the authorities to detain migrants arrested prior to refoulement or deportation\. A bus and several cars from the ministry of the interior were stationed in front of the centre\. No one knows what’s going on inside and it still goes on\! \! \! \!_ 




### SEA
#### Updates from the Western Mediterranean

According to [local sources](https://twitter.com/alzoubeidi/status/1057000303608950784?fbclid=IwAR1aYDUJj9XNt8DHuYtehiFSpSkFqLsoIDYy5BDGLrpdenX-MERR2yvK8zw) 397 people have been picked up by the Moroccan Royal Navy — no further information available\.

In an update on the shipwreck which happened on Saturday in the western Mediterranean Sea [Infomigrants report](http://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/12964/baby-dies-in-crossing-off-spanish-coast?ref=tw) that one infant died\. The dinghy was carrying 57 people and most of the remaining people were rescued\. Among the rescued were five small children and several women\. At least one man is known to be missing, one infant required resuscitation and five people have been hospitalised in Almeria\.

### MAINLAND
#### **The implementation of the EU\-Turkey deal is an insult to human life and dignity\.**

The [Campaign for the Access to Asylum](https://asylum-campaign.blogspot.com/) published last week a statement marking their position with regard to the EU\-Turkey deal:


> The dealing with \[…\] problems which refugees face, making them victims and hostages of the preventive policy that EU member states are implementing and of the continuing tendency of banishment of the refugee issue to the fringes of Europe or even outside European borders, cannot have any other approach than: 





> \- The abandonment of the EU\-Turkey Statement and, more importantly, the abandonment of the submission of refugees in conditions of endless detention and lock\-in, that have caused all the problems we have been witnessing over the last few years\. 





> \- The reinstatement of human life and dignity in the center of political planning, in comparison to the current preventive policy and degradation of human value\. 





> \- Strategic planning for the smooth integration of refugees throughout the Greek territory, in a way that promotes coexistence with local communities, instead of making it difficult by the current policy of prevention and ghettoisation in distant camps on the mainland\. \[…\]

#### **Police agents on the Evros border arrested for people smuggling**

Two police agents stationed at the Evros border and one civilian were arrested on Monday for facilitating entry into the country of undocumented people, local media [report](http://www.ekathimerini.com/234120/article/ekathimerini/news/policemen-detained-over-charges-of-facilitating-irregular-migration?fbclid=IwAR0chCMomaVtry_BnWCBWHEEWmWL1wmw0dFiDxYmkPxWtan_cYMH23L_Vpc) \.
#### **It is now possible to renew residence permits expiring before March 31, 2019**

[Mobile Info Team for refugees in Greece](https://www.facebook.com/mobileinfoteam/) report that beneficiaries of international protection, whose residence permits expire before the [31st of March 2019](http://asylo.gov.gr/en/?p=3944) , can apply now to renew their residence permit\.

**The expiry date is written on the front side of your residence permit, directly under your name\.**

**You have to apply to renew your residence permit at least two months before it expires \(before January 31st, 2019\) \.**

This is because it can take two months until a residence permit renewal is processed\. So, if you apply for a residence permit renewal too late, then your residence permit might expire before it gets renewed\. If you are found with an expired residence permit, this might cause you trouble with the police or other authorities\.

Find more information in English [here](http://www.mobileinfoteam.org/residence-permit) , or read about it in [Farsi](http://www.mobileinfoteam.org/residence-permit-fa) and in [Arabic](http://www.mobileinfoteam.org/residence-permit-ar) \.

Volunteers at [Refugee support Europe](https://www.facebook.com/RefugeeSupportEurope) have renewed the spaces in both the LM Village, by Killini, on the mainland west coast, and in Katsikas camp, in the Ioannina area, northern Greece\.

#### **Support needed and volunteer opportunity**

The Greek Forum for Refugees is looking for community interpreters / cultural mediators\. If you’re interested and have a very good knowledge of the Greek language and a good level of Urdu, Farsi / Dari, Arabic, French, Kurdish or other languages spoken by refugees and asylum seekers, take a look [here](https://refugees.gr/el/%CE%BA%CE%BF%CE%B9%CE%BD%CE%BF%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C%CF%82-%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%BC%CE%B7%CE%BD%CE%AD%CE%B1%CF%82-%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%BB%CE%B9%CF%84%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%BC%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C%CF%82/?fbclid=IwAR3n7vYnRkeY1sfsGw2NLFwU-F2nwUWCAyu0ZxtQrriqVHTWe63czth1Kvc) \.

![Where is our International Protection? \(Photo by [Rifugiati di Via Scorticabove](https://www.facebook.com/scorticabove) \)](assets/f686b5f8c2ab/1*r_M9CrQVJ54a_lO0Wab3YQ.jpeg)

Where is our International Protection? \(Photo by [Rifugiati di Via Scorticabove](https://www.facebook.com/scorticabove) \)

As we reported in the past months, a group of around one hundred [Sudanese people](https://www.facebook.com/scorticabove/?tn-str=k*F) was evicted from their self\-managed house last July\. After having set up a makeshift camp in front of the building, they were evicted for a second time on 3rd October, as the Roman Council abruptly stopped negotiations started in July\.

Now they are dispersed, living rough wherever they find shelter\.

Fundraising was set up to support them\. There are five days left to reach their goal\.

Help them [here](https://buonacausa.org/cause/rifugiati-sudanesi?fbclid=IwAR1By6n7dVusTK6K0K5BoDWOJn9qB0bjSs_mwJ4PP55NOaAQqKy2ZDUepIQ#.W8g5bB2DCag.facebook) \.
#### “ **Amend the decree to safeguard the right to healthcare”**

A group of humanitarian organisations wrote an [open letter](https://www.asgi.it/asilo-e-protezione-internazionale/immigrazione-decreto-sicurezza-salute/?fbclid=IwAR27Xzb6HhNcpo6iseMmQ2fofpZ_8UdzZ0xvG9Ox-kgAibdAqhWPsz-dv1Y) to the Italian Parliament expressing severe concerns regarding the impact on the right to healthcare of migrants, asylum seekers and refugees of the Immigration and Security decree recently approved by the government\.

As they point out:
- The repeal of the humanitarian residence permit will increase the number of people forced into irregular and informal situations, increasing their health risks\.
- The new decree is highly unclear about the criteria used to approve permits for serious health problems, limits their duration, and stops them for being converted into work or other kinds of permits\.
- The reform of the SPRAR reception system is highly worrying, as it is now accessible only to beneficiaries of international protection and the new “special cases permits”\. As a consequence, asylum seekers are now excluded from this system and will be forced into the CAS \(Extraordinary Reception Centres\) for an even longer time, with serious repercussions on their physical and mental health, especially for vulnerable people\.
- Moreover, the decree increases the time of detention in hotspots and in Centres for Repatriation for people who haven’t committed any crime\. They could be forced to stay in such places for up to six months, and after that their future will still be uncertain\.



> “The safeguard of health is possible only through full access to healthcare, but also through the protection of social conditions, such as housing, income, education, work and living environment\.” 



#### **A total of 81 Syrian refugees to arrive on Wednesday via humanitarian corridors**

On Wednesday 31 October, 81 Syrian refugees will [arrive](https://www.mediterraneanhope.com/2018/10/29/profughi-nuovo-arrivo-dal-libano-con-i-corridoi-umanitari/) in Rome from Lebanon through the humanitarian corridors supported by the Comunità di sant’Egidio and the Italian Protestant Churches\.

Since 2016 around 2,100 people have arrived in Europe through these humanitarian corridors\.
### MACEDONIA
#### Migrant in jail without any evidence against him

[Help the Refugees in Macedonia](https://www.facebook.com/groups/help.mk.refugees/permalink/2206178469456880/) have released a statement about the continued detention of a migrant person known to them, who was arrested in Bosnia for the murder of five people in Macedonia\. There is no evidence against him and no record of these cases in either country\. They call for his release, an apology from the Bosnian Ministry of the Interior and an investigation by human rights groups\.
### BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
#### Update from the Bosnian/Croatian border

The border crossing at Maljevac is closed for the seventh day in a row and according to [other local sources](https://www.facebook.com/GPMaljevac/posts/891486687724373?hc_location=ufi) it will remain closed as long there are ‘migrants’ at the border\. Around 150 people are still there, waiting and hoping\.

At the same time, in Kladusa, in several places, hundreds of people are sleeping out in the open or in abandoned buildings waiting for the right moment to continue their journey\. Police are preventing them from boarding buses and from travelling to or from Bihac or Sarajevo, which is not in accordance with the existing legislation\.

Also in Velika Kladusa independent volunteers have been [documenting](https://www.facebook.com/chiara.lauvergnac/posts/10156201480824092?hc_location=ufi) police violence and dog bites\.

And No Name Kitchen [report](https://www.facebook.com/pg/NoNameKitchenBelgrade/posts/?ref=page_internal) that illegal pushbacks are still happening\. When it comes to laws in Europe these days, it’s best to know what they are, so that you can expect states to do the opposite\.
### FRANCE
#### Updates from Paris

Volunteers on the ground [report](https://www.facebook.com/sarah.fenbydixon.1/posts/1666986893406307) that temperatures are dropping in Paris while hundreds of people on the move are still sleeping on the streets\. Police harassment continues and many people who are undergoing the asylum process are facing near daily police abuse\.

Some people in the city are housed in temporary shelters, including a Red Cross Shelter at the Odeon Metro\. The Manager of this centre has now decided that everyone must vacate the premises on the morning of the 31st\. There has been no alternative accommodation offered\. This week a number of residents of the shelter releases a public statement:


> We’re not going back to the street\! 





> We are 36 refugees and asylum seekers in the Red Cross at the Odeon metro\. We are different nationalities \(Afghan, Sudanese, Malian, Chadian, Eritreans and others\) \. We call for your solidarity on 31 October 2018\. \[…\] We’re just asking for a place to sleep\. We were in danger in our countries\. We need protection and a safe place\. We ask for a lasting solution with rooms and kitchens near a subway station\. Without a written guarantee of this solution, we will not leave the centre\. 





The demonstration will be on Tuesday, October 30th at 18\.00, as well as on Wednesday, the announced day of expulsion, to help them resist at 6 am\.

There have been two suicides in the last year and increasing incidents of attempted suicide, self\-harm and hunger strikes, including [a case of one man sewing his own lips closed](https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?act=url&depth=1&hl=en&ie=UTF8&prev=_t&rurl=translate.google.com&sl=auto&sp=nmt4&tl=en&u=https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/bretagne/ille-et-vilaine/rennes/centre-retention-rennes-retenu-se-coud-levres-1520460.html&xid=17259,15700021,15700124,15700149,15700186,15700190,15700201,15700214,15700230&usg=ALkJrhhyJS_34LtgeiFUfS8UbWkEyzqArA) in August of this year\.

> On the 22nd of April more than 400 people walked from Claviere to Briancon, from Italy to France\. A spontaneous demonstration against the borders and their murderous militarisation, against the fascists of Generation Identitaire\. At the end of the march seven people were arrested, charged with “aiding irregular migration in an organised gang”\. They now risk 10 years in prison and 750,000 Euros fine\.

### NORTHERN EUROPE

UNHCR have [published a breakdown](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/documents/download/66034) of arrivals, acceptance rates, and quota commitments etc\. for the northern European states\. Sweden, which has the highest population in the area at 10\.1 million, also granted protection to the highest number of people, 26,775\. Yet the acceptance rate is only 44%\. Estonia, which granted the lowest number of positive responses in protection cases, 95, actually has a higher acceptance rate, 61%, as it is the 2nd smallest country in the region in terms of population\.
### DENMARK
#### Child deported to Thailand

[Local media report](https://www.thelocal.dk/20181029/after-child-deportations-minister-promises-to-look-over-danish-residency-laws?fbclid=IwAR3FH1zFDa8h5OmCQJpCRX5DrZKvaon0DQYgGucMYweMgMWf5ikUWJ42loE) that Integration Minister Inger Støjberg has said she will try to avoid deporting children in the future\. Unfortunately, this decision has come too late for many, including a 13\-year\-old girl named Atcharapan “Mint” Yaungyai who was living with her parents and attending 7th grade \(the correct grade for her age\) until she was deported back to Thailand for failing Immigration Board \(Udlændingenævnet\) requirements over integration\. I repeat, she is 13\.

Denmark’s Integration Law \(Integrationsloven\) took effect in 2016 and requires all children over the age of eight that move to Denmark to be assessed over their potential for integration before being granted residency\. Overall, Denmark’s policies towards both its citizens and potential citizens who come from non\-western backgrounds is increasingly worrying\. Targeting children and dividing families in this way is unacceptable and inhumane\.
