### FEATURE: On International Day of Peace, Human Rights are in Pieces

The International Day of Peace saw it’s 70th year of “celebration\.” The year marks the 70th year of the adoption of the universal declaration on human rights in 1948; in keeping with this, this year, the theme was the “right to peace\.” However, the reality behind these lovely platitudes is nothing more than horrifying\. In 2018, we see the European Union happily collaborating with those whose agendas prioritize cruelty in the name of “security\.” In Italy, activists took to the streets to condemn the Italian government which stands by silently as refugees from Darfur remain in desperate living conditions for over two months now, without institutional support\.


> “Abandoned in the name of defence of “right to private property” in open conflict with the right of these people to have a life worthy of this name and in violation of the international treaties that Italy has signed, in this case yes, exposing to international disgrace our country that doesn’t even respect the agreements it signed\.”

In Libya, the EU’s partner in “migration management”, ongoing fighting continues to scatter refugees and migrants, impeding their attempts to register and gain necessary support\. Many of these individuals were placed in detention after being intercepted at sea as sanctioned by officials around the world\.

> > Nearly four weeks after starting this thread I'm in touch with 12+ migrants &amp; refugees who were in Tripoli detention before Aug 26 fighting began, &amp; are now spread out over Libya. Many I can't share details of bc of safety. "By Mighty God power we staying alive"- one just sent me

■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 


Hayden also details that at least 450 people in detention went without food and water for four and a half days\. UNHCR and other bodies have finally stated that Libya should not be considered a safe return point for refugees, especially in light of the recent outbreak of violence, yet… silence\.

An infographic shows just how drastically policies within Italy can affect the life and death of people at sea

Proactiva Open Arms also notes that the numbers under Salvini’s policy are likely low due to the prohibition of SAR operations at the Libyan sea boundary\. Additionally, EU observer notes that individuals who were members of the Libyan coast guard and who were refused life\-saving training are back at work, with some of them most likely complicit in people smuggling themselves or serving as members of militias\. This catastrophic situation is one that is being happily funded and supported by the “defenders of human rights” who wish to externalize their borders, and, in so doing, push their consciences even further\.

How long will we pay lip service to the platitudes of peace and stand idly by, sanctioning the abuse of people within the system, and the persecution of people who, fearing for their lives and dignity, avoid the system\. Again we are reminded of the cries of people, NGOs, human rights organizations, and other groups about the horrific conditions in Moria, on Chios, and [on the mainland](ays-special-from-athens-we-were-forced-to-go-illegally-a002cf09990f) faced by refugees in Greece\.

If the entire argument around these International Days and declarations is to raise awareness…where in the end is the action? “Knowing is the first step\.” We think that by now, most people, at least most agencies and governing bodies involved in sustaining or changing these systems, know\.

They know, but they simply do not care\. Or worse yet, they actually give their tacit approval\. Although universal declarations can be a useful first step, if further steps aren’t taken, in some ways does this not indicate that human rights have taken a step \(or dozen\) backward? After all, there is no more excuse of “we didn’t know\.” Instead, we now know, and are, through our inaction, choosing “yes\.” We hope that the public will reach a tipping point soon in the face of this grotesque hypocrisy\.

Peace does not mean pacified, and a peace that comes at the cost of human lives and dignity is no peace at all\.
### MOROCCO

AMDH Nador has been monitoring ongoing returns of individuals from Morocco to Cote d’ Ivoire\. They report that not only are the police of Cote d’Ivoire complicit with the returns, that prior to deportation, the phones of all those taken were seized and “emptied of all contents\.” The phones were later returned\. Additionally, the deportation of women and children continue, with at least 45 being sent back yesterday\. Follow [AMDH Nador](https://www.facebook.com/pg/AmdhNador/about/?ref=page_internal) for more details\.
### SEA

Salvamento Maritimo rescued nearly 200 people yesterday in the waters around Spain\. The Aquarius rescued 11 people and will keep them onboard until they have clear guidelines on how to disembark the people to safety\. The catch\-22 of the SAR situation in the Med is summed up neatly below:


■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 
> **[Matteo Villa](https://twitter.com/emmevilla) @ Twitter Says:** 

> > Last night, Italy answered #Aquarius 2's request for a place of safety for disembarkation.

Again, the paradox:

(a) JRCC #Libya coordinates, but #migrants should not be disembarked there;
(b) other countries refuse disembarkation on the grounds of not having coordinated rescue. https://t.co/cRZ1RGfWa9

### GREECE

According to **Aegean Boat Report** , these are the Arrivals for yesterday:


> 47 People to Samos
 

> 35 people off Kos \(unclear their destination\)
 

> 30 to Lesvos
 

> 10 to Chios 





> That means 102 people all told\. 




The first 100 from Moria camp have left for the mainland\. After the ongoing outcry about the horrific living conditions and conflict in Moria, the decision to relocate 3000 people to the mainland is finally being realized\. The new camp will be located near Thessaloniki, in Volvi, and has a capacity for 1400 people\. The goal is to move 2000 people by the end of September, and the remaining 1000 over the following weeks\. Read more [here](http://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2018/09/21/moria-camp-lesvos-asylum-seekers-relocation/) \. Note that Moria \(with a capacity for 3000\) currently holds around 9000 people\.

### BOSNIA

People continue arriving to Bosnia from the direction of Serbia and Montenegro\. Some of them are coming from Greece after crossing the land border; some were in Bulgaria or Serbia for a long time, and now want to try one again to reach Europe\. All over Bosnia, citizens are coming out to help \- in small villages, as well as towns and cities\. One of the cities where more and more people are stopping, before continuing to Sarajevo or Bihac, is Tuzla\. People in the city organize through the Facebook page “ [Izbjeglice dobrodošle u Tuzlu](https://www.facebook.com/groups/459851131106164/?__xts__[0]=68.ARBB5UuT5J8Z3qvlsngoe3k22fwJlPJv3mxxASQ93LEh2rWqJRdelwv9RonvVOwxkRDKWsZKZLEesIqfHsoVkbkMEQOwB1uH_jb3kU51TZOhg46fgv9a4_g2jQ4JlrCslaLh5WETF5xZNv2Kw1cz20HPEdvAJXPwcOgc7o3DmbU0wOlGOOeFRA&__tn__=HH-R) ” \(“Refugees welcome to Tuzla”\): they try to provide basic support for those who stop in the town\.

### FRANCE

As people are still reeling from the ongoing, systematic displacement of people from unofficial camps across France, aid groups are struggling to keep up\. Here are some appeals for how you can help\.

[Solidarithe](https://www.facebook.com/solidarithe/photos/a.1758358921148889/2109108202740624/?type=3) in Paris needs a new hot water boiler\!


> Help us spread the positivi\(tea\) ❤️☕😛🌏✊ 





> We have had some time out to reassess and reset ourselves and we are now ready to tackle the winter months\! 





> The storage closing means we are now doing mobile distributions,it is hard to tell exactly how many refugees are on the streets but we estimate roughly 700\. We are currently printing useful information for refugees and making tea and coffee where we can\. We did sadly lose some of our equipment after our HQ closed and we urgently need a hot water boiler to make tea and coffee for people arriving and sleeping on the streets in Paris\. 





> Tea and coffee might not seem like much but it can really help someone feel a bit more human in precarious times, and it is a big part of what we do and the service we provide\. 
 

>  Anyone who has an urn floating around — catering companies, etc\. \. WE NEED this, we would be hugely appreciative if you could share this post or if you know anyone that can help\! \! 





FAST, Calais \(A medical group\) is in need of volunteers\!

### GERMANY

According to Enough is Enough, there were at least two fascist demonstrations in Germany, under the watchful eye of the police\. In Dortmund, around 300 people in two marches took to the streets with little to no police presence, as police were more focused on the Hambacher Forst protests\.

In Chemnitz, where around 2,500 people were marching, a journalist was attacked, and members of Die Linke were chased down\. Although police did monitor and review the damage done to an office, their message was mostly focused on what “provoked” the individuals to violence\.
