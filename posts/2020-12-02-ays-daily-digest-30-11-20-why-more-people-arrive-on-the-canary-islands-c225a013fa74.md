### Spain

In an article, [NRC\.nl](https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2020/12/01/marokkanen-kiezen-nieuwe-route-a4022239?utm_source=NRC&utm_medium=whatsapp&fbclid=IwAR3sO4GW6WlKYSWPYX8fcMzfsC7kPmenidE_yMLzHci9lntdX7KHO84IYCI) explains the reasons for the increased number of people arriving on the Canary Islands\. According to the newspaper, Morocco suspended an agreement with Spain to take back undocumented people due to the pandemic\. With income losses because of no tourism and a bad olive harvest, the situation for many people in Morocco has worsened — additionally especially the rural areas are hit by the Coronavirus\. With a higher focus on the conflict in the Western Sahara, the coastguard is not currently being prioritised by authorities, making it easier for the people to start their 1500 kilometer long journeys by boat\. After arriving on the islands, their next goal is the Spanish mainland\. “In recent weeks, quite a few have managed to board a plane from here to Spain with their passport\. There are no figures for that\. That goes through the mesh of the net,” says a spokespoerson for the spokesperson for the Spanish Commission for Refugee Assistance \(CEAR\) \.

However, for the first time the Spanish government has authorized the transfer of 50 people to Barcelona\. At the same time, officials underlined that there will be no mass relocations to the mainland\. Today, 130 people arrived on Gran Canaria; the average number of arrivals since November is 256\.

According to Civicus, the Interior Ministry has [prevented](https://monitor.civicus.org/updates/2020/12/01/protests-over-covid-19-measures-amid-second-wave-red-flag-raised-over-social-media-proposal/?fbclid=IwAR3gyzRK3dDFYQzu6-IPanaywkl4j9q0hGzXgVRao08JPR-GIgzWLeIWJU4) journalists from covering the arrival of people\. This comes along with news from [InfoMigrants](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/28836/spain-closes-controversial-dock-camp-for-migrants-on-gran-canaria?fbclid=IwAR2XuSs6iQGxHmYQAiV2EYhBrePRTelnKhj80zrTJ2LMCBUJnj4u7KQ55O4) , that the tent camps at the harbor docks have been removed and transferred to other facilities\.

### Greece

Refugee Support Aegean published a [new report](https://rsaegean.org/en/moria-2-0-trapped-refugees-at-the-mercy-of-winter/?fbclid=IwAR11eTHTqF24Mg-wKwHBwetRFqLwd0DFUOVGotWPCv98DBbXz0W1FOpUx7o) on the conditions in the new camp in Moria, highlighting that every third resident is a child\. People were struggling with decreasing temperatures, power cuts and a lack of sanitary facilities and hot water\. Although the camp was supposedly designed for 10,000 people, it is already overcrowded with less than 8,000 people\. Vulnerable groups were not properly protected and the legal access is criticized\. Furthermore, there is a general lack of activities and things to do for residents\.

Viktoria Solidarity have received a message from a resident of Eleionas Camp, who reported that he was attacked in his tent and that neither the camp security nor the police showed any care\. “They don’t pay attention to my situation\.” They also speak about police violence during evictions from Plateia Victoria\.

### England

Several public figures have launched a campaign against the deportation of 50 people to Jamaica, which is scheduled for Wednesday, writes [InfoMigrants](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/28845/stoptheflight-public-figures-and-campaigners-urge-uk-government-to-halt-deportation-flight-to-jamaica?fbclid=IwAR2zV3TGqlAMXk4i9Cc8AmDfUp8i57O9fhCW9AxSUYmAEBypwzaajstrZkg) \. The signatories of the open letter and their supporters highlight that many of the 50 people lived in the UK since their childhood and returning to Jamaica might not be safe for them\. An investigaition of previous deportations showed that “at least five deportees were killed“ after their deportation to Jamaica between March 2018 and May 2019\. The Home Office argues that the people were “dangerous foreign criminals”\.

In a verdict, the Equality and Human Rights Commission \(EHRC\) has confirmed the Windrush scandal in the UK\. Regarding the scheduled deportation, many referred to the illegal practices, when British citizens were deported because of their Carribean origin\. The EHRC “adds to the picture of a bureaucracy that either did not know or did not care that it was breaking the law”, The Guardian [summarizes](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/01/ehrc-report-home-office-trampling-peoples-rights-immigration-citizen-politicians?fbclid=IwAR3Op_yxKlFpdEv8dzxbPTQQG0paF6zwW2ne2gNH_eu_37j4HB0l_TsswO8) \. At the same time, more than 150 organisations [signed](https://www.antislavery.org/home-office-rough-sleeping-modern-slavery/?fbclid=IwAR2LiIZm-30zh6fJmzpU72lcmSJFn545_WldO0NVxy6CFm87L8vArFu5xx4) a letter, urging the government to revoke a new policy, which will make rough sleeping a reason for the refusal of a stay permit\.

### Germany

Several organizations have [critcized](https://fluechtlingsrat-berlin.de/presseerklaerung/01-12-2020-ausreiseaufforderung-und-abschiebungsandrohung-fuer-unbegleitetes-9-jaehriges-kind-aus-moria/?fbclid=IwAR15xxB03sn-kkBgpthaABRgqAb-KS1wUbXXRNzTfLpHHfSY00bqzNH8SVU) the Berlin State Office for issuing a request to leave with a deportation threat to a nine year old child from Afghanistan, who is unaccompanied and was relocated from Moria in May this year\. Even though the state office is allowed to make such decisions, \(despite the leave or a deportation being impossible\), the Refugee Council Berlin criticizes this practice\. The practice creates pressure and deterrence instead of integration — and was daily practice in Germany’s capital city\. They further criticize that minors were undergoing identification services, which they need to sign — even if they are by law not able to act\.
### Denmark

According to IOM, more than half of the tents donated for Moria by the Danish government did not arrive on Lesvos yet but are stored in Athens\. Volunteers report that 20 out of 50 tents were set up, but were not suitable for long\-term accomodation\. On Tuesday evening there was a hearing in the Danish parliament about it, according to [Berlingske](https://www.berlingske.dk/internationalt/minister-lovede-at-hjaelpe-efter-doedsbrand-i-moria-lejren-over?fbclid=IwAR0hZQqru0v2nAVFfnOssFeoaQuRbPpKJvp3_8_AQF076N1IPtEz2WpYAuc) \. In this round, Danish minister for immigration and integration, Mattias Tesfaye, suspected without providing any evidence, that a group of residents was responsible for the fire\.
### EU

Speaking at the EP Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs \(LIBE\), Frontex head Fabrice Leggeri said, Frontex officials were not involved in six pushbacks reported by Der Spiegel and Bellingcat\. After the hearing, several members demanded his resignation\. The full session can be watched on the [EP website](https://multimedia.europarl.europa.eu/en/committee-on-civil-liberties-justice-and-home-affairs_20201201-1345-COMMITTEE-LIBE_vd?fbclid=IwAR1QdMMxQ6qiJpXFZ2GEYTzhcNZhyRojdy6THGxbzbroACUSqx3_hS9xOkg) , following an analysis of the hearing:
