While governments did not act, citizens in several cities stood up to show solidarity\. Report: Frontex wants to reinforce its presence in Greece\.

### Feature: Humanity has fallen

Today we have been shocked by the events which happend in Aleppo\. Through social media we witnessed live how Assad’s troops recaptured, not to say invaded, the rebel\-held parts of the city\. Fights there were ongoing since 2012\.

Already in the night and early morning residents sent out their goodbye and SOS messages to the world, which had been left unanswered\. During this time [reportedly](https://www.facebook.com/Free.SyriaSalam/posts/725448500953218) already 180 people had been executed\. “ Now we are with 100,000 civilians trapped in an area of five squared kilometres with the non\-stop bombs, shells and advancements on the ground\. In one building more than 500 people are sheltering\. People have been underground for days” the White Helmets called for help\. “ We hear children crying, we hear calls for help, but we just can’t do anything\. We’re being bombed continuously\.”

Due to bad weather conditions the bombings abated during the day\. The bad news did not\. The fights in the streets continued\. Syrian government published videos of crossing checkpoints to safer zones\. But it is unknown, what happened with them after\. Already during the last days men haven been rounded up and forced to fight for govermental \(or near\) forces\. Today UN’s human rights office [reported](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-38301629) the first executions, when 82 civilians had reportedly been killed by pro\-government forces, of whom 11 were women and 13 children, resuming the death toll could be much higher\. The streets were full of bodies\.

There have been further unconfirmed reports of women committing suicide in order not to get captured or even raped by army forces\. It was also [said](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/12/12/last-rebels-in-aleppo-say-assad-forces-are-burning-people-alive.html) , that troops burned the remained residents alive and mass executions begun\. All of this would be war crimes\.


With the recapture of Aleppo the war in Syria did not end\. It has just reached a new peak level\. There are already [reports](https://twitter.com/NRC_Egeland/status/806862656124649473) of heavy bombings in other cities, some of them besieged\. And now the regime know it can do whatever it wants without having to fear consequences\. “What’s happening in Aleppo, will follow the world for years\. \[…\] The concept of responsibility to protect \[…\], to prevent ethnic cleansings, is over after Aleppo”, Christoph Sydow [commented](http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/aleppo-kriegsverbrechen-lohnen-sich-kommentar-zu-syrien-a-1125642.html) for Spiegel Online\.

Nevertheless worldwide solidarity was raising its voice today\. In several cities citizens stood up to protest against the war crimes happening in Aleppo\.
