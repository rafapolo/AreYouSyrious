### Unaccompanied minors in Paris left living on the street

Some of them have been there for four months\. They are people left on the street, forgotten and invisibilized, who have nowhere to sleep but that street, between two bridges\. They are from Palestine, Afghanistan, Liberia and other places\. They are people who don’t matter so much where they come from, but who are not welcomed by the French state\. They are unaccompanied minors under appeal to the courts in Paris, Créteil and Bobigny\.

Having nowhere to go, many of them had settled in the Bastille camp, soon, however, evicted for “sanitary” reasons\. After a quick interview they were sent away and left with no other shelter: many decided to move between the two bridges along the nearby road, where their health is not protected and the noise is constant\. They live now in extremely dangerous conditions, on either side of a freeway connecting to the highway\.

They are minors seeking a dignified life\. Child protection is not guaranteed as [Les Midis du Mie](https://www.facebook.com/lesmidisdumie/posts/pfbid02X24YzwuqedFwSErPNVUdnHt6rXBuszSxWgBP6mysbnJEVDUPbY785eWysycS25Unl) denounces the need for urgent action\.
#### SERBIA
### Families have been separated at Sombor camp

> “What if the police came and arrested me for sleeping outside the camp, how could I prove I was there with my family? That’s why we came here to squat\. The conditions are bad, but at least we are all together\.” 





Family unity is not guaranteed in the Sombor camp where the men of the family are separated and forced to sleep outside the camp, [reported Klikaktiv](https://www.facebook.com/klikaktiv/posts/pfbid0exVYNcmq685ALDfFDXyDBZNVEcu8L2VnzyJWAYedCHEu4gcVoeTiTpD6VMsLHa9Zl) \.

The numbers of people in transit in Serbia are increasing, particularly families, unaccompanied minors and single women\. We discussed this in the [14/10 Digest](ays-news-digest-15-10-22-frontex-covered-up-human-rights-violations-and-illegal-refoulements-7d5891322b25) \.
#### CROATIA
### People on the move arriving in Croatia have no institutional support or shelter

People seeking asylum are sleeping on the street in Croatia\. Via: [Tinka Ines Kalajzic](https://www.facebook.com/tinka987/posts/pfbid033AdEX6cVcViKP9zBx6RCvjcSULLBDTZXoRFymqCLLR6wrFPYunpFHgx9F1JtmZJ1l)

People arriving in Croatia receive a document urging them to leave the European economic area within a few days\. However, they have nowhere to stay\. Some are passing through, others want to stay, but the conditions are the same: they have no access to care or a warm place to rest\. The situation is becoming particularly difficult in Zagreb and Rijeka\.

At the moment there is no response from institutions\. [Only volunteers](https://www.facebook.com/tinka987/posts/pfbid033AdEX6cVcViKP9zBx6RCvjcSULLBDTZXoRFymqCLLR6wrFPYunpFHgx9F1JtmZJ1l) and grassroots associations take care of these people in need\. They, however, call for a systemic solution to prevent people from being left on the streets in the cold and in this vulnerable situation\.

The health of these people who have nowhere to sleep but the street depends on the volunteers who support them\. M [edical help](https://www.facebook.com/tinka987/posts/pfbid033AdEX6cVcViKP9zBx6RCvjcSULLBDTZXoRFymqCLLR6wrFPYunpFHgx9F1JtmZJ1l) is absolutely necessary for this now\.
#### SWEDEN
### Expectations on migration policies following the new government in Sweden

As a result of the cooperation agreement between the new parties in Sweden, stricter immigration policies are expected\. Sweden Democrats is a far\-right party that participated in the formation of the new government as a “supporting party\.”

Restrictive measures will likely be taken on migration and asylum, promoting the “return” of refugees to the country as well as deterrence measures against the arrival of new people
