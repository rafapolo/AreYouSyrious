### Syria

All 15 members of the U\.N\. Security Council [voted](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AuXg1jmgwXbSM9sFTLZAUUsmCmK31DK5/view) unanimously for a 30\-day ceasefire in besieged East Ghouta today for a “durable humanitarian pause”\. Urged by Kuwait and Sweden, the Council expressed outrage “at the unacceptable levels of violence escalating in several parts of the country, in particular in the **Idlib Governorate** and **Eastern Ghouta** but also **Damascus City** , including the shelling of diplomatic premises and attacks on civilians, civilian buildings and medical facilities, further compounding suffering and displacing large numbers of people”\. The aim is to deliver humanitarian aid and conduct medical evacuations of critically sick and wounded people\. Further the UN demands weekly access for humanitarian convoys\.

Security Council decisions are binding, all member states are obliged to accept and carry out the resolutions that pass\. Similar ceasefire agreements have often been violated by the warring parties after several days\. Additionally, the ceasefire does not impinge on military operations against ISIS, Al Qaeda and Al Nusra Front \(ANF\), and all other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with Al Qaeda or ISIS, and other terrorist groups\.

The recent bombings of government\-backed military forces in Eastern Ghouta killed more than 520 people and left 2,500 people wounded over the last five days \(Sunday\-Friday\), as Doctors Without Borders \(MSF\) [reports](http://www.msf.org/en/article/syria-doctors-and-nurses-collapsing-medical-response-east-ghouta-reaches-its-limits) , which is, they say, “certainly an under\-estimate\. The number of facilities who managed to report is decreasing and many facilities in the area that MSF does not support have also received wounded and dead”\. On Friday alone, 58 percent of those who died were women and children\. _“There is a level of desperation and exhaustion that comes from working round the clock, finding no time to sleep, no time to eat, permanently surrounded by bombing, and simply being in the middle of absolute distress\. Adrenaline can only keep you going for so long\. If doctors and nurses collapse, humanity collapses\. We must be determined not to let that happen,”_ says Meinie Nicolai, General Director of MSF\. The supported medics said that even with more supplies they would have no physical capacity left to continue treating all the wounded\. Several hospitals have been damaged in the recent bombings\.

Also the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights is [saying](http://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=85569) that more than 500 people lost their lives in Ghouta over the last days, including 190 women and children\. More than 2,400 were injured\. Around 350,000–400,000 people are believed still to live in the region\. It is one of the last areas held by rebel forces\.
### Greece

People who have received a second rejection struggle to continue to avail themselves of their rights, says Emergency Legal Aid \(ELA\) on Chios\. While “the arrest and deportation of applicants after notification of the second rejection of application is perfectly legal under the current framework”, people at this stage have no more right for free legal representation\. In some cases, the interval between arrest and deportation is too short for them to prepare another appeal\. ELA assumes the costs for an appeal at this stage of roughly €3000: €1300 for the court and approximately €1700 for legal fees\. “ The Organisations that contract lawyers to represent appellants pro bono are often unwilling to pursue these cases \[editors note: second rejection cases\] due to the already heavy caseloads of the available lawyers and the drain on their funding\. They are not legally required to provide free legal aid at this stage in the process\.

The prisoners of Section C in Larissa started protests for furloughs, [reports](https://enoughisenough14.org/2018/02/24/greece-prisoners-protesting-for-furloughs-in-larissa-prison-face-threats-for-riot-police-intrusion/) Enough is Enough\. They accuse the prison management of using “threats and blackmail” to stop the protest\. Even people who meet the requirements were denied furloughs\. “If things don’t change we will escalate our struggle by going on a hunger strike until the prison manager is removed,” stated the prisoners\. The manager, in response, threatened them with calling in the riot police to force them back inside\.
### Hungary

Activists have launched a [petition](https://www.thepetitionsite.com/de/817/038/056/end-your-xenophobic-attack-on-immigrants/) against the “Stop Soros” law, that aims to tackle humanitarian NGOs\. Further, they demand the government to stop its war on immigration\. More than 18,000 people have already signed the petition\. The aim for signatures is 19,000\.
