#### Feature: “Alex” Rescues 54 in Distress\. But Will It Become the Next Stranded Ship?

“Alex” from the rescue group [Mediterranea](https://www.facebook.com/Mediterranearescue/?__tn__=%2CdkCH-R-R&eid=ARDDMIw9s50bKq9fOX-VzyZm_nZVQIRLIT6wAnQDw9vCPWLrltTCYTsfZsvm808vzaQxNlmGEd9TuaNQ&hc_ref=ARRp193tVUeiszoBQKLG7_vNePkw8Euye2CqgIiPmlaEvGvhmH0vlmKl4iCR3oVBaFE&fref=nf&hc_location=group) rescued 54 people in distress of a raft, according to the group\. The NGO sent the coordinates of the distress call they received to MRCC Rome earlier in the morning, who replied that the information was forwarded to Libyan authorities\. Given the often violent record of Libyan Coast Guard “rescues” and the fact that it is unacceptable to return refugees to such conditions, the group decided to carry on with the rescue\. “These people must be saved, not sent back to die in Libya,” wrote the group in a public post\.

As of writing, all 54 people have been taken aboard Alex\. Among them are 11 women, three of whom are pregnant, and four children, according to volunteers from [Mediterranea](https://www.facebook.com/Mediterranearescue/?__tn__=%2CdkCH-R-R&eid=ARDDMIw9s50bKq9fOX-VzyZm_nZVQIRLIT6wAnQDw9vCPWLrltTCYTsfZsvm808vzaQxNlmGEd9TuaNQ&hc_ref=ARRp193tVUeiszoBQKLG7_vNePkw8Euye2CqgIiPmlaEvGvhmH0vlmKl4iCR3oVBaFE&fref=nf&hc_location=group) \. The group reported that the Libyan Coast Guard arrived on the scene shortly after the people were rescued but left quickly afterwords\.

The ship has asked MRCC Rome to grant permission to disembark in Lampedusa\. Given Italy’s current policy of refusing rescue ships, it seems unlikely that the ship will be able to dock soon\. Carola Rackete, the captain of the rescue ship “Sea\-Watch,” which was stuck outside of Lampedusa earlier this month, was only released from jail a few days ago\.

As the ship was en route to its rescue operation, it encountered the remains of a possible “ghost wreck,” a deflated dinghy floating in the Mediterranean\. “There was no indication of a rescue,” the group wrote\. “How many dead we will never know\.” This empty wreck is the direct consequence of Italy’s policy of stranding and prosecuting rescue ships\.

### Libya
#### Updates on 01/07 Bombing of Tajoura Detention Facility

More information has been coming out in the wake of the bombing earlier this week of the Tajoura dentention center in Tripoli\. Over 40 people were reported killed in the bombing, which was carried out by a militia group\. However, texts messages sent from those inside the prison suggest that the number may be [actually much higher, possibly over 100](https://twitter.com/sallyhayd/status/1146709158214942721) \.

There have also been reports that the [guards fired at people who were trying to flee](https://www.tpi.it/2019/07/04/libia-guardie-sparano-migranti-dopo-raid-tagiura/?fbclid=IwAR3MtvnUjx3E5InLB2vGrxGx8NIqt3hfQDUft5nwbNmXJyX5kpe7lHrwoDE) in the aftermath of the attack\. Those inside the prison say they have not only had no medical treatment since the attack, but are without food and water\.

#### HRW Submits Report on Torture in Greece

Human Rights Watch submitted a report to the United Nations Committee Against Torture on cruel treatment of refugees and migrants across the country in preparation for the UN Committee’s review of Greece\. The report covers a number of issues in detail, including police and military violence against refugees, the mass explulsion and illegal push\-backs of refugees in the Evros region, and the inhumane treatment of unaccompanied minors\. You can see the report in full [here](https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/07/04/human-rights-watch-submission-united-nations-committee-against-torture-greece?fbclid=IwAR1uqOF9ZW9kU5U8NIBmIIhrtXSmLlCSG-RHeKyj1uamDVXaBMmpzRoaGlc) \.

A 48 year old man, who worked as an academic, has been arrested for charges of arson, damage of foreign property, serial threats, and illegal gun possession\. The man is an alleged leader of Krypteía, a fascist terror cell that splintered out of the Golden Dawn political party\. The group partly gained infamy after it attacked and firebombed the home of Amir, an 11 year old Afghani refugee\. Amir was targeted by the group for being the flag\-bearer for his school in a Greek parade\.

### France
#### 22 Civil Society Groups Criticize “Biometric File” of Minor Refugees

An [open letter signed by 22 organizations](http://www.infomie.net/spip.php?breve4004&lang=fr&fbclid=IwAR1DBjRUlXVSLvsto0IyzsPxM3qhZAB9G1gsWDHit3EbVi8blkItGr0C-u0) was published today criticizing France’s policy of keeping a “biometric file” on unaccompanied minors\. The procedure has been criticized for not being in the best interests of the minors, and also for being scientifically unsound\. The procedure begins with a database cross\-check of fingerprints, which has been critized as unreliable by the signing organizations\.

Tous Migrants has released a “guide to solidarity,” informing volunteers of their rights and the law\. You can read it in full [here](http://www.delinquantssolidaires.org/?fbclid=IwAR3zxMViPMbiKwhkP8Zwc5qS2wqAey0qj8h5rhlyoihwsZOnMvLYqvStdeU) \.
