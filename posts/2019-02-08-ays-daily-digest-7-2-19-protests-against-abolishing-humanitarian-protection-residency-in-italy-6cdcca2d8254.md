Following the outcry from the [Salvini’s degree back in November](https://www.pri.org/stories/2019-02-01/after-salvini-decree-evictions-refugees-italy-face-uncertain-future) to target asylum\-seekers’ rights by abolishing “humanitarian protection” residency permits, protests happened in Vicenza on Thursday\.

### Syria

6 weeks after the downpour of the rainstorm, the displacement camps in the Idlib province are still facing catastrophic living conditions\. There continues to be a severe lack of medical aid and food to distribute\. Tents have either been torn apart or sunk into the mud\. For more information from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights look [here](http://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=115752&fbclid=IwAR2YGN1KyzLqXgeFKFD9NKaBoAdRqtZZOq02NftjQn-hVb8J_lW_nV0VH20) \.
### Turkey

[According to](https://www.facebook.com/GlobalDTM/photos/a.179695088858385/1122956651198886/?type=3&theater) the Turkish Directorate General for Migration Management \(DGMM\) there are now 4 million non\-Turkish people residing in Turkey seeking international protection\.

[The majority](https://www.facebook.com/GlobalDTM/photos/a.179695088858385/1122956651198886/?type=3&theater) are from Syria \(3,640,466 people\) and the other mainly inlcude people from Afghanistan, Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Somalia and as well as other countries\.
### Libya

There were [protests](https://twitter.com/sallyhayd/status/1093517120703528962/photo/1) today in Khoms Souq al Khamise dc at frustrations towards UNHCR when they apparently took 10 new arrivals for evacuation\. Others have been detained for 10 months and still have not been registered by UNHCR\. The protests included mostly teenagers, but about 40 women were also involved\.

[Libyans](https://twitter.com/sallyhayd/status/1093517120703528962/photo/1) showed up in the evening to take about 50 people to another detention centre\. At the time of this reporting there is no confirmation that they made it to the detention centre\. The concern is that this was the same excused used at the start of January, when people were forced back to smugglers\.
