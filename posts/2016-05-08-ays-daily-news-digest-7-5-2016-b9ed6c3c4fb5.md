THe spokeswoman for UNHCR in Lebanon, D\.

The percentage of Syrian refugees in Lebanon living under the poverty line — approximately $3\.84 a day — drastically increased from 49 percent in 2014 to more than 70 percent in 2015\. Single mothers and people with specific healthcare needs are prioritized for resettlement\.

### Volunteers report on the yesterday’s distribution incident at the E1 School Box in Piraeus\.

A volunteer \(not belonging to the School box project\) was mistakenly given the key to the box\. That volunteer \(who was with another group\) then initiated an unplanned distribution in front of the box and began taking photos of the children, refusing to stop after repeated requests by the School Box volunteer\. This created almost immediate chaos\. Volunteers repeatedly advise against unplanned distributions\. This is even more important with children\. It puts children at risk because they are afraid of not getting what they need and they respond accordingly\. Volunteers have also repeatedly asked volunteers not to take photos of children, especially where there is no consent from parents or guardians\. Please put the safety and security of the children first\. They need the stable environment of projects like the School Box and volunteers who think before they act\.

According to Messaggero Veneto, the situation could be soon become critical for refugees and migrants in Pordenone, the city in Friuli\-Venezia\-Giulia, the Italian region at the border with Austria and Slovenia\.

Since the asylum registration procedure is being slower that during the previous period, refugees might wait on the streets even for a couple of days\. The local media reported that a few nights ago, 14 people slept on the streets\.

A part of the group was accompanied by the volunteer group Rete Solidale to the ex\-Fair, but in the meantime they realized that the blankets were stolen from the refugees\. This is why they ask for blankets, but also male jeans trousers, male snickers \(no\. 41–45\) and warm shirts\.
