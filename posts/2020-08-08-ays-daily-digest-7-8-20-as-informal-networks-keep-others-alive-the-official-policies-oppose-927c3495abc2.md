Palestinian and Syrian **refugees living in Lebanese refugee camps have [offered to give away their houses](https://aforrefugees.org/2020/08/07/lebanon-in-refugees-proposes-to-give-their-houses-to-beirut-explosion-victims/?fbclid=IwAR03SaLR3Gxatzouopvkmd_YJXaRz2qSre760zb1kYzJvlc009Llg6f3Gjg) to those in need\.**

Some of the organisations helping refugees are now also organising support to those affected by the catastrophe and the families of the victims\. In the coming days we will feature some of the ways you can get involved, support, provide aid or take part in direct help\. Follow the AYS Daily News Digest for more info\.

One of the organisations providing support is **Anera** \. Find out more [here\.](https://www.anera.org/?fbclid=IwAR2lVogUY5ZKvZzoPxg5Lp2WFuE_nphs8gGBWIQBaucrdC8-p-UrFcr9bG8)

Also, there is a **fundraising to repatriate females houseworkers back to Sierra Leone:**


> The situation of domestic workers in Lebanon is critical : the sanitary restrictions left many jobless, while others saw their incomes cut off, or suffered from an increased number of abuses\. There is no specific organisation able to respond to their basic needs in Beirut\. While most NGOs in Lebanon provide alimentary relief for refugees, they usually support domestic workers for legal and administrative processes\. However what they need the most right now is basic relief such as shelter or food\. 





\(…\)


> These women are heroes who left their country and sacrificed their lives hoping to offer a better future to their children\. Instead, they were imprisoned in a modern slavery network and deprived of their passports\. These are real tragedies impacting their lives, but also the ones of their children, parents, family, and their whole social circles back in Sierra Leone\. The mental, social, and economic consequences run deep for the home country\. 





It is a short\- term but necessary solution\. The targeted amount \(US$ 2000\) has been calculated according to their cost of living\.

With nine new cases of COVID\-19 among locals in Lesvos, it brings the total current number of infected to 14 confirmed cases on the island\. Most are residents of Plomari where, according to the media [reports](https://www.stonisi.gr/post/10586/ennea-eginan-ta-kroysmata-sto-plwmari-realtime?fbclid=IwAR3TBmCwTN0CaCasAMYW9o-V36d4QRftq86sU5x6MX2BCUVzTT0fyG1_FwU) , public spaces of the village are constantly disinfected as a precaution\.
### A fine of € 5000 for breaking quarantine and entering the Greek territory?

23 Turkish citizens, including 10 children, arrived at around 7\.00 in the afternoon of Thursday, August 6th, by boat at the area of ​​Afani Naftis in Vrontados, Chios\.
The port officials [reportedly](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fchiosnews.com%2Fvgikan-ston-afani-nayti-23-toyrkoi-polites-zitisan-politiko-asylo%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR3ExN0ed8txjat6PPKIXT1ZcnUvD-SPGcB_A_llUHu-dMQuloVN7YVeyMM&h=AT1w5YT3lgAnAZ6lIRXVwSXBTlADWbbl9feC_ftuO-9sQ26kYzsw_hri9OyJdN_hfxAOvWHrR4wTt9f1GQAl3RKJrXtFRwTbTcfvJyrdMIr5cve699bnkdt6xKyCJFYDojU7GbMHvKTjYw) arrested them, but the Turkish citizens asked for political asylum as they are persecuted in their country, while it was found that they were families\. Later in the day, they were transferred to the quarantine structure in the area of ​​Lefkonia\. Tomorrow they are expected to take a coronavirus test and if it turns out that they are not carriers, they will be given the relevant documents and will move to Athens, for the examination of the request for political asylum\.
Also, two people have been detained as traffickers, one was the captain of the boat and the second, who is of Afghan origin, was on the beach of Vrontados\. The boat was confiscated\.

Unconfirmed sources say the refugees were given a fine of € 5000 for breaking quarantine and entering the Greek territory\.

The report says:
“On Saturday 25/7, a new prisoner in P\.R\. needed to go down to the infirmary section for her regular insulin injection\. While a policewoman was accompanying her there, another male officer offered to take her down instead\. The officer was a man called Dimitris who is well\-known as a rapist in the detention center and has been named in previous accounts of assault from women detainees\. Outside the infirmary, the woman was harassed by five officers\. Finally, she was transferred by Dimitris to the garage, instead of the 3rd floor, with the elevator, where he attempted to rape her\.” Read [more here](https://athens.indymedia.org/post/1606598/) , and denounce the violence — everywhere\.
### Action for Women invite you to support the pomegranate project

“From the corrosive effects of Covid19, civil unrest and racial violence in the US, rampant homelessness in Athens and now the tragedy that unfurled in Lebanon, the underlying themes of oppression, inequality and uncertainty can overwhelm many of us, creating a sense of helplessness\.

If there is anything we’ve learned from our sisters who have fled violence, conflict and persecution here in Greece, is that the human spirit is resilient\. After an initial successful pilot phase since May 18th post lockdown, we are proud to present the Pomegranate Project, shaped by our sisters’ voices\.


[![](https://prod-chuffedcontent.s3.amazonaws.com/images/pw6vEzmRTaSFyQZ0xNk8_images/gyM2zyMKQVu8wK3KgPb3_Screenshot%202020-07-08%20at%2016.34.09.png)](https://chuffed.org/project/secure-safe-housing-for-displaced-women?fbclid=IwAR30IB_YvUIc3coNsKusXRhYfR1788lHba-zFQL0x17ss0Pkr-Kv3-8KnZI#)


The pomegranate is the Greek and Persian symbol of regeneration, strength and new life\. Its seeds symbolise the lives each woman is striving to rebuild which we collectively work to protect and empower each other\.

The Pomegranate Project is the first of its kind in Greece\. It is run entirely by women, for women, offering a holistic programme to protect and empower women displaced by conflict and violence\. Women’s voices and experiences are always at the forefront of the Project\. We have been running activities and language/basic IT literacy classes under strict health measures here in Athens, providing women from multiple nationalities with the safe space to learn, develop skills while receiving psychosocial support\.”

This comprehensive approach is the much needed response that requires significant financial support from civil society\. With your support, our sisters can access a holistic protection and empowerment programme to recover, heal and integrate into their new home\.

### 22 days homeless with no solution in sight

After three of the settlements that housed almost 400 people burned down in the recent fires in Huelva, most of the survivors have lost everything: money, photos, documentation and even dogs that they had taken in\. This Wednesday they once again stood with dignity in a demonstration that began at 10 in the morning and lasted for three hours whereby they have called for a solution for all the people affected by these fires, most of whom originally come from Mali and Senegal\. In their statements to [the media](https://www.publico.es/sociedad/lepe-22-dias-calle-temporeros-afectados-incendios-lepe-siguen-recibir-solucion.html?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=publico&fbclid=IwAR2HB3WZzMHkazRksTMLg9X07kxFHj4dlt2UjvIHLxpV9m41AYRG-Uglx-A) , the affected ones said that they do not want a free home, but to “pay for a home with a decent solution that can be sustained with work\.”


> The government knows under what conditions we work, businessmen know that they do not comply with the law, people know how we live 




It is the daily, omnipresent, structural racism that crashes against the people, what bothers most the people working as agricultural workers in Lleida, who have for a while now been raising their voices about the abuse at work and working conditions that are below any legal and standard minimum\.

6people per room, sharing plates, forks, showers, while every day more companions fell ill\. If they were concerned about our health, they would not have left us living there — one of the workers says, as they are taken into the operational health point organized by _Proactiva Open Arms_ volunteers\. The workers who tested positive for COVID\-19 were reportedly taken away to the health facility by the police in such a manner that further exacerbated the discriminative practices in place for the people of colour, as many of them witnessed\.

#### GERMANY
### As in the case of Berlin, Seehofer prohibits the state reception program of Thuringia

The Federal Minister of the Interior, Horst Seehofer, opposed the admission of refugees from the Greek islands via the state reception program of the Thuringian state government, just as previously in the case of the city of Berlin, a scandalous decision, as AYS previously reported\. Now, the Federal Ministry of the Interior prevented the state’s admission program, media [reports\.](https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/horst-seehofer-stoppt-thueringer-programm-zur-fluechtlingsaufnahme-a-00000000-0002-0001-0000-000172378481?fbclid=IwAR2Htjv4dMiEygknPavrmOGUSYaZIMD-wV13xpwx36NLWnpmAJ4fEJM4P0M)

#### DENMARK
### “It is the absolute main priority that as few people as possible should seek asylum in Denmark”

The Danish government, who supports a program in which Rwanda helps to receive asylum\-seekers and refugees from Libya’s detention centres, has now decided to only accept 200 refugees from Rwanda, as the immigration minister concluded the previously defined number of 500 people was far too much\. In his arguments, he cites data on employment\.

36 percent of refugees aged 21–64, along with family reunified with them, were in employment after three years in Denmark\. Among men, 57 percent were in employment in the first quarter of 2020, but only 17 percent of women, according to the official statistics\.

Last year, 2,716 people applied for asylum in Denmark, but in the first seven months of 2020, only 830 new asylum seekers have been registered — primarily due to the COVID\-19 crisis\. That is almost a halving of the number of applicants\.

#### UK
### Deportation practice “wrong in principle and will be dangerous in practice”

Raising concerns that the move could risk spreading COVID\-19 between countries, the UK will now continue with their practice of deportations, without any precautions in terms of COVID\-19, no testing or measures to make sure a spread of the virus is not being practiced, alongside this [highly criticised](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/home-office-asylum-seekers-deportation-coronavirus-a9657761.html?fbclid=IwAR3YZ0dHGNqy8o3-jDyTESMfsC6UPzVtRBxUH9Gq0-d_da2jZ-8ezthZk6w) practice by the British government\.


> “This utterly reckless step risks spreading coronavirus across borders\. As so often happens, immigration enforcement is being prioritised over public health,” 




— director of Bail for Immigration Detainees said\.

235 people were discovered in small boats while crossing France to England — according to PA news agency, the most recorded in a single day\. 
In July alone, according to PA, more than 1000 people were picked up as they crossed the busy sea slope, News from the Med reported\. “The crossings are completely unacceptable and unnecessary as France is a safe country,” the British Secretary of State said\. He wanted to reconcile stronger measures with the French side, including intercepting boats and deporting migrants\.
