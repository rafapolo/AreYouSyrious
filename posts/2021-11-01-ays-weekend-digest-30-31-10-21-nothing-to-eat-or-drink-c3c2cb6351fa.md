### THE MEDITERRANEAN

[Mission Lifeline](https://mission-lifeline.de/) ’s search and rescue vessel has been operating in the area since Saturday night, the team reported:


> _Not an easy thing with the very critical weather conditions hours ago, but the situation has calmed down in the meantime\. While the ship’s crew is working, none of us can simply sleep at home in Dresden\. Our back office is available day and night in shifts\. We follow the weather and position from here and are kept up to date by the bridge\. This is nothing compared to what the ship’s crew does, of course, but it is important\._ 





At least 141 people coming from Maghreb and Sub\-Saharan Africa on board five boats were rescued off the Canary Islands, according to data provided by the Department of the Ministry of Development\.


> _Without the support of trusted adults, these children and teenagers face particular and significant protection risks\. They are easy prey for people smugglers, traffickers, abusers and exploiters\. On their journeys they risk forced labour, extortion, arbitrary detention and physical violence, including sexual violence\._ 





> _These young people embark on their journeys for a whole range of reasons\. In many cases, they are fleeing [war\-torn countries](https://www.msf.org/war-and-conflict) , prosecutions, extreme poverty, human rights violations and limited access to education and health services\. Many of those rescued on Geo Barents’ most recent mission come from [Somalia](https://www.msf.org/somalia) , Eritrea, [Mali](https://www.msf.org/mali) and [Cameroon](https://www.msf.org/cameroon) \._

### Lesvos and deportations

Mytilene has become the absolute hell for the people who continue to be deported illegally, despite the international outcry\. No longer by port officials, but by men of Athens services dressed in politics, as residents of the island said to the local media outlet [tvxs\.gr\.](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftvxs.gr%2Fnews%2Fellada%2Fkatoikoi-mytilinis-tin-epanaproothisi-anelaban-asfalites-fobomaste-na-dosoyme-koybertes-%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2j_4wb_nIF3krQkWlhFlwEMdoFsmGvZfjQsFyE4ls6fETxgkGEPf8NcqY&h=AT3CJGqUQIIyaid1jnolP_JCbfeOVpfqxDIpolRNmMS2iMVcg-9X3bTm1sCbVq2SzLZeE2-WV3zGG7KzbiV8-2JAI-VFl3ujPTwNH85Ifc6Vv3bESx4KogRQx_E3ZyDjwAshVmQIwxbjFw&__tn__=R]-R&c[0]=AT2BA5El0n0ru3v9J9N12xqFu9au1xus4D-fiM99tzIz9d6hNAq1M9RqkJ1P7Z2aoYDFzLi-zak5muCzkxL3yvQhmpZUSmNxTGJDC369xjuuAcZNJwz13Sz05BAy7Z_d3KqbTPOf5hZdvWVpHsKr2I25Pk6pt5szJba4S4zFaCpqsWlCVurFwBCCEz5GIfS1mzZT7TLKl7bIphXOPIGbClJM_hZmShM)


> _“Since last July, we have seen men in civilian clothes, on motorcycles without license plates and often covered features\. They sit in the area of ​​Sykamia on the dirt roads, so that if a boat comes out they can pick them up before they go out and take pictures\. \(…\)_ 





> _“The boats leave from Molyvos to Skala Sykamias\. The refugees run out and hide in the olive groves\. They are looking in the fields\._ 
 

> _When they locate the refugees, they immobilize them, and tie their hands with tyrap that they have in a backpack they have on their back\.”_ 




### Sights from Ritsona
### New arrivals and the practice of pushbacks

In the afternoon the cargo ship with about 400 people was to arrive in Kos, where the people were supposed to be transferred to the Reception and Identification Center in Pyli\.

The pushbacks and the policies of the current government are a tight subject at the moment, as some note\. On the one hand, it wants to ensure its \(far\) right\-wing voter pool that the “borders are shut” while it also must reassure bodies like LIBE and the EU that they are not really taking place, as [@phesimeonid](https://twitter.com/phesimeonid) noted\.

A priest and two activists in Calais are now on day 19 of a hunger strike in a desperate attempt to draw attention to the plight of refugees in Calais\. Philippe Demeestère, Anaïs Vogel and Ludovic Holbein — all of whom work with people on the move — are staying in the St\-Pierre de Calais church, refusing food to demand that the authorities:


> _\- Stop evicting refugees and dismantling their camps during the winter_ 





> _\- Stop confiscating tents and belongings_ 





> _\- Open a dialogue with NGOs about distribution of essential aid_ 





> _Sunday will be their 21st day of hunger strike\. We continue to be with populations in distress, together, mobilized to ensure respect for human dignity, in the hope of a dignified society\._ 




### DENMARK
### On the implications of Denmark’s non\-renewal practice

In Denmark, Syrians from Damascus province with no individual risk are subject to cessation or non\-renewal, on the basis of apparently improved security conditions\. Forced returns are not carried out\.

The Danish Refugee Appeals Board now met to consider the implications of the case for Denmark’s cessation practice, Nik Tan, a senior researcher for [HumanRightsDK](https://twitter.com/HumanRightsDK) writes\. The Board found that the case did not provide a basis for a change in its practice vis\-à\-vis Syrians, repeating its precautionary principle including with respect to risk upon entry into Syria\.


> _In recent weeks, Denmark made [international headlines](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/14/world/europe/denmark-syrian-residence-permits.html?smid=tw-share) with its refusal to extend residence permits for Syrian subsidiary protection holders in Denmark from the Damascus province\. Denmark’s emergence as the first state in Europe to end the protection of Syrians on the basis of improved conditions in the wider Damascus area is the result of a self\-described [‘paradigm shift’](https://brill.com/view/journals/nord/90/1/article-p60_60.xml) in Danish refugee policy dating back to 2015\. This contribution is a brief account of the emergence of Danish temporary protection and cessation practice with respect to Syrians and points to some outstanding human rights and refugee law questions raised by the Danish example\._

In the meantime, the country doesn’t refrain from violating the 1951 Convention, too:
