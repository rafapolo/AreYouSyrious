#### FEATURE

Since 2015, Europol has reported that [over 10,000 refugee children](http://www.dw.com/en/more-than-10000-migrant-children-missing-europol/a-19014669) have gone missing on the European continent\. Some lost their lives while fleeing with their families, but in all of those cases the children’s rights that the western world has polished up individually do not apply, it seems\.

It has been a year since [**the death of Madina Hussiny**](ays-daily-digest-1-6-2018-who-is-responsible-for-the-horrow-we-are-living-in-85ee87c1c3a7) , a little refugee girl who [died on the night of Nov 20](https://www.facebook.com/areyousyrious/posts/zbogom-madina-goodbye-madina-dva-sata-smo-prolazili-hrvatskom-kada-nas-je-polici/916183278530556/) /Nov21\. Though the police, responsible for the pushback that sent them to the dark railroads and, ultimately, her fate, are complicit in Madina’s death, nobody has been found guilty as of today\. 
Later on, as Madina’s family was in serious danger inside of the Croatia’s border territory, an AYS volunteer went to notify the border police\. This volunteer ended up [sentenced at court](http://www.statewatch.org/news/2018/sep/croatia-ays-case.htm) for “assisting an illegal border crossing\.”

While Madina’s death serves as a constant call to some people to always do what they can to prevent such perilous situations, it evidently meant nothing for those here who “serve and protect\.”

Minors are often treated like adults, both by police and by [the reception teams and facilities](ays-news-digest-unaccompanied-minors-in-refugee-centers-45f54d954542) across Europe\. Already last year it was documented that the number of **unaccompanied minors** entering Europe has skyrocketed since the start of the recent crisis in 2015\. The number of unaccompanied children worldwide has increased fivefold\. Among the myriad problems that refugees face, one of the most serious is the issue of education\.
### ‘Universal’ right to education

Overall, about 4 million refugees aged 5 to 17 were out of school in 2017, [GEM Report](http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002659/265996e.pdf) for 2019 notes\. Educational opportunities of children affected by internal migration may be compromised for several reasons, from precarious legal status to poverty, inadequate government attention, or biases and stereotypes\. The legal, educational, and administrative responses to the education plight of the internally displaced are often similar to those for refugees\.
In destination countries, immigrants often leave education early\. According to the GEM report, in the European Union, 10% of natives and 19% of foreign\-born people aged 18 to 24 left school early in 2017\. Dropout can depend on arrival age; outcomes vary considerably by whether students enter host systems at the beginning, middle or end of compulsory education\. Extremists tend to instrumentalize development challenges or exacerbate them to create and exploit a vicious circle of marginalization, particularly affecting the poorest and most vulnerable\.


> The education needs of unaccompanied migrant minors, who are particularly vulnerable to exploitation, are frequently unmet\. 




Their number worldwide increased from 66,000 in 2010–2011 to 300,000 in 2015–2016\. Unfortunately, most of the specially designed programmes for refugees aim at young children, mothers or those who are already enrolled in school, where many young boys and teenagers are left unattended and even stigmatized\.

Faced with crises, most governments’ reflexive response is to offer education to refugee populations in a parallel system\. However, a consensus supposedly developed that this is not a sustainable solution, even though that’s not what it looks like from the practice\. The degree of refugee inclusion varies across displacement contexts\. Prejudice and discrimination are present in many education systems, despite policies against them\. In **Bosnia** , except for a few cases, refugee children have not had the chance to enter the educational system, and now that it has been publicly announced, [the reactions are reportedly very different](https://www.klix.ba/vijesti/bih/djeca-migranti-ce-ici-u-os-brekovica-u-bihacu-mjestani-najavili-ispisivanje-svoje-djece/181119088?utm_medium=Status&utm_source=Facebook&utm_content=181119088&utm_campaign=Klix.ba+Facebook+status&fbclid=IwAR2Kdd-aPXCUhjl9e_gkRuuDQU0dEPD_Db8RnfWl-Pic_pUV9bNGMB2sFDQ) to what one would expect from people who have lived through war — and most of them as refugees, too\.

About 73% of the 86,000 minors who arrived in **Italy** between 2011 and 2016 were unaccompanied\. Despite legislation in 2015 and 2017 aimed at protecting them, only a minority regularly attend school\. In many conflict\-affected countries, internal displacement has strained already struggling education systems\. Financial literacy is low in many traditional regions of countries of origin and low\-skill migrant communities, leaving refugees open to fraud or financial exploitation\. This happens both to the parents of children and to unaccompanied minors, thus affecting greatly the potential future development of children\.
### Case: Croatia

The attitude toward refugee minors in Croatia has not changed significantly since [we reported on it](ays-daily-news-digest-17-1-massive-negligence-of-minors-and-serious-police-abuse-remain-silently-38c0815bdec5) and called out the responsible Ministry\. Even more, unaccompanied minors who are staying in a children’s home in the eastern city Osijek have not been included in school for the past 3 years, adding another issue to the pile that Croatia may have to answer for in Strasbourg\.
The extent to which teacher education includes diversity varies by country, so even when children do get their 70 hours of language learning in Croatia, it is often done by teachers who have not had additional training for teaching Croatian as a second language\.

The example of Ahmad is illustrative\. He has been staying at the Children’s Home in Osijek and nobody included him in high school education, though the facility was obliged to do so\.


> _Today he is 19 and has no qualification, nor the ability to continue his education in Croatia\._ 





The state is taking away valuable time from these children and minors in the state institutions that are responsible for enabling the right to education, but they seem to simply not care, and there are no sanctions for such negligent behavior\. Along with the imperative to enter the system at all, the state should minimize time spent in schools not following the national curriculum or not progressing towards recognized certificates, as such time compromises education trajectories and leaves consequences that our near\-sighted politicians don’t seem to recognize at the moment\.

Children who arrived to the country through the process of resettlement are also not included in the education system, though no official obstacle exists, apart from the 30\-day ‘deadline’\. IOM, the organisation responsible for them, awaits for the Ministry’s decision, but by now we should all be aware that there won’t be any unless we all act and push for progress, if we care about those we are helping and, in their case, working with\.


> Respecting the right to education must go beyond legislation and administrative process\.
