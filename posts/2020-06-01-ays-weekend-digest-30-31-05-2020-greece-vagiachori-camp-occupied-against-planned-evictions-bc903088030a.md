#### GREECE: Vagiachori camp occupied in response to today’s planned evictions

The Vagiochori camp in northern Greece, was peacefully [occupied](https://www.efsyn.gr/ellada/koinonia/245630_eiriniki-katalipsi-domis-apo-prosfyges) by residents protesting against today’s planned evictions, asylum delays and the exclusion of children from education\.

According to plans, today the Greek government will start evicting up to 8,300 recognised refugees from mainland camps and Estia houses\. While this has been promoted as a way to accommodate people from the islands, no alternative support has been put in place for those who will remain without housing\. Furthermore, at the same time, recognised refugees will also lose their cash support, facing homelessness with no help in sight\.


> The root cause of the problem is that there are very few integration programs available for asylum seekers and recognised refugees: how can you integrate in society and become a productive member of it if you don’t have access to language classes? If nobody explains to you how to get a tax number or how to access the job market? If your children don’t have access to Greek school? \( [Refugees to Refugees R2R Solidarity Call Centre](https://web.facebook.com/1039101139520127/posts/2951236178306604) \) 





A joint letter has been written by more than 60 organisation to EU and Greek officials\. Read it [HERE](https://helprefugees.org/news/8300-refugees-to-be-evicted-from-their-homes-in-greece-joint-letter-to-eu-and-greek-officials) \.

In Vagiachori, which during the last months hosted around 770 people, this will mean that around 150 people could be evicted today, EFSYN [report](https://www.efsyn.gr/ellada/koinonia/245630_eiriniki-katalipsi-domis-apo-prosfyges) \.


> The remaining 620 say they are very angry because the delay in the asylum application review procedures is such that for many the appointment has been set for… 2022\! There are also many complaints about the behavior of the relevant asylum services\. 





Schooling and healthcare are also key points among the protestors’ demands\. Of the more than 200 minors in the camp, around 120 children cannot attend primary school, while local authorities could agree to provide a building and resources for compulsory education\.

The national health organisation, despite many calls, is also abstaining from vaccinating children in the camps\.

SEA

**95 people rescued off coast of Lampedusa**

On Sunday [95 people from Tunisia](https://twitter.com/AngiKappa/status/1267191949682970634?fbclid=IwAR1T2Fe46f1Qs7EQAZ4u1zXNPjNEnAoKK0c_mnPTDGmphxt_zCZgtJRlKpk) were rescued off the coast of Lampedusa having declared that their engine was faulty, they landed in the evening\.

MALTA

**Delays to Deaths at Sea Inquiry**

[Local media report](https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/migrant-inquiry-delay-police-chiefs-office-was-closed-when-complaint.795625?fbclid=IwAR2DmIhkGjlg9PYjt644mFVR5SyZqN2U8ldPJKGGPKR1A_ltsQcolFIEh7M) that a criminal complaint and request for an investigation into recent deaths at sea brought by NGO Repubblika has not been dealt with in a timely manner\. The complaint comes as at least five people died after Malta refused them safe harbour and those who survived were returned to Libya from Maltese waters in contravention of international law\.

GREECE
#### No end in sight\. More pushbacks to Turkey

Josoor [reported](https://twitter.com/JosoorNet/status/1267319463352897536) that around 90 people have been forcibly brought from different locations in Greece to Turkey this weekend — “young men, families, kids, pregnant women”\.

A group of 30 people [told](https://twitter.com/JosoorNet/status/1267319465613680640) Josoor that they were taken from camps near Thessaloniki with the promise of new documents\.


> Police then forced them on a refrigerated truck \( \! \) that took them to a strange, dirty place to stay for 2 days with 30 more people and then onto boats on \[the\] Evros river… 





> …As usually, they had their belongings stolen and many were beaten — one guy who tried to record the pushback was beaten so badly he had to be carried by the others and definitely had at least his leg broken, if not more\.

According to Aegean Boat Report [info](https://web.facebook.com/AegeanBoatReport/posts/842599319596507) , one boat landed in Tsona, northern Lesvos, with 54 people\. New arrivals will be taken to the quarantine camp in Megala Therma, Lesvos north for 14 days quarantine due to the coronavirus\.
#### Demonstration in Malakasa

Local residents have protested during the weekend against the two refugee camps hosted in the area\. Different groups were present at the demonstration\. While some reiterate racist attacks against people on the move, and criticise the presence of the camps only insofar as it affects their own town, others were there to express their solidarity with those forced to live in inhumane conditions or locked inside the new closed camp that has recently opened\.

The “Coordinating Committee of groups and Residents of NE Attica — Oropou” wrote a [statement](https://diodiastop.blogspot.com/2020/05/blog-post_31.html) , insisting that the fight against the camps in Malakasa is a fight for the closure of all camps and to “ensure decent housing and free movement for all\. Homeless, Unemployed, Refugees and Immigrants … For ALL people\.”


> We were present NOT to stand with the voices of those who are racists on the basis of different culture, NOT with the voices of those who consider immigration a crime\. 





> We remind that if we are oppressed and isolated, this does not justify keeping people trapped in prison structures of human souls\. If we feel that we are “drowning”, this does not justify drowning people in the Aegean\. Regularity is not that of absolute and tougher policing of closed structures … It is the struggle against open and closed concentration camps\.

SPAIN
#### Local hotels refuse to house migrant farm workers, in Lleida, Catalunya\.

For the last few weeks, hundreds of migrant farm workers have been forced to sleep on the streets of Lleida, in Catalunya\. Antiracist activist [Nogay Ndiaye](https://twitter.com/Nogay_13/status/1266635312324845569) has been working together with Senegalese football player Keita Balde, who offered to pay hotel expenses for up to 200 workers\. Most hotels have refused\.

The racist policies of Lleida’s hoteliers [mirror the institutional racism](https://twitter.com/destriem_ponent/status/1267137994433204226) of Catalan authorities and the exploitative policies of land and farm owners\. Work agreements are in place and state that housing has to be provided for seasonal workers, but they are constantly disregarded\.

> Almost 1,100 days of giant pots, fuel canisters, yummy dishes, camaraderie, tons of love, liters of water, full washing machines and clothes lines\. But also of sad moments, of seeing people, our friends, our brothers, being beaten and their rights trampled in their attempt to get a better life\. 





**Razor Wire order cancelled**

As we [reported last week](ays-daily-digest-26-05-2020-tensions-between-greece-and-turkey-ramp-up-53ff9ce5181b) the Serbian Ministry of defence had ordered razor wire to ‘secure’ the RICs in Serbia causing outcry from civil society and NGOs\. However, the order has now been [cancelled for this budget year](https://www.slobodnaevropa.org/a/30644479.html?fbclid=IwAR2EdIeqEtchBmHvSOW8wFtVfUMWzW_BtnaVYOzE41Itf8lE5IpT1Uaq2bM) as the COVID\-19 crisis is believed to be over\.

CROATIA

**Pushback report on children and unaccompanied children in Croatia**

A [new report](https://www.cms.hr/system/article_document/doc/647/Pushback_report_on_children_and_unaccompanied_children_in_Croatia.pdf) has been published by Border Violence Monitoring Network, Centre for Peace Studies, Society for Psychological Assistance, and Welcome Initiative\.


> The two most prevalent actions recorded in the pushback of children and unaccompanied children are physical assault and theft of possessions\. In 19% of recorded cases, groups including children and unaccompanied children were beaten by Croatian police during their pushback \(receiving impact injury from either fists, open palms, baton strikes, or other blunt implements\) \. Meanwhile, in 16% of cases, the groups including children were robbed by the authorities, acts which encompass the extraction of money, mobile phones, and possessions of personal/monetary value\. 





The full breakdown of types of violence used in push\-backs from Croatia \(2017–2020\) to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia where minors were involved is as follows — Other \(9%\); Gunshots \(3%\); Threatening with guns \(3\.5%\); Forcing to undress \(4%\); Pushing people on the ground \(4\.2%\); Exposure to extreme temperature in the car \(5%\); Reckless driving \(6%\); Insulting \(8%\); Kicking \(10%\); Destruction of personal belongings \(12%\); Theft of personal belongings \(16%\); Beating \(with batons/hands/other\) \(19%\) \. One testimony can include several types of violence\.

The report also includes a comic strip made by artists Ena Jurov detailing the story of Madina, an Afghan child killed during a pushback from Croatia in 2017\.

HUNGARY
#### Permanent state of emergency?

More analyses have come out, criticising the new emergency laws in Hungary\. Despite government claims that this new law is withdrawing the special powers accorded to government, it may actually pave the way for reducing further the role of parliament and allowing for easier ways to declare a state of emergency\.

LUXEMBOURG

**Update on unaccompanied children sent to Luxembourg from Greece**

[A report, written by a teenager](https://today.rtl.lu/life/people/a/1526248.html?fbclid=IwAR3dtsiPav7ydb4cRyiRLHE5S63nOYaUqYwu0_B92n9fYK1AUEu_Bma0Xk8) from Luxembourg, has been published by local media\. The teenager interviewed the president of Caritas Luxembourg who stated:


> They are doing very well\. A couple of days ago, we had a big celebration \(as far as this is possible in these times\) and they were very happy and in good spirits\. 





We wish them the very best and hope Luxembourg will chose to take more than 12 children next time\. There are still approximately 1,600 lone children in camps and police detention in Greece\.
