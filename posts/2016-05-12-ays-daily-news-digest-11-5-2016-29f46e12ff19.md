They are also not able to access legal services and are held in prison\-like conditions\. The MEPs report refugees are being pushed back to Turkey by Greek and Bulgarian police forces, adding “all refugees interviewed told us they were not given the opportunity to ask for asylum, neither in Greece nor in Turkey\.
